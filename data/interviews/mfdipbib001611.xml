                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape one, side one of an interview with Michael H.
                        Newlin. This is being done by the Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                        Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Today is September 29, 2006. Do
                        you go by Mike or Michael or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Mike is fine, Stu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's start at the beginning. When and where
                        were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was born May 16, 1926 in Greensboro, North Carolina. I lived in
                    Greensboro until I was approximately ten or eleven years old, and then we moved
                    to a small town in North Carolina, Sanford, where my father was CEO of a small
                    company that built railway motor cars. That, as we got closer to the war, it
                    became clear that metal and other materials were hard to get. The stockholders
                    sold the company while my father was in South America on a sales trip, and so he
                    found himself basically without a job. But he had contacts because he had built
                    one of the trains that was being used by the Panama Canal Railroad company. He
                    was hired by the railroad company to come and work as a mechanic on one of the
                    trains that he had built. So we moved to the Canal Zone, Balboa, shortly before
                    Pearl Harbor, and I went to high school there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to go back a bit. Tell me what do you know about
                        the background on let's say your father's family first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: My middle name is Holt, and my great, great grandfather was at one time
                    before the Civil War one of the richest men in North Carolina, Michael Holt in a
                    place called Saxapahaw. Michael Holt had the idea of bringing the machine to the
                    cotton rather than the cotton to the machine, and he built a dam on the Haw
                    River and opened up one of the first mills there. Of course that was burnt and
                    the dam blown up by Sherman during the Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope you will appreciate the fact that my grandfather
                        was an officer with Sherman.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well let it be said for the record that even though I have born a
                    southerner, I am glad the Civil War came out the way it did. So the family
                    basically, until my father came along, never recovered from this blow. His
                    father, I think, worked on the railroad in an office job. As a young man, my
                    father was working just simply as a mechanic building automobiles. It was rather
                    new in those days, still in the roaring 20's. He was obviously very good as a
                    mechanic. Then this company in Sanford needed somebody with skills, and he had
                    both technical and the managerial skills to build these trains. They ran either
                    on gasoline or diesel. But they ran on railroads, and they were very efficient.
                    They filled a niche. He would go to South America and get an order for one, and
                    come back and then build these trains, and then take them and assemble them. It
                    was remarkable that this small company in North Carolina built world class
                    products. One was built for the President of Argentina. He unfortunately died
                    right after I graduated from high school in 1943. It was while I was in high
                    school, and they said the deputy chief of mission at the embassy in Panama, Mr.
                    John J. Muccio, will come over and talk to the class about the foreign service.
                    That was how my interest in the foreign service got started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's go back on your mother's side. What can you
                        tell about your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: My mother was born up in the hills of North Carolina in a place called
                    Mount Airy at that time, very tiny little town. Then her father Mr. James Brady
                    went to Greensboro and opened up a sort of boarding house cum hotel called the
                    Blandwood in a very nice section of town. He was apparently a very successful
                    businessman. Unfortunately he was murdered one night. He went down to try to get
                    one of his employees out of the jail and somebody cut his throat and robbed him.
                    My mother then lived with my grandmother in a house in Greensboro. My father
                    happened to take a room in their house because there were just the two women
                    living in this big house, and that is how they met.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother go to college or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: My mother did go to college. She went to State College which was then a
                    female institution. She did, I think have a college degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you recall about Greensboro or Sanford in North
                        Carolina?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: I do have some recollection of Greensboro, and it was very favorable. We
                    were near, the place where we lived, Spring Garden Street, was near the state
                    college for women at that time, and they had a training school to teach
                    teachers. It was very well equipped. So I was enrolled in first grade, and the
                    teacher then called my mother one day and said, “Mrs. Newlin, I am sorry to have
                    to tell you this, but Mike cannot read.” My mother thought my goodness, I have
                    given birth to an idiot. She said, “I don't understand that. He seems like a
                    bright enough boy.” The teacher said, “Well have you been reading to him, Mrs.
                    Newlin?” She said, “Yes. I read Pilgrim's Progress, Beowulf, and then some Greek
                    myths.” “Well that is probably it. He is too bored with Jack and Jill Went Up
                    the Hill.” I remember that fondly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Sanford, where you moved. How about there. In the first
                        place these two places in North Carolina, did you have, did segregation
                        intrude on you at all to your knowledge or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well it was the typical situation at that time. My nanny in Greensboro
                    was a black woman named Mamie. Mother said that when Mamie died she went right
                    straight to heaven. One thing I remember as a boy in Greensboro during the
                    depression was in the evenings quite often they would get a knock on the back
                    door, and there would be a white man there saying, Ma'am, do you have some wood
                    that needs splitting, I need something to eat. Well we didn't have any wood to
                    split, but they gave him a meal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember we were in South Pasadena, California near the
                        railroad tracks in the 30's. We would make sandwiches. Speaking of reading,
                        did you find you were much of a reader as time went on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: In grade school I read Dos Passos USA. As well as some other good
                    books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get caught up in any of the kid books, Tom
                        Swift?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh I read Dr. Doolittle. Lofting. Hugh Lofting. Mother didn't appreciate
                    the literary qualities. She didn't know what it was all about. She said, “Well I
                    hope you are going to finish that Dr. Doolittle book.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. You were how old when you went to
                        the Canal Zone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I must have been, let's see, I was in the first year of high school. I
                    must have been, I was a freshman in high school, so I had four years to go, so I
                    must have been about 12 or 13.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went there in elementary school, were there any
                        subjects you particularly liked or that you didn't like, activities that you
                        got involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was always interested in music. I joined the glee club. A musical
                    instrument company came to town trying to start a band, so I decided I wanted to
                    play the snare drum. I wound up as a drummer in the band. I was not a great one
                    for sports. I will have to say that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me high school in the Canal Zone, the Canal Zone was
                        of course a special place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It was a very special place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk particularly the time you were there, this
                        would have been about '40 to 1944 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: We got there in '40.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the war started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. Shortly after we got there, the war started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe life there, and then we will talk
                        about school there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Heavenly. It was, I didn't realize at the time, it was strictly a
                    colonial experience. You had these five miles on either side of the canal that
                    was run by the United States. Everything was beautiful. You had a school, you
                    had accredited teachers. They had just built a brand new high school when I got
                    there. We had wonderful teachers. We had a symphony orchestra; we had a glee
                    club. We had band. Then the teachers were just excellent. You crossed the Fourth
                    of July Avenue over into Panama City, and you were in Central America. The
                    government was wise enough to tell the Panamanians that they would take care of
                    picking up the garbage and trash in Panama City and in Colon on the Atlantic
                    side. We had no real mosquitoes anywhere. It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you learn Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: A little bit. Not as much as I should have, but everybody just about that
                    we came into contact with spoke English. An interesting thing how time changes.
                    In Panama there were something called beer halls that were really very nice
                    night clubs. We as teenagers would go over there with our dates, and we would
                    all have Canadian Club and ginger ale or rum and coke. Nobody ever got drunk,
                    and parents thought this was just a natural part of growing up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well were there any Panamanian kids in the high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Very few. There were a few. I had one very good Panamanian friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the war. Did you feel were there a
                        lot of military restrictions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: We had blackouts, and we all built bomb shelters in our back yards. One
                    of the first things I remember after Pearl Harbor, they gave us lumber, and I
                    helped build. They were sort of a hut kind of thing with benches inside and then
                    with earth on the top and sides. Whether these would have done any good or not
                    I'm not sure, but at any rate we had them. But we did have blackouts, with
                    windows closed at nights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for the American Navy? I imagine you
                        were seeing lots of ships go by.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes we did. We had some visitors frequently from one of the cruisers that
                    used to cruise in the Pacific. They were friendly, and they would sometimes take
                    me with them over to Panama to the sort of more adult night clubs which for a
                    teenager was quite a revelation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about particularly in war time there must have been a
                        lot of navy going through on the ships. Did they sort of intrude or were
                        they literally ships that pass in the night?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: They would just mainly go through. I do remember that I worked after my
                    father died, I worked for a year in the mechanical division which was right in
                    Balboa Harbor sticking out into the harbor. I remember seeing the Roosevelt
                    aircraft carrier steam in after it had been bombed with the flight deck
                    cantilevered up. They did some emergency repairs. It was astounding that a

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When your father died, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well the Panama Canal Company was very good in that sense. They hired my
                    mother in sort of a clerk type job, so she worked there for a number of years,
                    while my two sisters, one of them two years younger, one of them five years
                    younger, completed high school. They then went back to North Carolina. The girls
                    went on to college and she went to work as a receptionist in Raleigh, North
                    Carolina at a hospital. Mother worked throughout most of her life. She loved
                    work, and so she was a house mother at Roanoke College in Virginia at one time,
                    and she died at the age of 93.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me now, you are getting ready to graduate in
                        1944. The war is on, what is going to happen to Michael Newlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well we were getting ready to graduate in '44. The president of our class
                    was a charismatic type that I had never come across anything like him in our age
                    group. The first of our class meetings that I attended, here was this godlike
                    creature saying things like, the chair recognizes so and so and dominating the
                    proceedings. This was Bob Whitham. So Whitham went off and signed up as a cadet
                    midshipman in the Merchant Marine Academy. He did that before graduation because
                    he wanted to be sure to get also a commission in the Naval Reserve and not be
                    drafted into the army. So at his advice, since I admired him as a role model,
                    before graduation I signed up and went off to Pass Christian and Biloxi to the
                    Merchant Marine Academy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have two of them or something? I thought there
                        was Kings Point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Kings Point is up in New York. I attended a basic school in Mississippi.
                    I think we were in Pass Christian. I believe you were supposed to do one year or
                    two years down there, and then go on to Kings Point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you decide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I was there only a relatively short amount of time, and I got a
                    severe ear infection and perforated ear drums, so I went back to the Canal Zone.
                    That would have been in the summer of '44. Then my father died later on that
                    fall. I had to drop out of the junior college, and I went to work in the
                    mechanical division. I worked all the overtime I could. I was a drill press
                    operator. At the end of the year I had saved $1,000. So I wanted to go to
                    college. I applied to Harvard, and they accepted me. And with $1,000 in my
                    pocket I went off to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Then I worked my way through
                    college with scholarships and worked part time for the university. I graduated
                    cum laude in '49. I knew by that time I really wanted to go into the foreign
                    service. I seem to remember tuition, room and board was $1,500.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back. Let's talk about Harvard first.
                        You got to Harvard starting in about '45?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, '45.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Harvard when you got there, I mean the
                        veterans hadn't started to come back yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: They were starting to come back, but still the ROTC was marching up and
                    down Harvard Yard and that kind of thing. There were a lot of military present.
                    I guess the reason I got in was I was one of the few eligible males. I would
                    never get into Harvard today. At any rate I got in, and that was because
                    President Conant and Buck, the dean, wanted to, and I think it started before
                    Conant, they wanted to get outside the elite New England prep schools. So they
                    wanted some people that they thought might have some future from outside New
                    England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What house were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Leverett House in a beautiful room overlooking the Charles River. Harvard
                    has the house system similar to colleges at Oxford where you live, eat and
                    interact with classmates. They too contribute to one's education. As I say
                    because I wanted, I didn't know whether I would get into the foreign service or
                    if I got in I didn't know whether I would like the foreign service, so I said I
                    want a second string to my bow. So I went to my faculty advisor and said, “This
                    is my problem. I don't know whether I want to apply to the law school or whether
                    I want to apply to the business school.” He looked at me and said, “Young man,
                    which ever one you go to, you will never be hungered.” I chose then the business
                    school because that was two years rather than three years. There the tuition by
                    that time had gone up. Even though I continued to work over in the college, I
                    still had to take out a student loan. But for what they have to take out now
                    days it wasn't anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about when you were at Harvard. What were you
                        majoring in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I majored in government with a second in economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With government, what does this mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It is really political science. We were so fortunate to have Merle
                    Fainsod, who had of course worked in the government during the war. His tales
                    about how government really works rather than what you were getting in the
                    textbook was priceless.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine you were getting did you feel you were
                        getting a good dose of international interest and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes, everything. Everything that was going on. I think it was the
                    first year I was there at graduation they presented honorary degrees to the
                    joint chiefs. They had Eisenhower and all the other joint chiefs. It was a
                    strong, and as you say the veterans started coming back then. I was very
                    interested. They were all in the same house and everything, so over lunch or
                    dinner to talk about their experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it was much more, I went to Williams as a non veteran
                        from '46 to '50. I have very much the same thing. In a way I absorbed the
                        maturity of the veterans by being around them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That is right. One of the veterans I got to know. He was in the jungles
                    of I guess Okinawa I suppose, and I said to him, “Gee that must have been really
                    awful. The Japanese were so fanatical and fight to the last man. Wasn't that
                    hard to cope with?” He said, “Well we were better scrappers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, how about some of your professors? Did any stick in
                        your mind now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes indeed. I was sort of in a way adopted by one of the professors,
                    Professor Kemp. He was a bachelor who lived with another bachelor, Derwwod
                    Stainthorpe Whittlesley, who was a writer on the whole international political
                    thing. They used to invite younger people for dinner occasionally and
                    everything. He just sort of became in loco parentis. Fortunately when they made
                    a trip to Europe, they asked me to go along as their chauffeur. That is
                    something when we get to that point helped me get into the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well were you there in '48 when Marshall made his speech
                        that kicked off the Marshall Plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you must have felt very much in the center of, I mean
                        obviously the events of the reconstruction of Europe, the menace of
                        communists and all must have been playing itself out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: All of the stories then began to emerge about the holocaust as well. And
                    then of course, for somebody with my background, the cultural life of Boston was
                    incredible. Here I was out of Panama out of Balboa Canal Zone, the Metropolitan
                    Opera came to town that fall. I had just arrived too. Somebody said, “The Met
                    said they could use some extras. Does anybody want to sign up?” I said, “Yeah I
                    will sign up for as many as I can do.” I found myself then on the stage of the
                    Metropolitan Opera in Aida, Carmen and Lakm�. Lilly Pons was right there
                    singing. That was a great adventure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there, did you get involved in some of the student
                        affairs. It was quite an active time you were having for students. It was
                        the National Student Association or whatever it was at the UN and
                        international, you were there. It was a new world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes. It was a new world. The UN had just gotten started. Of course we
                    students read the New York Times avidly and had bull sessions. I tried out for
                    the Harvard Crimson, but I just found out I didn't have time to do the Harvard
                    Crimson and then do my studies and then work too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the studies coming out of the life in the
                        Canal Zone? It was a good high school. Did you find yourself having to catch
                        up or did you find yourself with your classmates fairly...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Fairly. The quality I was very impressed. I had no problem at all. We had
                    excellent professors. I really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing for the University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well Roy Atherton was the librarian in our house library. Each house had
                    a beautiful library. When he graduated, left, he said, “Would you like to take
                    over as house librarian?” So I took over as the house librarian. Before I did
                    that I worked in Widner Library in the stacks making sure the books were all in
                    their right place. I did that not only for most of my undergraduate years but
                    for the two years I was over at the business school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you graduated in '49. So what did attract you to
                        the foreign service, the idea that this is...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well this goes back to the Muccio briefing. So much was going on in the
                    post war world at that time. The Cold War, the Iron Curtain, NATO being created,
                    the UN being created and all of this. So that really was my first interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we want to point out too that you and myself and
                        others sort of picking that New England boiling pot call it, were exposed to
                        the world because we had the New York Times. These were subject to debate.
                        It was a very international environment as opposed to somebody who maybe was
                        coming from the Midwest. They might have gotten it, but could have just as
                        easily not gotten it. Was there any equivalent to the campus communist
                        groups and all. Were they going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: There were. In the stairwells some evenings there was a group in Leverett
                    House. I didn't identify with them. They would sing the Internationale which
                    ended with “Freiheit” (Freedom). So I didn't know who they were, and certainly
                    nobody tried to prosthelytize me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then when you moved over to the business school. What
                        was the name of the business school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Baker. The Baker School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of courses were you taking there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well there was a core course that you had to take. You could elect if you
                    wanted to specialize. I suppose I was just interested mainly in general
                    management courses. I did take a special course in government relations. I did
                    not want to specialize in finance or something like that. But it was a wonderful
                    training session because we lived in sort of a suite, three two-person bedrooms
                    with a common room. We were each given an assignment on a Thursday evening, or
                    maybe sometimes even on a Friday. You had to then write a report as if you were
                    in a business dealing with this. Then you had to turn it in by a certain time on
                    Saturday evening. If you didn't turn it in on a certain time, they had removed
                    the container under where you put it in and you could hear the assignment hit
                    the floor. You knew that you were going to be penalized because you didn't get
                    it there on time. That turned out to be a very useful experience in the foreign
                    service because you did have to interact with all of your colleagues and then
                    you were responsible for a typed report that had to be delivered by a certain
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They used the case method then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Used the case method. Joseph R. Kennedy came and addressed us as well as
                    other business leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he viewed at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well, I don't think we knew too much about him at that time. We didn't
                    really realize how much he was taken in by Hitler and that kind of thing. But I
                    remember him starting off by saying “My generation has made a mess of things,
                    and so you have got a mess to contend with.” It turned out the implication of
                    that was I have got some sons that have lived abroad, been in embassies. They
                    will be able to help out here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the business world intrigue you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I am glad you asked that question. The other thing that was so useful to
                    me was I had to get some job during the summer. So I went over to the student
                    employment office and said, “I want to sign up for a summer job.” So they gave
                    me a list of possibilities. One of them was tutor companion. So I thought I will
                    find out about that. So the person that was interviewing me was the person named
                    William A. M. Burden. I don't know if you have ever heard of William A. M.
                    Burden. He came, his mother was a Vanderbilt and came from a very wealthy family
                    in New York. They hired me to be a tutor for their son who was about eight or
                    nine then. They had four sons by my special one was middle. They had just built
                    a fantastic home in Northeast Harbor in Maine, designed by the man who designed
                    Rockefeller Center. It was shaped like a wave. The ceiling and everything. The
                    dining table was done by Isamu Noguchi the sculptor, a huge thing like a ship.
                    So all of a sudden from being a poor boy, I was transformed into this thing. So
                    I worked for them for two summers. It said in the things, “Now don't kind
                    yourself. Jobs of tutor companion, getting a trip to Europe is extremely rare.”
                    Well the second year they decided to go to Europe. Crossed over, Queen Mary
                    first class, everything. Went to Paris and went to London. So that was my
                    introduction to Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being a tutor companion to an eight year
                        old boy. Isn't it difficult?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It wasn't with Hamilton. He was what they call a nerd now. He was
                    fascinated by the Civil War, and so he wanted to read and everything. I would
                    take him around to the battlefields in the Shenandoah and everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you went as a chauffeur with some of your
                        professors. How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That was the second year after I graduated. They wanted me to come back
                    again. I said, “Well I just couldn't.” that really was my, because both of them
                    were geographers. Subsequently after them they abolished the geography
                    department per se. But then we made a trip all through Europe. We started in the
                    Low Countries, drove all through France, all through Italy, then that was
                    it.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well we are talking about a Europe that was still pretty
                        well devastated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It was. More so the first rip that I made with the Burdens. I remember
                    when we got off at Cherbourg, I went around, while the rest of them were
                    finishing their lunch I went around and walked around town. There were large
                    stacks of coffins of soldiers still waiting to be repatriated. Then Paris, they
                    had sort of blackouts at night when most lights were either turned off or very
                    dim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was coal, the lack of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not because of war but because of post war economic
                        problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, most Western European countries faced severe problems in the
                    immediate post was period. West Germany was still occupied and had not yet
                    become a major economic factor.</p>
                <p>Of course when we got to England, they were still on rations. Ordinary Britons
                    could not obtain foreign exchange so I had no problem selling the French francs
                    I had left over from Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rations lasted in England I think until 1953...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did this getting over to Europe whet your appetite
                        some more or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes it did. I remember the ship got near Cherbourg at night and
                    everything I remember looking out the port hole and seeing the lights of all the
                    little. Soon I will be in Europe. Then one of the places we went was Alto
                    Addagie which was part of Austria but after the World War Italy had been on our
                    side, and it was turned over to Italy. Then I noticed that they were trying to
                    Italianize this completely German speaking town. I remember the Carboniere,
                    there was one blond, blue eyed Carboniere, and the other one was obviously very
                    swarthy from down near the toe of Italy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I graduated from college and all of a sudden I thought,
                        who the hell would ever listen to a guy like me tell them where to invest
                        their money you know. But anyway, you graduated I guess in '51?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. I graduated with the class of '51.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well between sessions I took the foreign service exam in the fall of or
                    the summer, I guess the fall of '50.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 3 � day exam wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, the written exam. I came down, no I took it in Boston I am sure. Of
                    course you had to wait and wait and the process started. Then I was finally told
                    I guess about a year later, no then I was called a year later for the oral exam.
                    I passed the oral exam. Then at that time I was working as a civilian employee
                    for the Department of Defense in the air targets division down at 12th and
                    Constitution in a temporary building. I worked there until my security clearance
                    came through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you recall any of the questions on the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. I had taken the precaution the summer before I took it they had a
                    course at George Washington to prepare people for it. They said, “Now one thing
                    they are keen on is your knowledge of American geography. So be prepared to be
                    able to name the states on either side of the Mississippi River.” I thought that
                    is a good thing, so boy could I name the states on either side of the
                    Mississippi River, going up, coming down. So in the middle of the oral exam they
                    said, “ Mr. Newlin, could you name the states on either side of the Mississippi
                    River.” I said, “Let's see now. Well there is Louisiana, and then there is
                    Mississippi.” I had it down pat and that gave me a certain confidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find they asked any sort of substantive questions
                        about American foreign policy or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: They didn't ask me anything on foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you took the oral exam, where were you? Had you
                        graduated from business school yet or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I guess I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a job? What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well then through happenstance I had met somebody, and they said the
                    Department of the Air Force is looking for people. This is a job of preparing
                    maps for possible bombardment in the Soviet Union. They had from the Germans
                    this great pile of photographs of sites in there. So I did that for awhile until
                    my appointment came through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come into the foreign service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I came into the foreign service on October 12, 1952. Just before our
                    class graduated they said Secretary Acheson would like to receive your class. So
                    that was one of the great thrills of our lives. This was just before the
                    administration changed, so he said this is the last class of the foreign service
                    in the Truman administration. It turned out because of the McCarthy period and
                    the new administration the foreign service didn't take anybody in for a couple
                    of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know because I came in in July of 1955, and our class
                        was class one. Because of the hiatus. You were the last class. We started
                        the cycle and it kept on. They changed the numbering but basically it kept
                        going on. What was your class like, the people in it and sort of the
                        atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Very diverse type geographically. We had just two women in our class. We
                    all got along very well together. I think we learned from each other. We tried
                    to keep in touch, but all of us now are elderly and some are not in good health.
                    But we used to have occasional reunions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the women; do you know what happened to them,
                        because this is the era where when a woman got married she had to
                        resign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It is what happened to one of them I think. She was later re-instated.
                    Then there was another one that was a lawyer form Louisiana. Bless her heart,
                    she was, I thought she was a real character, but she wasn't suited for the
                    foreign service, so she was eventually I think sort of eased out.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of some of the careers of some of your
                        foreign service class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well one of the members of our foreign service class happened to be James
                    Goodby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, very much involved with disarmament matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: And nuclear matters. He I think either resigned or took leave of absence
                    from the foreign service to go with the Atomic Energy Commission at one time. I
                    thought we would never see him again. Then Goodby will come back later on in our
                    interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well as you came in did you have any idea where you want
                        to go, and how did you play that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I wanted to go to Europe because I thought that was what my main interest
                    was. So I put that down as my first choice. Mrs. Burden gave a luncheon and
                    Cecil Lyon was there. He was then head of our mission in Berlin, at least the
                    Department of State end. So Cecil Lyon asked me would I like to come to Berlin?
                    I said, “Yes I would live to come to Berlin.” When I got to Germany and got off
                    the plane in Frankfurt, they said, “You will report to HIGHCOG in Bonn, and they
                    will determine where you will be assigned.” The Department had assigned me to
                    Munich. Then Cecil Lyon came along and said, “Would you like to come to Berlin,”
                    and that he would arrange that. So I was all keyed to go either to Berlin or
                    Munich. I said to the consul general in Frankfurt, “My assignment is in Munich.”
                    They said, “No it is not. You are going to Bonn and you meet with the personnel
                    people there and they will determine where you will go.” So I got off the train
                    and went up to HIGHCOG. They said, “You are assigned to Frankfurt. Get on the
                    train and go back to Frankfurt.” That turned out to be a very fortunate
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Frankfurt from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was there for two years. I guess it was '53 to '55. I was a rotation
                    officer so I rotated through various things. I did economic work for awhile. I
                    did administrative work. Then I did non immigrant visas and Immigrant visas.
                    While I was there I met my future wife. So that turned out to be a very
                    fortuitous assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find work in Frankfurt? By the way were you in
                        the new building?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh no, we were in Bockenheimer Anlage. It was an old high rise apartment
                    building that had been reconstructed. We looked out on the old city walls. I
                    would go out at lunch time and walk around. The entire center of Frankfurt you
                    could just see for blocks and blocks, all the way down to the cathedral. Just
                    about everything had been completely bombed. The Germans had cleaned the stones
                    and stacked them up neatly where the former buildings were. The old medieval
                    center where Goethe's house used to be was completely destroyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did a very good job of rebuilding that. I got there,
                        I was in the Air Force at Darmstadt about the time you were there. I took
                        the foreign service exam. Ended up at ICOG at EG Farben.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: E.K. Hochhaus (skyscraper).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the man who monitored the 3 � days was Kennedy
                        Schmertz. Was he, I think he was there while you were there. What sort of
                        visas, who were the people, these were non immigrant visas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I remember one applicant from the Rhineland. He looked somewhat like you.
                    He had more of a white beard. Looked a little bit like Santa Claus, and he had
                    filled out all the forms and sworn to their truth. We had access fortunately to
                    something called the Berlin document center which contained the names of Nazi
                    members. Not only his name came up but they had a picture of him. There he was
                    in uniform of the Waffen SS with the scull and cross bones cap. He turned out to
                    be the leader of a band. Even the Waffen SS had bands. I said, “You were never a
                    Nazi.” “Nein.” “You had nothing to do with the military.” “Nein.” I said, “Well
                    how do you explain this?” handing him the picture. He said, “Where on earth did
                    you get that?”</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Then one day there was a great commotion. Each applicant had to wait their turn
                    in the outer office. Then one day the receptionist who was a young and very
                    efficient German came in and said, “Baroness Von Bothmer is outside and waiting
                    to talk to you.” I said, “Well tell her to wait her turn. I will see her.” He
                    said, “Okay.” Then this lady came in dressed in a sable coat, and she had as
                    much jewelry as I have ever seen on anyone. She had been born in Ozark, Arkansas
                    in the 30's, and had gone to New York and gotten a job as a secretary in the
                    German consulate general in New York where she met Baron Von Bothmer. He
                    proposed to her, and they got married. So in those days if an American woman
                    married a foreigner, she lost her American citizenship and took her husband's.
                    In the late 1930's he was called back to Berlin, and they took the Trans
                    Siberian Railroad. They were both horrified at communism and what they saw in
                    Russia. During WWII, she made some broadcasts in English telling about the
                    horrors of communism. So when she applied earlier for a visa to go back to the
                    States to visit her relatives, her wartime broadcasts came up. The Department's
                    guidance was sought. So I got her file and it said that the Department
                    determined that she had been a foreign national doing this, and therefore there
                    was no reason to deny her a visa. She said, “Oh you must come down to the
                    Bodensee.” I never went.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for this while you were in Germany
                        about the Germans and the attitudes of the Germans at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I did not except once when I was having to have my car repaired. The
                    owner of the shop when I went to pick the car up, lectured me on how he wished
                    that the United States was dropping the atomic bomb on Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well of course, you probably ran across the phenomenon
                        that not a single German you met ever fought on the west front. They all
                        fought on the eastern front.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right. Nobody ever would admit shooting at or killing an
                    American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get up to Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, I got up to Berlin a couple of times. You had to get special
                    permission from HICOG. When you got to the Russian checkpoint when you were
                    driving the documents were stamped by the Russians. I did get to Berlin a couple
                    of times. In spite of everything it certainly had the feel of a big capital even
                    in its truncated form.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling at the time that the war could start

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, there was a fear of that. U.S. forces held well publicized
                    maneuvers. There were tensions all the time. You just never knew what kind of a
                    crisis would come up. In the Eisenhower administration we had several trips to
                    the brink.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: I got there in '53 I think it was. The end of '52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I was wondering were you there when there were

                <p>NEWLIN: That was I think later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's see, it was before, it was in '53 or '54. I
                        remember because I was at Darmstadt, and all of a sudden we were confined to
                        barracks. I was in the Air Force at the time as an enlisted man. It looked
                        quite serious.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Tell me about your wife. What was her background, and how did you meet her?</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: My wife was born near Prague, and she was at the university when the
                    Germans marched in in '39. They closed the university. In her spare time in the
                    winter, she started teaching herself English, got textbooks and a dictionary,
                    sat on the floor in her mother's room and started teaching herself English.
                    After the war, in that interim period, she went back to Charles University and
                    was studying law. When the communist coup came in '48, the students were
                    required to join the communist student union, and she refused. She had to leave
                    the university. Her father was in ill health by then and she needed a job
                    desperately, but no one wanted to hire her because she had refused to join a
                    communist organization. Somebody said, “Why don't you go and see Martin Bow.” He
                    was the American head of the allied permit office. This was an office set up
                    that had Americans, British and French officials to process Sudeten Germans
                    going to Germany. So Milena met Martin Bow. She was shocked that he interviewed
                    her with his feet up on the desk. He asked all sorts of questions and examined
                    her documents. Finally he said, “Well we don't have anything.” She said, “I am
                    so sorry, I was so hoping.” As she gathered up her papers he said, “Can you
                    start on Monday?” So she worked for the allied permit office and felt sorry for
                    the Sudeten Germans who had to immigrate. Then the communist government in 1950
                    started harassing the Czech employees of western embassies including the allied
                    permit office. It became very difficult and they didn't know what would happen.
                    She and two other girls walked across the Iron Curtain in February in the snow,
                    carrying a little suitcase, managed to make it over to the West German side. She
                    said, when somebody said, “Halt!”, she was so relieved that she had gotten
                    there. At first she had a very difficult time because she was in effect a
                    refugee and the Germans had their hands full with all of their refugees. But
                    Lawrence Steinhardt, our ambassador in Prague, contacted High commissioner
                    McCloy in Bonn and said, “Look, some of my employees feel that they have to
                    leave. If they manage to get out and they come to you, you send me their names I
                    will see if I can vouch for them.” That is what happened. While waiting for the
                    Prague embassy's clearance she worked for a British refugee agency in their zone
                    where she was so poorly paid she developed malnutrition. Finally she got word
                    that she should report to the American consulate general in Frankfurt, and she
                    was working there whenever I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Frankfurt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: In Frankfurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was she working?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: She was working in the unclassified file room. So then we got engaged
                    just as my two years were up. Then new FSOs were transferred after two years, so
                    then my two years were coming to an end. I had to apply to the Secretary of
                    State for permission to marry a non American citizen. I doubt whether it is the
                    same drill to day as it was then. You wrote one letter saying I request
                    permission to marry a non American citizen and give the particulars. The second
                    letter said, “Dear Mr. Secretary, I hereby resign from the American Foreign
                    Service as of such and such a date.” Both were sent to the Department. I went
                    away to Oslo in December '54 for my second post. Milena who had been waiting for
                    her immigrant visa immigrated to the States at the same time as I left
                    Frankfurt. She got a job at the American Geophysial Union. So in November, '55
                    we got word from the State Department that permission had been granted. That was
                    at the height of the McCarthy period and I made contingency plans in case the
                    decision was negative. I gave the State Department credit that they would clear
                    her but they took account that she had been a refugee from communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Frankfurt did you get any emanations
                        from the McCarthy period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Of course, Cohn and Schine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cohn and Schine, could you talk about who they were and

                <p>NEWLIN: Of course Roy Cohn, I guess had worked with, didn't he also work
                    with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Robert Kennedy also worked on the McCarthy staff.</hi>

                <p>NEWLIN: Bobby Kennedy, that's right. He worked there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were two nasty characters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Cohn apparently brilliant but as nasty as they come. Then he hooked up
                    with Schine whose father owned a hotel chain. They came to Bonn and they were
                    trying to root out alleged communists in the foreign service posts. One of the
                    people I think it was at the embassy in Bonn called them junketeering gumshoes.
                    A nasty bunch indeed.</p>
                <p>It was just the most terrible time in our modern history. It was a shame that
                    Eisenhower and Dulles and Senator Taft too tolerated McCarthy and his staff.
                    Somebody said to Taft, “Well this is just ruining our reputation abroad. You
                    shouldn't allow this.” He said, “Well, they are hurting the Democrats.”</p>

                        were sort of saying USIA was passing out communist propaganda. You shouldn't
                        have this book. Of course in a place like Germany where books had been
                        burned. These were two American Jews who were out censoring.</hi>

                        Washington taking the course, and while you were in Frankfurt about the
                        McCarthy period and you know, sort of the feeling of a purge that was going
                        on, or were you too low down. Did you run across anybody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No. We heard about the people who were fired or forced to resign. It made
                    you feel that the State Department and the foreign service particularly were
                    going through a very difficult time. Then there was the whole thing about who
                    lost China. And the old China hands being fired. But at that time we were all
                    just so new and everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall I was in Frankfurt, duty officer sitting in the

                        American Army officer came in and said, “Why isn't your flag at half mast?”
                        I looked at him and said, “We hadn't been ordered,” and muttered under my
                        breath, “If we had another ten feet more I would hoist it higher.” This is
                        by the time of course he had been thoroughly discredited. But it was a very
                        difficult time that I think for many people today is just ancient

                        place you are getting married. Here is the flashback about your early time.
                        You were saying, go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: My I guess he was my great grandfather, Michael Holt was a man at a town
                    in North Carolina, Saxphall, built a dam and one of the very first mills to
                    produce fabric in the south. His daughter was my paternal grandmother, Anna Fixe
                    Newlin. She was a young girl at the time of the Civil War. I remember talking to
                    her when I was a young boy in North Carolina about the Civil War. At that time
                    there was no military activities in that part over there. It was all new getting
                    started in 1861 I guess it was, '60-'61. I remember her saying she was disturbed
                    because of the flag bearers, they young men looked as though they had the flag
                    pole stuck in their navels, and that must have been. It wasn't until later they
                    explained that that wasn't the situation. At the end of the war when your
                    ancestor with Sherman showed up to blow up the dam and to burn down the mill,
                    her mother sewed the gold coins that they had in a belt, and she wore them under
                    her dress around her skirt. Fortunately the Union soldiers did not think to look
                    there. So I remember that particular incident. The family mainly had at the end
                    of the war, they mainly had confederate money which of course was immediately
                    worthless. I did remember her talking about that. I would say, “Oh Grandmother,
                    tell us about the Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, I can't remember, you got married in 1955 was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. Got married in '55.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think we did. She was a Czech refugee. She was working at the American
                    consulate general in Frankfurt. Then I had to apply for permission to get
                    married, and fortunately the State Department agreed that I could get
                    married.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: Again it was sort of a rotational job. I started out in the visa section,
                    non immigrant visas. Then I rotated into the administrative side for awhile.
                    Then finally I got my wish and got into the political section for the last year
                    and a half I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe Norway when you got there in
                        '55?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well like most places Stu, Norway in '55 was entirely different from the
                    Norway of today. They had not discovered oil then. Of course, they had been
                    occupied by the Germans during the war. The cost of living was very high. You
                    felt that you were in sort of a Nordic backwater. Certainly Oslo in those days
                    couldn't in any sense compare with either Stockholm or Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: When I got there it was L. Corrin Strong. His fortune came from the
                    Eastman Kodak Company. He was a contributor to the Eisenhower campaigns, so he
                    was a political appointee. A nicer, more congenial person you never met. His
                    wife, Alice Strong, was also very nice. Mrs. Strong was very nice to my wife and
                    told her, “Never change.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much flow back and forth between non-immigrant
                        visas and immigrant visas to the United States, between Norway and the
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes I would say that we had a fairly brisk business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, were there still issues dealing with
                        I guess you would call it the Quislings in Norway anyway, the collaborators
                        and all that. Was that much of an issue when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: That was not. You are entirely right. There were Quislings. There were
                    Nazi sympathizers, people that worked with the Germans during the occupation But
                    that had apparently been pretty well dealt with. The chief, Quisling himself I
                    think was hanged right after the war. We never had any problems of that
                    kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about were there any issues when you were the
                        political officer or even before, between the United States and Norway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, I can't say that there were. Norway has a socialist government. I
                    think there was an undercurrent of sort of pacifism. The Norwegians are the ones
                    that decide the Nobel Peace Prize while the Swedes decide the others. I was the
                    protocol officer among other things. So one of my duties was towards the end of
                    the Eisenhower administration to take a nomination, I think it was from the
                    Secretary of Agriculture over to the Nobel office proposing Eisenhower for the
                    Nobel Peace Prize. Of course he didn't get it. I remember that was my
                    introduction to one thing. They were glad to be out from under Nazi occupation
                    but I don't that there was much of a sense that they were threatened by the cold
                    war. But then before I got there, apparently the CIA or the State Department
                    informed the Norwegians that they had information that the Soviet Union intended
                    to invade the northern part where the common border is near the north cape. That
                    then caused the Norwegians, their foreign minister Halvard Lange got them to
                    join NATO. So they had joined NATO by the time I was there. But I remember while
                    I was there, at an annual meeting of the labor party, all of a sudden without
                    any warning, a group tabled a motion that nuclear weapons would not be allowed
                    in Norway. This took the leadership completely by surprise, but they didn't want
                    to have a floor fight on the thing even though they didn't agree with it. So the
                    thing passed. You will recall that Gary Powers, whenever his documents were
                    seized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the U-2 incident.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: We are talking about the U-2 incident now. Gary Powers was shot down
                    during the Eisenhower administration over Siberia and we put out a series of
                    official statements saying this was a weather plane that got lost form Peshawar,
                    Pakistan. Khrushchev went on TV and said it was an American spy plane, and we
                    have the pilot Gary Powers, alive and kicking. I had to go up north while I was
                    there to deal with some shipwrecked American seamen. One of the places where the
                    plane stopped was Bod�. It is right on the Arctic Circle. I noticed that it was
                    a very mountainous area. There was an airfield with an extraordinarily long
                    runway. A fighter jet, it wasn't a U-2, but a fighter jet landed. Then the
                    mountain opened and it went into an underground hangar. I thought well, that is
                    very sophisticated. So I was not surprised whenever it came out that Gary Powers
                    when captured had on his map that he was supposed to land in Bod�. Going forward
                    a little bit, by then our Ambassador was Frances Willis, one of the first female
                    ambassadors in the foreign service. So she was called to the foreign ministry to
                    receive an official protest. Frances Willis said Oslo was the last place where
                    she expected to be called on the carpet. The protest, of course, was for public
                    consumptiothe government and the military knew all about U-2 missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the ever the feeling that you were picking up of the
                        Norwegians that they felt under any particular threat because of their small
                        size but they did have a border with the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: They do have a border with the Soviet Union. It doesn't amount, Kirkenes
                    in the north, there is this short border in Lapland. Norwegians were the object
                    of Soviet Propaganda, because I remember every now and then it struck me, the
                    Soviets must have supplied some of the newspapers with maps of Oslo showing
                    circles what a nuclear strike on Oslo would do. The idea being to make the
                    people frightened to be in NATO. On the other hand when it was 1956, when the
                    Soviets invaded Hungary, there was a genuine reaction on the part of the
                    citizens of Oslo against the Russians for this. There was actually a big
                    demonstration down town. They marched to the Hungarian embassy and demonstrated
                    in front of it. This was unheard of, anything like this happening in Norway.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Funnily enough, on the political side, the Chinese presented us with certain
                    protocol problems. Strong had been there long enough that he became dean of the
                    diplomatic corps. One of the things the dean had to do was occasionally to
                    invite all of the heads of diplomatic missions to his residence, and they would
                    discuss any problems. Well the Chinese communists were recognized and had an
                    ambassador there. So we approached the State Department and said he has got to
                    have this meeting. We see no option other than to invite the Chinese to come to
                    the American ambassador's residence, because this is the way it is done here..
                    So the state department agonized over this and came back and said, “Well your
                    role is to promote good relations with the Norwegians. Therefore for protocol
                    reasons, you should invite them. So one of my duties, among the duties of a
                    young foreign service officer, was to stand at the door, and when the Chinese
                    ambassador and his entourage, I did not shake hands with them. I simply said
                    welcome and then ushered them in. While I was there, King Haakon died. He was
                    their first modern king. They were in the process of trying to create a
                    Norwegian identity. He was born, I think in Windsor Castle. His name had
                    originally been Charles, but he changed it to a Norwegian Haakon. During the war
                    he and his family took refuge in the UK. When he died, the new king had to have
                    a great big state funeral. After the funeral, the palace of course gave a
                    luncheon for all of the dignitaries that were there. It turned out that Corrin
                    Strong was seated next to the Chinese ambassador, and he took this very badly.
                    He protested to the foreign ministry. “You know very well we don't have
                    relations etc., etc.” The Norwegians said, “According to protocol, Corrin was
                    the dean , the Chinese was next and so on.” That was royal protocol.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had a socialist government there, the Eisenhower
                        administration which was moderately right wing Republican. Was there a

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I mean during the cold war, where ever you were, the cold war was
                    dominating. I think we were comfortable with the socialist government, and the
                    socialist government was glad to have the United States and the protection NATO
                    provided.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I must say this sounds incredible, but the Germans who had been there as
                    soldiers would come back to Norway on vacation. They would go to the houses that
                    they had occupied. The owners had been kicked out. They would knock on the door
                    and say, “I was a German soldier and I lived here during the war.” Well this was
                    not received very well.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: No, I don't remember that the Soviets did play very much of a role. They
                    kept sort of low key as far as I could tell.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviets at that time, were they sending submarines up

                <p>NEWLIN: Oh well as usual you know, they had been under the Swedes for a long
                    time. At one time they were under the Swedes or they were under the Danes. The
                    problems were in the summertime, the Swedes would all drive over to see the
                    fjords and the Norwegians resented the fact that they would bring all of their
                    food and beverages with them. They called them the cheap Swedish tourists. There
                    was not any love lost there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well we were reporting on their various activities. There was sort of a
                    peace movement. Oh who was the famous man that was an organist he was in
                    Africa?</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Albert Schweitzer had sort of a peace movement that came along. People
                    were supposed to sign up for his program. It was sort of a peace at any price
                    kind of thing. One thing we had to do was report as to how many Norwegians were
                    supporting Schweitzer and his peace program. Linus Pauling, the famous American
                    Nobel prize winner and also a pacifist came to Norway. One thing I had to do was
                    go listen to his lecture. He was a very congenial person. He wasn't sort of a
                    raging person at all. These were the two pacifist movements which did have a
                    certain amount of public support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was life in Norway? How did you and your wife enjoy

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: We enjoyed it mainly because of the Norwegians, because they were so
                    friendly. I can say that it was a very nice post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to travel around much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: We did. We took a boat and went all the way up to the north cape, all the
                    way up to Kirkiness and saw the whole thing. We would then go up to the fjord
                    country. We tried to learn to ski. I was not a very good skier. We had good
                    Norwegian friends. We really enjoyed the spectacular country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in 1958, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: In 1958, as I said, we got married in '55. My wife, Milena, came to
                    Norway and was with me for the last two years. In '58 we were transferred to the
                    State Department. The idea being that since I had married a foreign national,
                    that we should be in Washington so that my wife could become more Americanized.
                    So Frances Willis, then the career ambassador, she wanted me, I found out later,
                    I didn't know, she wanted me to be assigned as the Norwegian desk officer. But
                    the European bureau had their own candidate so that didn't happen. But because
                    she had made the request, I was assigned as a political officer to the Bureau of
                    International Organizations. The office was called UNP (United Nations Political
                    Affairs). The heads of the office were William Cargo and Joseph John Sisco. That
                    turned out to be a very interesting place to be at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before I get to that, you mentioned that the parliament
                        had passed the no nuclear weapons in Norway. Did that...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: That wasn't the parliament. That was a Labor Party Congress. I might not
                    have made that clear. However, since the government was socialist it had the
                    effect of law. Oh well there were the sensitivities, I am glad you mentioned
                    that. The political section could have good access to practically all of the
                    senior people in the labor movement, the Labor Party. One of my colleagues asked
                    for one of his Norwegian friends, “Can I come and just sit in on the Congress to
                    really see how these things go?” The friend said, “Yeah, come on.” Then some of
                    the delegates, I guess they were not friendly toward the United States, made a
                    big issue in the newspapers. One headline said the Americans wish to censor
                    Norwegian politics. They tried to send a political officer to participate in our
                    Labor Party congress. So this was something of an embarrassment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then we will move back. It became a United Nations
                        affair. You were doing that from '58 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I did that from '58 until '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a good five years. Well first will you talk about
                        Bill Cargo and then about Joe Sisco. Particularly Sisco is renowned . But
                        first let's talk a little bit about Cargo, and then we will talk about
                        Sisco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well both men worked very closely together. Bill Cargo predated Sisco in
                    the Department. He was involved I think along with some of the others in the top
                    secret planning during WWII for the UN, so we wouldn't have another debacle like
                    we did after the First World War when we did not join the League of Nations.
                    Sisco I think started out in CIA and I suppose Joe couldn't stand not telling
                    people where he worked or what he did. So he transferred to State and was
                    Cargo's deputy. As a result of this he was not accepted by the old foreign
                    service crowd as a genuine FSO that had come in the front door through the
                    examination procedure. I got along with them very well. My immediate boss was
                    Elizabeth Ann Brown. She, I think too, had done some of the planning during the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had been involved with the United Nations for a long
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew her when she was the chief of the political section
                        in Athens when I was consul general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Ah-ha.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I started out working on general political things, whatever came up
                    that Sisco would assign me. I had a minor role in the cold war. After the Soviet
                    invasion of Hungary in '57, I thought up a gimmick to use in the UN that in the
                    credentials committee, we would not accept the credentials of the soviet puppet
                    Hungarian regime. I knew that it would be a major fight to reject the
                    credentials and we probably would have some defections, but if we took no action
                    on the Hungarian credentials, then this would cast a shadow on the Soviet
                    installed communist regime. I remember there were various views in the
                    Department. Sisco and Cargo were both for it, as was the IO (International
                    Affairs) assistant secretary. I remember that the assistant secretary for Far
                    Eastern Affairs, Mr. Robertson, whose mission in life was to protect Chiang
                    Kai-shek and the Chinese Nationalists. It finally got all the way up to Dulles'
                    office. So I found myself with Sisco going into Dulles' office. Robertson was
                    there, and Robertson was worried that this would set a precedent, and maybe the
                    soviets then would say we ought to take no action on the Chinese credentials. So
                    we had quite a debate. Finally, Dulles agreed that this is what we would do. So
                    for years, this went on. We always lined up a majority vote in the committee. I
                    know that it annoyed the Soviets because at one stage Khrushchev complained
                    publicly. He said, “This is something intolerable, and it is a rat in the throat
                    of the United States, the capitalists.” I started out in UNP in the old State
                    Department Building. The new State Department Building was just being finished,
                    and so it wasn't long that we moved into the present building. By that time, the
                    Kennedy Administration had come in and there were great changes all around. I by
                    that time, had been made officer in charge of dependent area affairs which in
                    colonial times had been headed by a very senior officer who ran it as his
                    fiefdom. Now this was on the eve of all of the colonial entities becoming
                    independent. So I got involved in all of that. Rwanda and Burundi, and even then
                    I remember there were tensions between the Hutu and the Tutsis, and what was
                    going to happen when the Belgians suddenly left. Then there was a serious
                    problem with West New Guinea, which was then known in Indonesia as West Irian.
                    The Dutch when they granted independence to Indonesia, which they had to do
                    after the war, had left this one remaining part out. So the Dutch still occupied
                    West Irian. They had never done anything there. The indigenous people were a
                    fascinating thing for anthropologists to study because they were stone age
                    people. No roads, No schools, no hospitals, but still. So Sukarno the first
                    president vowed to reunite West Irian. In the early ;60s there was a political
                    tidal wave of post colonial leaders. You had Nehru in India. You had Nkrumah in
                    Ghana. You had Nasser in Egypt and Sukarno in Indonesia. You had Tito in the non
                    aligned movement. This became a political issue in the Netherlands. Sukarno took
                    over Dutch businesses and expelled Dutch businessmen. The Dutch said the problem
                    should be solved through negotiations and the administration backed them up. I
                    was involved in all of these discussions. Then U Thant of Burma had become the
                    Secretary General of the UN. We worked out an arrangement whereby Ellsworth
                    Bunker would be designated by U Thant as his representative, and he would invite
                    the Dutch and the Indonesians to meet to discuss the future of this. This was
                    really my introduction to the important international negotiations. Ellsworth
                    then had two State Department aides. I was one, and there was a fellow foreign
                    service officer from the Far East Bureau who was the Indonesian desk officer. We
                    met secretly in a plantation near Middleburg owned by a Texas millionaire. It
                    was a plantation house built in colonial times, well staffed, beautiful grounds
                    and everything. The Indonesian ambassador, Malik, was very capable. The Dutch
                    team were too. Bunker did a very good job. My job, and the job of the other
                    foreign service officer was to take notes of the meetings and make sure to
                    inform the Department of what was going on. We found that there was quite a bit
                    of agreement as to what should really happen, that finally the future should be
                    determined by some kind of form of consulting the people whether they wanted to
                    join Indonesia or not. There should be an interim UN administration of the area
                    prior to the actual consultation. We had gotten quite along when the Dutch said,
                    “I think we ought to draw up a piece of paper saying what we agree on.” Bunker
                    said, “Yes. Mike, will you draw up this piece of paper.” So I drew up a list of
                    all the things that had been agreed on, and so that was the core of what became
                    the basic agreement. Even though the talks were going well Sukarno behaved badly
                    and kept issuing threats. Suddenly it looked like we wouldn't have any
                    agreement. The negotiations adjourned. Then the foreign minister of Indonesia
                    came to Washington, and Kennedy received him. Later on when Jim Bell, who was
                    the office director for Indonesia went to get debriefed, the foreign minister
                    said, “This is the first time as foreign minister that I have ever been
                    threatened.” Kennedy said to him, “You have got to settle this thing
                    diplomatically, and I want to let you know that if you try to use military
                    force, the seventh fleet is in the area.” That broke the ice, so we then
                    reconvened, got the treaty done, went up to New York and got U Thant's blessing
                    and the Security Council. In addition to drawing up the draft that became the
                    basic treaty with minor changes, the other thing that I did was I put in a
                    provision that the cost of the UN administration, the interim administration,
                    would be borne jointly by the parties, because I didn't want this to get hung up
                    by people who didn't like the agreement for some reason in the non-aligned or
                    elsewhere., to hold it up in the UN budget committee and that kind of thing.
                    There were people in the State Department who said, “No, we can't have that kind
                    of thing. This is a UN undertaking and the UN ought to pay for it.” I stuck to
                    my guns. I said, “This is trying to facilitate UN approval.” So this was one of
                    the successes of the Kennedy Administration. It wasn't very widely noticed, but
                    we did have the interim administration. Bunker went out and was in Jakarta.
                    Eventually they had something called mujawara a consultation of the local
                    people. During the negotiations we would occasionally have to have a day or two
                    of no activity while the two parties got instructions. This was certainly true
                    of the Indonesians, and the Dutch too. Afterwards, Hydecooper came to see me in
                    the Department later and said, “Mike, I want you to know that we had no
                    instructions. Lunz the foreign minister said to the Dutch ambassador, 'you go
                    and settle this thing.'" Later on unfortunately he was criticized by some of the
                    political parties for having succeeded. The West Irian settlement resulted in
                    normal relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. Dutch businesses
                    returned.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: That's true.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: They spent no money at all. But a very nice thing happened to me as a
                    result of all of this. Can you imagine a young foreign service officer getting
                    something like this?</p>
                <p>Q: I am going to read it in here. This is from The Secretary of State August 28,
                    1962. Dear Mr. Newlin, The successful conclusion of the West New Guinea
                    negotiations owes a great deal to a small group of State Department officers
                    being both directly involved. I know the long hours and the hard work you have
                    devoted to this enterprise, and want to express my personal thanks to you for
                    your outstanding service to your country over those past months. Sincerely, Dean
                    Rusk</p>
                <p>That is great. Not many secretaries do that. What was your impression of how
                    Ellsworth Bunker operated?</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Ellsworth Bunker, if you were in Hollywood, and you wanted somebody to
                    play the role of a Boston Brahmin exuding dignity and integrity, you would send
                    for Ellsworth Bunker. His silver hair and delightful person. It turned out that
                    he and his family were Dutch immigrants. He had worked in the Jack Frost sugar
                    company and was a successful businessman. I think he married a very wealthy
                    wife, and he had served as ambassador to India, I believe, as well. He was
                    superb. He was firm when he needed to be firm, but he was always approachable,
                    and I was very fond of Ellsworth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the negotiating teams of the Indonesians
                        and the Dutch? To me it sounds like although they had lived together for 300
                        years, I can't think of particularly a rebel group that came out not that
                        long before in Indonesia I can't think of sort of the stolid Dutch and the
                        rather excitable Indonesians. I mean how did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I think one of the things that worked was the fact that Ellsworth
                    was in charge of it. I was very impressed with the Indonesian ambassador Malik
                    and the Dutch team was also first rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later he was foreign minister wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think he did go on to be foreign minister. He was a very modest person,
                    soft spoken, very pleasant. Spoke perfect Dutch like many of the Indonesians.
                    The Dutch team had two very senior ambassadors. After the day's negotiations, we
                    had morning sessions, and then we would break for lunch and afternoon sessions.
                    After dinner we would all gather in the living room of this beautiful plantation
                    house and just talk. Then when the Dutch and the Indonesians wanted to compare
                    notes and didn't want the Americans to know what they were talking about, they
                    would speak Dutch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have the equivalent to a representative from
                        one of the deep valleys of New Guinea come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, they wouldn't have known what it was all about. If I could go fast
                    forward a little bit, all this was now in the Kennedy Administration, and of
                    course we had a new assistant secretary of state in Harlan Cleveland. Harlan was
                    a brilliant creative person, very ambitious, and made it clear that he was going
                    to carry out the program of the Kennedy Administration. We had our own dependent
                    areas in the islands in the Pacific. We had put them after the war under the
                    Security Council because we had a veto there. They were a UN trusteeship, but we
                    administered them. A tribal chief from Samoa came to Washington and called on
                    Cleveland. We hadn't done anything really to help develop the place. People
                    fished and ate coconuts. That was their life and that was fine. Cleveland
                    thought they should agitate for some infrastructure, schools, and so forth. So
                    he kept trying to tell the chief that he had to get busy in a lobbying effort in
                    Congress. The chief didn't understand so Harlan said, “The squeaking wheel gets
                    the grease.” Finally when it was explained to him, he said, “Well, we believe in
                    people being modest and not too greedy.” The chief didn't understand the
                    squeaking wheel analogy.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The most exciting thing that happened while I was in UNP was the Cuban missile
                    crisis. Some of us were called in on a Saturday afternoon. Sisco wanted to know
                    where, we had a young man named White, where his files were. So we had to go and
                    find his safe and files. We were then dismissed.. We surmised it is either Cuba
                    or he was working on Honduras. Well it turned out of course it was Cuba. So when
                    we finally got to the denouement of this big Security Council meeting with Adlai
                    there, Cleveland was of course on top of all of the things. He said, “The OAS
                    (Organization of American States) is meeting this afternoon.” We had a
                    resolution there condemning the installation of the missiles in Cuba, calling on
                    the Soviets to remove them. Cleveland sent a member of our United National
                    political affairs over to be at the OAS for the vote. We were all in Cleveland's
                    office that evening glued to the television. The telephone rang and it was JFK.
                    He said, “Harlan, the OAS just voted in our favor unanimously except for Cuba..
                    We have got to get this up to New York right away.” So Cleveland said, “Mr.
                    President, if you will look at your TV screen, you will see Joe Sisco handing a
                    note to Adlai with the vote.” Now I call that completed staff work. If there
                    ever was completed staff work that was it. One of the big advantages I remember
                    is I got to go up to New York for brief periods and then also I got to go up for
                    one whole assembly. For some reason I had items that Adlai was interested in,
                    and so to show you what a wonderful person he was.</p>

                    appreciation for the outstanding work done by Michael Newlin during the resumed
                    session of the 15th General Assembly. I worked closely with Mr. Newlin when the
                    Assembly was considering the Cuban question and had the opportunity to observe
                    his performance firsthand. Without the experience and good judgment of such
                    officers as Mr. Newlin our task at the resumed session would have been well nigh
                    impossible. I came away from the session with a renewed pride in the quality and
                    devotion of the people who work in the State Department and the foreign service.
                    Sincerely yours, Adlai Stevenson.</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That shows you what kind of person Adlai was. He was wonderful</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did you get any feel for Joe Sisco and his
                        bureaucratic skills. He was considered probably one of the preeminent
                        bureaucratic fighters within certainly the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh he was absolutely superb. He was just great. I learned a lot from Joe.
                    We had a very good relationship. Another thing that I was involved in was I
                    guess this was the apartheid issue. This was a big agenda item for the non
                    aligned.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in South Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: South Africa. I drafted a speech for Ambassador Plimpton. He was the
                    deputy permanent representative at that time at the UN. I drafted a speech in
                    which I said that the United States abhors apartheid. So Cleveland and Sisco
                    thought that was just right, that we ought to say this. Of course there were
                    other voices with all of the secret security things we had going with South
                    Africa, didn't want to say this. Finally it got up to Dean Rusk who approved. On
                    the future of Angola, I drafted a speech which said, “governments derive their
                    just powers from the consent of the governed.”</p>
                <p>The European bureau objected on the ground that we should not upset our NATO ally
                    Portugal. Cleveland cleared the speech remarking that it had already been
                    cleared by a Secretary of State named Jefferson. The times were so different
                    then. You did not have the vast bureaucracies in the White House and elsewhere.
                    There were recurrent crises with the Soviets. One involved the Russian demand
                    that we lower the tailgates of our trucks before transiting the Soviet zone on
                    the way to Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far should we open the tailgates. You know there was a
                        vast theology about the rights. All of these were quite important because
                        the Soviets were diddling away at them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes. Absolutely. Also nibbling away. Martin Hillenbrand was the German
                    desk officer. His phone rang, it was President Kennedy. He said, “Martin, don't
                    get me into World War III over tailgates.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In know because I was in INR during part of this period.
                        When I would call somebody and they would say who is speaking. I would say
                        this is Mr. Kennedy. You would get this very long pause at the end. I would
                        quickly add, “I am with the State Department. My name is Charles
                        Kennedy.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I used to go in on Saturdays and just review the intakes so I would be up
                    to speed by Monday. The duty officer at UNP that day was Bob White. He was by
                    that time in public affairs. The phone rang and the caller said, “This is
                    Secretary Dulles.” “Yes Mr. Secretary.” Dulles said, “I see in the New York
                    Times that Henry Cabot Lodge is going to give a speech at Dartmouth today on
                    disarmament.” “Yes Mr. Secretary.” Dulles said, “Have you seen this speech?”
                    “Yes Mr. Secretary, I saw the speech.” “How would you describe it?” Bob said,
                    “Lackluster.” There was a silence and then the Secretary said, “Fine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know maybe it was later but did you have any feeling
                        about an anti UN feeling in Congress, sort of right wing or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Not in those days because the UN still even with the influx of the 60
                    newly independent states we were the dominant power. In the General Assembly we
                    could usually get through what we wanted. Dulles invented something that later I
                    guess could have come back to haunt us. When the Soviets would of course keep
                    vetoing anything to do with the cold war in the Security Council, even though we
                    had the majority of votes. Dulles came up with the uniting for peace resolution
                    whereby, if the Security Council could not act on something because of a veto
                    you could take it to the General Assembly and get it voted on there. Of course
                    it didn't have the binding character of something by the Security Council, but
                    demonstrated a majority view. The UN was deeply involved in the Arab Israeli
                    dispute, We had Ralph Bunche in the Secretariat in New York. We had to pay for
                    all of the Palestinian refugee costs because the rest of the UN said this is
                    your problem. You created Israel so therefore you have to pay for the upkeep of
                    the refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that being assigned to the UN at that time was
                        really quite exciting for a young officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh very. Very exciting. You were there, I remember I was up there when
                    the time U Thant was running for Secretary General. That was an interesting
                    thing too that we were involved in later. But I am getting ahead of myself
                    whenever I was assigned to the UN. But I happened to be up there at the UN when
                    U Thant called a news conference in one of the halls. He said, “I have the
                    impression that my candidacy is acceptable to all members of the Security
                    Council.” So that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the Kennedy assassination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, I will come to that when I get to Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how did you find the United Nations it was called
                        what International Organizations in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: IO, The Bureau of International Organizations Affairs. We covered many of
                    the international organizations, but not NATO or the economic ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again here is where somebody with the skill of Joe Sisco,
                        I would think that there would, the United Nations covers all sorts of
                        issues, but the various geographic bureaus feel they have it is their
                        birthright.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Here come the interlopers.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so you must have been seeing a significant number of
                        bureaucratic issues didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, there were frequent Bureaucratic clashes. I mentioned the problems
                    caused for the European powers by the sudden independence of their former
                    colonies. The founding of Israel created new tensions in an already volatile
                    Middle East. The USSR's support for communist insurgents in Latin America were a
                    major headache. In South Asia the U.S. supported Pakistan whereas Russia
                    supported India. I fortunately was chosen by Sisco to be UNP's go between with
                    EUR. The European Bureau was the one we had most of our problems with. Cleveland
                    got the idea that we would take the Berlin situation up in the Security council.
                    (I thought this was a bad idea indeed, but I was not consulted.) At the
                    beginning of the Kennedy administration Dean Acheson was invited back to the
                    State Department as an advisor to Dean Rusk. Cleveland had discussed the plan in
                    a meeting with Acheson and Rusk. The EUR bureau had not been present so the
                    draft telegram to New York needed the clearance of the assistant secretary of
                    European affairs. I remember it was late in the afternoon. After I cleared it
                    with Acheson, Sisco sent me over to EUR. When I handed it over the assistant
                    secretary immediately called in his deputy and said, “Look at this.” Finally he
                    said, “I cannot clear this, these waters are dark and turgid.” So I went back
                    and I said, “No sale.” Fortunately EUR managed to kill the idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I talked to people who were in Berlin at the time the
                        Kennedy administration came in, and they were quite concerned because they
                        had things like the tailgate and all. They thought that the Kennedy
                        administration might be very soft on Berlin and might give away the store
                        because there had been talk before they came in, during the election about
                        some flexibility. Of course when you get to the situation as tight as
                        Berlin, flexibility would mean flexibility on one side and not on the
                        other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Some years later Khrushchev told Rusk that he had talked to many West
                    European leaders and all of them said they were not prepared to fight if the
                    Soviets took West Berlin. Rusk replied, “Well, you much recon with the fact that
                    the Americans would be foolish enough to do so. Perhaps it was during the Cuban
                    Missile Crisis, Khrushchev was asked during a press conference if he believed
                    the U.S. was a paper tiger. He replied, “Maybe so, but the tiger has
                    thermonuclear teeth.”</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Incidentally, I do have something I think I should add about the origins of the
                    Cuban Missile Crisis, because this happened years later when I was on a mission
                    to Moscow. It was at a luncheon and the Russian that I was sitting next to had
                    been an aide to Khrushchev. They were down I think in Yalta. The subject came up
                    of American intercontinental ballistic missiles in Turkey right across the Black
                    Sea. Just maybe less than 200 miles, Minuteman. My luncheon companion who was
                    there said Khrushchev declared, “Well if the Americans have nuclear missiles
                    that close to the soviet Union, then I want Nuclear missiles in Cuba close to
                    the United States.” That was when he gave orders to do that. As a result of the
                    Cuban Missile Crisis, the Russians removed their missiles from Cuba. Secretly
                    Kennedy committed to remove our missiles from Turkey which was done after a
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I think this is probably a good place to stop. We will
                        pick this up in 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Let's pick it up in 1963 because that is when my tour wound up, and I
                    will have one thing to say next time to say about the end of my stay in the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that pertain to so we won't forget?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: An intelligence matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay we will pick that up then and then we will move on to
                        Paris, is that okay? Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is 25 October 2006. Mike you were in IO was it?</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was in IO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to say something about an intelligence
                        matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. First I might say a word about onward assignments. It was difficult
                    for people in IO at that time because the geographic bureaus had a great deal of
                    say in the personnel system. In the personnel system you were supposed to be
                    available to go anywhere. In IO we didn't have any posts under our control
                    except New York and Geneva. So when it came time for my tour to be up I applied
                    to EUR for a post. I kept getting rebuffed because EUR had its own candidates.
                    Then a friend of mine who had worked with me in IO, and had wound up at our NATO
                    mission in Paris came by to say hello. He was, even though he was a junior
                    officer, he was very close to Thomas Finletter who was our permanent
                    representative there. He happened to be with Finletter on consultation in the
                    Department. I said, “Do you have any jobs coming open in mission in Paris?” He
                    replied, “Yes, Mike, as a matter of fact we do. Would you be interested in
                    working on political-military affairs in the political section?” I said, “I
                    would love it.” He said, “I will go over and talk to Finletter.” He went over
                    and came back and said, “Finletter says come on over and meet him.” I met him.
                    Finletter said, “I understand you would like to come to Paris?” So that was how
                    that was done.So I was about ready to go off then. In those days of course it
                    was the height of the cold war. The only Eastern Europeans we could have any
                    sort of contact with were the Yugoslavs because Tito had broken with the Soviet
                    Union. Milena and I got very friendly with a Yugoslav diplomat and his wife. I
                    think they had a child with them too. They weren't like the Soviets were, you
                    had to leave somebody behind. After awhile, I think it was over lunch, he
                    indicated that he was an intelligence officer and that he wanted to defect. So I
                    said, “Well I assume you have given this a lot of thought. It is a major step.”
                    So I then went back to the Department, and I went over to EUR and talked to the
                    Yugoslav desk officer. He said, “Well we have to tell the FBI right away.” The
                    next thing the FBI got in touch with me. One evening, I picked up an FBI agent
                    in my car and then I drove around to a place the Yugoslav and I had agreed. The
                    Yugoslav got in. The FBI agent said, “I understand you want to defect?” He said,
                    “Yes I do.” The FBI said, “Well what proof do you have that you are what you say
                    you are?” So the man produced a copy of a recent classified telegram from the
                    State Department. So it turned out that it was a legitimate thing and my
                    Yugoslav friend and his family defected. Then pretty soon after that I was off
                    to Paris. I am told that later there was a message from J. Edgar Hoover to
                    Dulles complementing me on this event. Then some time considerably later, here
                    is a message from the deputy undersecretary of state for administration.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, this is dated November 2, 1965. Dear Mr. Newlin, It has been brought to
                    my attention that through your alert response to a situation in May, 1962, the
                    Federal Bureau of Investigation was able to conduct a successful operation
                    dealing with Yugoslav intelligence matters. I am referring to your reporting of
                    a conversation with a representative of the Yugoslavian embassy, Washington DC,
                    and your evaluation of this individual. I wish to commend you for your
                    alertness, your professional handling of this delicate situation. A copy of this
                    memorandum is being placed in your official personnel file. Sincerely yours,
                    William J. Crockett. Well very good.</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: All right, off to Paris.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: I was in Paris, oh something funny. Personnel developed sort of hiccups
                    over this assignment because it was all handled outside regular personnel
                    procedures. But finally when they got the word that Finletter agreed, they did
                    not want to second-guess him. Eventually Personnel called me and said, “Mike we
                    are ready to write your assignment orders to Paris. We are in the process of
                    trying to save money, so we are going to assign you to Paris for five years to
                    save money of transferring you after four. Is that agreeable to you?” I said,
                    “Yes that sounds all right.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you owe me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I said, “Yes.” So that was where we were. We were going off then in 1963
                    at that time for five years presumably. In those days most people traveled to
                    Europe by ship. So we were supposed to go on an American ship, the old America.
                    While we were docked in New York and people were waving goodbye, I could look
                    down and see that the crew was leaving the ship. A spokesman made a public
                    announcement, “There is a slight difficulty with a dispute with some members of
                    the crew, but we will soon be at sea. We advise the people on the dock to
                    disperse, and we will soon be at sea.” Well the America never sailed again. The
                    upshot of it was three days later we went over three docks and sailed on the old
                    Queen Mary. That was a very nice introduction to our thing in Europe. We were
                    met in Paris by the head of the political section, John Auchincloss. It was a
                    very interesting assignment indeed. Finletter of course, had been Secretary of
                    the Air Force under Truman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thomas K. Finletter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, Thomas K. Finletter. He and Eleanor Roosevelt were with Adlai
                    Stevenson the very liberal wing of the Democratic party. The deputy chief of
                    mission was a very interesting fellow called Durbrow. I don't know if you have
                    ever heard of Durbrow, but he was a cold warrior if there ever was one. Anybody
                    that he disagreed with, he call a goddam UN loving twilight sleeping son of a
                    bitch. 'Twilight sleeping' in those days were narcotics given women in labor. I
                    had the impression Durbrow used the phrase rather than comsymp or comdupe. Since
                    I came from IO, I was under somewhat of a suspicion, and since my wife was born
                    in Czechoslovakia, even though she had risked everything fleeing communism he
                    always sort of regarded her with some misgiving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what was sort of the political
                        situation in France vis a vis NATO, I mean at the time you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: At the time we arrived, it didn't really come to a head so much, but de
                    Gaulle was very much on his campaign to increase France's role in the world and
                    independence. Actually while I was there, the NATO mission was really the focus
                    of a lot of activity in that regard. When I first got there in '63 it was not
                    so. I will say right after we got there, just a few weeks after we got there,
                    the Auchinclosses invited us for dinner. The had a beautiful place on the Champs
                    de Mars. When my wife and I got there, the people taking our coats told us in
                    French, “Kennedy is dead.” We were just stunned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: November 22.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: November 22, yes. So we went in, and they had the radio on, so during the
                    entire evening we were listening to the radio as to what was happening in
                    Houston and Washington. That was a tremendous shock.</p>
                <p>Under Finletter, we had at that time I arrived a project called the multilateral
                    force. I don't know whether you have ever heard of that. This was a scheme to
                    associate the West Germans with nuclear weapons so that they could defend
                    themselves in case of a Soviet attack. The ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic
                    missiles) would be on surface vessels that looked like merchant ships. The
                    United States would control the nuclear missiles but they would be on ships that
                    you could move around. Of course this is something that would drive the Soviet
                    crazy. Finletter was just hell bent on this idea. The minister for political
                    affairs was Phil Farley. He had reservations and said Finletter sounded like the
                    ancient mariner in his dedication to the multilateral force. The French and
                    perhaps some other delegations were not going to have any part of this, but
                    still we spent a lot of time on that.</p>
                <p>It became apparent that political life in Paris was divided into segments between
                    the twice a year de Gaulle press conferences. Three months leading up to his
                    press conference there were all these rumors and speculations about what he was
                    going to say. The press conference would take place and for the next three
                    months everybody was speculating as to what some of his oracular statements
                    meant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to ask you. What did you do. Was your focus
                        on sort of the French association to NATO or was it you know were you
                        looking at the Germans and other people there? How did you go about doing
                        what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Okay when I got there, the political military thing was really sort of
                    the State Department interaction with the American military presence which of
                    course, was very large indeed. SACEUR was just outside of Paris. We had air
                    bases and other military facilities as well as large related infrastructure such
                    as pipelines. So I was involved with sort of liaison with the military from a
                    political standpoint. Once we got an instruction from Washington that instructed
                    the mission to go and see SACEUR, who was General Lemnitzer, and persuade
                    General Lemnitzer to involve himself in the Cyprus dispute since other efforts
                    to solve the Cyprus problem had been to no avail. So Finletter gave me the
                    telegram, told me to go out and see Lemnitzer, and carry out the instruction. So
                    I got in a car and went out and after a great deal of security and questioning
                    got in to see Lemnitzer. I showed him the telegram. “This is what Washington
                    would like you to do.” It had been cleared by the Pentagon. Lemnitzer looked at
                    me and said, “These are the God Damnedest instructions I have ever seen. I am
                    not about to get involved in the Cyprus dispute.” So I said, “I will report
                    back. If you would like to call Ambassador Finletter, please feel free to do
                    so.” I went back, and Finletter and Mrs. Finletter were waiting for me at his
                    residence, I reported, “Absolutely no sale on that.”</p>
                <p>I got involved in other things such as the NATO infrastructure program as well.
                    The alliance decided to build an integrated radar program to shield Western
                    Europe. It was very expensive and at the time no European firm was capable of
                    taking on such a huge undertaking. At the end, the contract went to Hughes. We
                    were very close to the Germans and assured them we were working on the
                    multilateral force. Then however, Kennedy's death changed everything when LBJ
                    became president. Finletter decided he had better go off to Washington and try
                    to ingratiate himself with LBJ and bring LBJ up to speed as to where the
                    multilateral force thing stood. Somehow he managed to get a rather small meeting
                    with just LBJ and a few people in the oval office. While LBJ was a master of
                    American politics, he had had little experience in international affairs. So LBJ
                    agreed that yes, Finletter should go right ahead, full steam ahead and work with
                    other delegations and broaden the effort and so forth. Finletter came back very
                    much encouraged. But I thought to my self, well, I wonder about those in
                    Washington and elsewhere who have doubts about this project. I mean even though
                    LBJ gave him his blessing to mount a major diplomatic campaign on this, I just
                    wondered about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I guess I had been in Paris 18 months or so, my wife one morning at breakfast
                    came in with the Herald Tribune, and said, “Finletter is out and he is being
                    replaced by Harlan Cleveland.” Of course I had worked very closely with Harlan
                    in IO before coming out. So that meant that Durbrow was out too. The first thing
                    that happened was that Harlan's personal political advisor, Tom Wilson, who was
                    not a foreign service officer, but was soon assigned to the mission came out on
                    reconnaissance. I briefed him about the whole situation. Finletter and Durbrow
                    were out. The third ranking person was Phil Farley, who was a brilliant person
                    but rather prickly. In the Department he had been in what was then pol-mil. He
                    had made a lot of enemies in the Department because of his very strong views,
                    including making an enemy of Cleveland. So when I got to work that morning at
                    the elevator downstairs Phil Farley said, “Well I am looking for another job. I
                    am not going to work for Harlan Cleveland.” I said, “Now Phil calm down. Harlan
                    Cleveland is one of the most intelligent and creative people I have ever worked
                    with. With you as his deputy here, we would have it intellectually over all the
                    other delegations.” Then I made the same point to Tom Wilson when he came out. I
                    said, “Don't let Harlan fire Phil Farley without meeting and talking to him. I
                    think it would be good.” Fortunately this was the way it finally worked out. By
                    that time when Harlan came, de Gaulle had really begun his anti NATO campaign.
                    He had decided that he didn't want to go so far as to kick the North Atlantic
                    Council which was composed of ambassadors of almost all European countries, he
                    didn't want to go that far. But he decided he would kick out SACEUthe military
                    headquarters. There were a number of ambassadors on the North Atlantic Council,
                    who said, “This is all right. The military HQ can go to Germany or Belgium, and
                    the North Atlantic council would stay here. Well if the North Atlantic Council
                    was supposed to manage crises and the military was off in another country, that
                    wasn't going to work. Some Ambassadors didn't want to leave their beautiful
                    homes in Paris. So at any rate it was finally decided that we would have to go
                    to Belgium where NATO was welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well up to this point two things. One, in the first place,
                        this multilateral force with these ICBMs and all on ships. I mean it never
                        happened, but how did it strike you? It must have been a nervousness about
                        this because...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: There was a nervousness about it. At first I thought it was a good idea
                    because it would reassure the Germans presumably. That is what it was meant to
                    do. It would reassure the Germans and dampen any future thought that they ought
                    to try to develop nuclear weapons themselves. But I did see that it possibly had
                    quite a bit of security problems associated with it. On the other hand it would
                    certainly complicate the strategic planning of Moscow because they would
                    certainly make every effort to find out which ships these things were on and
                    where they were stationed and where they were going. These would be surface
                    ships made to look like merchant craft. Of course there would be security
                    problems both at sea and if the were allowed to dock along with regular merchant
                    ships. I have already mentioned what the Norwegian reaction would be. While I
                    worked on the project loyally with Finletter since it was his main interest, I
                    wasn't too sorry to see the thing evaporate after LBJ came in, and particularly
                    when Finletter left, the thing died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have any contact with the French military or
                        the French civilians dealing with the French military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I did not. My main military contacts were with the American military, and
                    planning for their departure and all the problems associated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it was huge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: We had air bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had supply lines running through France.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, we had a big pipeline running from Cherbourg or Le Havre running
                    through France to supply the oil and gasoline that we used in Germany. George
                    Ball sent a telegram saying that we wanted ironclad assurances from the French
                    that that pipeline would not be touched. I remember the Ambassador to France at
                    that time was Chip Bohlen. We were at dinner when this came up. He said,
                    “Ironclad jock straps? Where are you going to get anything like that?” Finally
                    we had to face the fact that both the North Atlantic Council and the military
                    were going to Belgium. The Belgians were marvelous. They managed to put up in
                    six months or less a new headquarters for NATO in a suburb of Brussels plus
                    building headquarters for SACEUR and all of the military further away down near
                    the French border. So at that time, that was in '67 I guess it was. Personnel
                    said to me, “Well Mike, you have been in Paris for four years and you are
                    assigned for five. What do you want to do? Do you want to just say you are
                    though with NATO or do you want to finish out and go to Brussels for one year?”
                    I thought it would be interesting to see how this works out, so I said I would
                    like to go on to Brussels. So we packed up and went off to Brussels for the
                    fifth year of our assignment.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well while you were dealing with the American military
                        there, and working with our ambassador...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This is tape 3, side 1 with Michael Newlin. Mike, Go back when you arrived. What
                    was Finletter's, and maybe the American military you were talking to attitude
                    towards one, the French and two de Gaulle at that time, and how did things
                    evolve?</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was rather shocked when Finletter mentioned General Norstad who
                    was...SACEUR when I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lauris Norstad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, he was SACEUR. Just after I got there he announced his retirement
                    and left. Then Dirk Sticker, a Dutchman, was secretary general of the North
                    Atlantic Council. So I remember Finletter remarked when Norstad left, he said,
                    “Well that is one down.” Then he wanted very much to have Sticker replaced
                    because Sticker was not always easy to follow the American line. On one occasion
                    Sticker was so furious over the U.S. position he grabbed a piece of paper and
                    wrote, “Dear Dean, I resign. Dirk Sticker.” He had his aide, an American, take
                    the paper down to Finletter who managed to assuage him. However, Sticker was
                    soon replaced by an Italian and relations improved. Lemnitzer played his cards
                    differently and wanted to maintain as much professional contact with his French
                    colleagues as he could. The French still had their delegation in the North
                    Atlantic Council. I remember before Lemnitzer left that de Gaulle received him
                    with full military honors to give him the Legion d'Honneur and embraced him. A
                    sort of soldier to soldier goodbye..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did, I mean I am trying to get the attitude of
                        both our civilian delegation to NATO and our military, the people you were

                        Gaulle. I mean was there a lot of bitterness, anti Frenchness or anti de
                        Gaullism or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I didn't pick that up from the military. I guess they figured well this
                    is what is going to happen. We have got to live with it. The only thing is they
                    did drag their feet in closing some of the facilities. There was one facility
                    particularly not too far from Paris that kept dangling. They were missing
                    deadlines. I kept harassing them on that. I said, “Look, you have moved
                    practically everything else.” It turned out this was the golf course.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Well this is always the, I mean in the Philippines
                        I understand the golf course was the last thing to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Before NATO left, Cleveland went around saying that de Gaulle's policies
                    being followed were accelerating the irrelevance of France in world affairs.
                    Well this didn't go down well with Couve de Mourville, the foreign minister. I
                    am told that at a diplomatic reception, Couve De Mourville saw Harlan Cleveland
                    and he wouldn't speak to him.</p>
                <p>Of course, I should mention that about midway through in the Johnson
                    administration, we began to have the looming quagmire of Vietnam. JFK sent the
                    first U.S. military advisors to Vietnam but when LBJ became president the
                    situation had deteriorated to the point where McNamara and the joint chiefs were
                    pressing for combat forces. LBJ, I had the definite impression, had initial
                    reservations about this escalation. If you recall there was a big conference of
                    wise men, Acheson, McCloy, Walt Rostow at the White House and all of them bought
                    into the domino theory, that you cannot let Vietnam fall. So I remember somebody
                    coming back to Paris and telling Cleveland that LBJ was having his doubts about
                    all of this, and he wanted others to participate in his decision on Vietnam
                    whether to go for a massive build up of our military. Cleveland said, “He can't
                    have anybody else. He has got to make the decision himself.” Cleveland was all
                    for the Vietnam thing. After we got into Vietnam and after things began to go
                    sour, and it turned out not to be a cake walk by any means.</p>
                <p>The NATO ambassadors in addition to meeting in the North Atlantic Council which
                    was a formal thing, they would have a luncheon, a private luncheon with just
                    ambassadors present every so often, I think once a month. Cleveland wanted very
                    much to lobby them, all of his counterparts to really support us on Vietnam.
                    Since I had worked for Cleveland before in the Department, whenever he would go
                    back to Washington on consultation, he would take me along. I would arrange all
                    of his meetings. I remember one in Katzenbach's office. Katzenbach was I think
                    in effect the deputy secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point he may...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Cleveland said, “I want to lash the other NATO members to the American
                    chariot. I want the go ahead to start that.” Katzenbach looked at him and said,
                    “I don't think you can do it.” I remember Foy Kohler coming out, and this was
                    towards the end of my assignment. We had lunch with Cleveland and a few other
                    people from the mission. Foy Kohler said, “You have to understand that every
                    morning when the president wakes up, his first thought is how do we get out of
                    Vietnam?” Cleveland would come back from his consultations in Washington and
                    say, “Well, we must be doing things all right. I got no complaints whatsoever.”
                    The fact of the matter was that everybody was so preoccupied with Vietnam that
                    we were not high on the agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well during this time, '63 to '68 that you were involved
                        in NATO, how did we view the Soviet threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well the Soviet threat was a serious matter and that was the glue that
                    held NATO together certainly. Everybody believed the United States would
                    certainly live up to its obligations under the NATO treaty to see to it that the
                    Soviet Union did not encroach into Western Europe. There was that underlying
                    belief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left I guess before September of '68 when the Soviets
                        went into Czechoslovakia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. We had left by that time. That was a chilling thing too, but there
                    was a great reliance on the nuclear deterrent of the United States. Oh I am
                    forgetting something. It is quite relevant here, which is everybody was relying,
                    particularly the Germans, on the American deterrent. McNamara decided, he was
                    Secretary of Defense, that he ought to educate the Europeans on just what
                    nuclear war consisted of and what decisions you would have to make. So he formed
                    in NATO, the NATO Nuclear Planning Group. It was my job within the mission to
                    work with McNamara and his staff whenever he would come. We had to have Q
                    clearances and all sorts of other clearances. What he was doing was showing that
                    if you did have a Soviet thrust into Western Germany, and you decided to respond
                    with tactical nuclear weapons, he said, “Yes you would kill the advancing
                    Soviets, but in so doing you would kill an awful lot of your own people, and
                    plus the fact that you would be getting hit with Soviet nuclear weapons.” So we
                    had maps showing the area of destruction nuclear weapons would cause. I found
                    out later sometime later, that our strategy was with the tactical nuclear
                    weapons in Germany in the event of a Soviet attack we would turn them over to
                    the Germans and let them make their decision just what they would do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during this time you were there, how large did
                        Berlin loom in your radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: When we were there, that was not a major thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it is often, I know by my own experience, I served
                        in that type of situation. All of us who were looking at it were thinking
                        Berlin is the place where World War Three might start.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, that is certainly true. Khrushchev was unwise enough to try to cow
                    us. He presumably told Rusk, “I have talked to all of the European heads of
                    state, heads of government, and not one of them would go to war if we took over
                    West Berlin.” Presumably Rusk said, “Well Mr. Chairman, you just have to
                    consider the fact that the United States just might be crazy enough to do that.”
                    Then at one of the crises, I don't know just which one. It may have been the
                    Czechoslovak crisis, presumably Khrushchev was asked at a press conference if he
                    thought America was a paper tiger. “You have to remember that the paper tiger
                    has thermo nuclear teeth.” So there was with all of its dangers and everything,
                    there was a balance. The balance of what was MAD, Mutually Assured
                    Destruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife at all concerned or involved at all in the
                        Prague Spring and all coming to Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh she was very much indeed. She was just so hopeful when Dubcek came in
                    and with the freedom of speech and assembly reforms. Then she was very
                    distressed over the Soviet invasion and the reimposition of communist rule. It
                    is interesting that Gorbachev knew Dubcek and that they discussed socialism with
                    human faces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in 1968, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was sitting in my office in Brussels and the telephone rang. It was Joe
                    Sisco. Sisco then I guess, had become undersecretary for political affairs. He
                    said, “Mike, I am putting Bill Buffum on the line, and you listen to Bill and
                    agree to what he says.” Bill Buffum was then our deputy ambassador to the UN in
                    New York under George Ball. So I said, “Okay Joe, I'll listen.” Buffum came on
                    the phone and said, “Mike the head of our political section here is up for
                    transfer, and Joe and I want you to come to New York to be head of the political
                    section.” I said, “Oh wow, well I will have to talk to Milena about that.” I
                    knew she wouldn't be too thrilled about going to New York. I said, “I will let
                    you know.” So I then called him back and said, “Yes I will do it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>So off we went to New York. In those days you got no housing allowance. You got
                    practically no representational allowance. You were just a government employee
                    working in New York, but you were working in this place called the UN dealing
                    with all these other delegations and the UN Secretariat. My predecessor, Don
                    Toussaint, his wife didn't want to live in Manhattan, so they lived in New
                    Rochelle. It was not infrequent to have a late night security council meeting or
                    if you had a crisis in the general assembly and it broke up at midnight or
                    sometimes later. It wasn't worth his while to go down to Grand Central Station
                    to get the train to New Rochelle. He would no sooner get home than he would have
                    to get the train to come back. So he would sleep in the little health unit we
                    had there. I said to Bill Buffum, “I am not going to do that.” So they then
                    started looking around to see what they could do. Buffum asked George Ball to
                    intervene with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (he knew the company's
                    president) so we could live in Peter Cooper Village on the lower east side.
                    Ball's intervention caused a great improvement in Peter Cooper's personal
                    attitude. That was easy for me to come up First Avenue and late nights were
                    manageable.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>By the time I arrived Charles Yost had become permanent representative. I was
                    amazed that Nixon had chosen a career foreign service officer for a cabinet
                    level post that usually had been filled by well-known political figures close to
                    the White House. It was wonderful working with Yost. He was one of the great
                    figures of the foreign service and was an expert o the soviet Union and Eastern
                    Europe. He was at the Potsdam conference in 1945. There was a picture of him
                    sitting right behind Truman flanked with Stalin on one side and with Churchill
                    on the other. Yost, of course, knew all of the political issues and how the
                    Department worked. It was very easy working with him. He needed practically no
                    great input from the political section. We just carried out his instructions on
                    what he wanted to do. Yost was very considerate. He asked me one day, “I have
                    been invited by the navy to go down on one of our Trident submarines for a
                    launch. Would you like to go too?” I was delighted. So we flew down to Florida,
                    got on the Trident, went out. I then saw really what a nuclear submarine was and
                    the problems you had to solve. Submerged we launched an ICBM 2,000 miles
                    downstream. Then again once he said, “I have been invited to go down to Cape
                    Kennedy for a space launch. I can't go. Would you like to go?” So I got in on
                    that amazing earth-shaking experience. It was at a Security council meeting in
                    1970 when our public affairs officer came over and said, “There is a rumor that
                    Yost is leaving and he is going to be replaced by Moynihan.” I said, “Oh dear
                    that isn't so good.” That turned out to be a trial balloon that didn't float. A
                    few weeks later he came over and said the next rumor was, “Yost is leaving. He
                    will be replaced by a defeated Texas politician named Bush.” So I said, “I am
                    getting out of here. I am not working for a defeated Texas politician.” He said,
                    “Now hold on a minute. He is not a typical Texas politician, so you just hold
                    your horses.” So I did. I didn't say anything to the Department or anything. The
                    mission is configured on the corner of 45th Street just across from the UN. A
                    big meeting room is up on the top floor. The ambassadors are on the next floor.
                    The next floor is the political section. We had between the ambassadorial and
                    political section floors spiral stairs you could go up when you were in a hurry.
                    I charged up the stairs on my way to Yost's office one day. A group of people
                    were standing around that I didn't know. One of them came over and said, “I'm
                    George Bush.” I said, “I'm Mike Newlin.” He said, “Oh, Mike Newlin. They told me
                    in Washington I should look you up. Do you have a few minutes Mike?” I said,
                    “Yes. Let's go in this office here.” George Bush said, “Now Mike, I don't know a
                    great deal about the UN. I don't have a great background in foreign affairs. I
                    need your support and the help of your colleagues.” He then said, “On the other
                    hand, I have political contacts with people I think can help us here in the
                    United States with what we are doing with foreign policy.” Of course we were
                    soon eating out of his hand. He was wonderful. He was fantastic.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: The counselor for political and security affairs is the principal officer
                    in the UN mission below ambassadorial rank, responsible for the achievement of
                    U.S. political objectives in the United Nations. As this position is presently
                    constituted, the incumbent performs dual functions. Either of which could be a
                    full time assignment. The incumbent's primary role is principal political
                    advisor on both substance and tactics to the chief of mission and his two
                    ambassadorial level deputies. Less visible but of near equal importance are his
                    executive responsibilities as head of the political section consisting of 12
                    officers and 6 secretaries. In the first role the incumbent must keep abreast of
                    a world wide range of political issues either before or apt to come before the
                    UN. He must prepare or supervise the preparation of briefing papers for meetings
                    between the chief of mission and permanent representatives of 131 other
                    countries, the Secretary General of the UN and other important officials often
                    at the foreign minister level. Normally he participates in such meetings and
                    prepares reporting telegrams, or supervises a member of the political section
                    doing so. The incumbent has overall responsibility for staff work in UN
                    political bodies, the Security Council, the General Assembly, and the two
                    political committees, the Trusteeship Council and the Committee on De
                    Colonization and non self governing territories.</p>

                <p>I wound up being George Bush's chief political officer from the State Department.
                    We worked closely on a daily basis. The issues that we faced were many and
                    numerous. Among them of course, was the second India-Pakistan war. But before
                    that there was the great issue of Chinese representation. When I got there, that
                    was beginning to heat up. We for years and years ever since Chiang Kai-shek was
                    defeated and left for Taiwan, we supported the Nationalist Chinese, even though
                    they were not on the mainland of China. Then just before the issue came to a
                    head in the UN, we adopted what amounted to in effect a sort of a modified two
                    China policy. We wanted to keep our options open to eventually establish
                    relations with the People's Republic of China. We said that we had a one China
                    policy. We said that we recognize that China was one entity, but that there was
                    a special situation with regard to Taiwan, and we thought that even though China
                    should represent the Chinese people in the UN, there ought to be representation
                    for Taiwan as well. The ultimate status of Taiwan should be decided through
                    negotiations. We engaged in a massive worldwide diplomatic campaign for our new
                    policy. The problem was that Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists didn't support
                    the new policy. They weren't in favor of it. The Soviets at that time did not
                    want to have the PRC in the UN; their relations with Beijing were terrible. Even
                    though that they didn't want to have the PRC in they couldn't very well campaign
                    against them. So George bush was very active in meeting with supporters and
                    getting reassurances that yes when the votes came they were with us. The lineup
                    was complicated. The UK and Canada recognized the PRC. Japan supported us
                    strongly and also mounted a worldwide diplomatic campaign. The nonaligned were
                    aligned against us. We had a wonderful officer in the political section who was
                    a marvelous vote analyzer. On paper, we had a majority of commitments but some
                    of the were soft. Her bottom estimate was that we would lose.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>It was about maybe a week before all of this was coming up in the General
                    Assembly and George Bush summoned me to come up, just the two of us. He said,
                    “Mike, I am going to tell you something in the strictest confidence that you are
                    not to tell anyone.” He said, “Kissinger is going to Beijing to meet with the
                    Chinese.” This was just before the vote. I said, “Well, we are going to lose,
                    but nobody can blame you that we are going to lose.” He said, “No I don't
                    believe that at all. We have got firm commitments for a majority, many at the
                    chief of state level. I then went over the opinion of our vote counter whom Bush
                    knew was usually accurate. So then I put together a telegram, a top secret NODIS
                    telegram to the Department that said this is coming up to a vote in a few days.
                    Here are the numbers of states that have said yes they will vote yes. Here are
                    those that are going to abstain. Here are those voting no. We think that when
                    push comes to shove, that we are going to lose and here is our guess as to the
                    final vote. So I took it over to the Waldorf Towers to show George. He said, “I
                    don't like this at all.” I said, “Well I think you ought to at least tell the
                    brass in Washington this is our best guess so that it won't come as a shock to
                    them if it turns out to be accurate. Hopefully people will do what they say they
                    are going to do, but we don't know.” So he reluctantly agreed to sent it. So
                    then Rogers, the Secretary of State wanted to send his aide, Dick Pedersen who
                    used to have the job that I had, up to reinforce us. George was wonderful about
                    it. He called me in and said, “Washington wants to send Dick Pedersen up here,
                    Mike, for the Chinese vote.” I said, “He is welcome. By all means let then send
                    Pedersen and anybody else they want to come up here.” So Dick came up. In the
                    midst of this really historic meeting in the General Assembly which dragged on
                    into the night. George was summoned to the telephone to get a call from
                    Kissinger in Beijing. He never told me what went on but I think it wasn't a very
                    pleasant thing. Kissinger was obviously very nervous about how things were going
                    to turn out. Sure enough we did lose. We went through a period...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Kissinger visit been announced at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes. It had been announced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So everybody was drawing the conclusions that the game is
                        over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. Why should we ruin our future relations with China when Kissinger is
                    meeting Mao? That is how it came out. We had to go down to Washington, went down
                    to Washington with George. We met with Scali and the media and briefed them as
                    to what had actually happened. Long standing allies, the Netherlands, Belgium,
                    Tunisia joined the stampede.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>So then the Chinese did arrive. The Chinese ambassador in Ottawa was told to pack
                    up and come to New York and assume his duties there. I don't think the Chinese
                    were really expecting it. I will tell you another very interesting thing that
                    happened. All of this was going on and we were lobbying the quarters. I went
                    over and tried to persuade the Dutch to stand with us and the Tunisians that had
                    promised. They were hell bent to vote for Beijing. The Albanians were the
                    sponsors of the resolution that replaced the Nationalist Chinese with the PRC.
                    So during the meeting it looked like and we were lobbying so much that it looked
                    like that we were going to prevail again in defeating the Albanian resolution.
                    So the Albanian representative got up and started towards the podium. The
                    Pakistani permanent representative Aga Shahi said, “Where are you going?” The
                    Albanian said, “Well I am going up to the podium. I am withdrawing my
                    resolution.” Shahi said, “Why are you doing that?” “I am afraid we are going to
                    lose.” “You are crazy; the Americans are losing. Don't do that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, Mike, Before you heard about Kissinger going to
                        China which obviously pulled the rug out from everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It changed everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But before you heard about that, was there sort of the
                        feeling OK we are fighting this battle, and we fought this battle year after
                        year after year to keep the PRC out of the UN. Was there the feeling that OK
                        we are doing this one more year, but this is really a losing battle to go on
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well, Nixon's overture took everyone by surprise. His entire career had
                    been built on strong anti-communism. We assumed that we would again prevail with
                    the support of anti-communist members. Things got off on the wrong foot that
                    night from the beginning. The roll call is decided by lot. You pick out a
                    country name to begin and then proceed alphabetically and the first member to
                    vote that night was Canada. So the Canadians voted against our position. Of
                    course the UK were against our position as well. So this was a losing
                    proposition.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I think they were probably surprised they won. They came in and we couldn't have
                    any official contact with them, but there was a political officer, Harry Thayer
                    in the political section who spoke Chinese, so he was the one that went with the
                    customs and immigration people to assist the Chinese delegation when they
                    arrived. Then George Bush wanted very much to meet the Chinese permanent
                    representative. So I said, “OK, we will arrange that.” So I found out when Kwong
                    Hua was going to call on the president of the General Assembly. His office was
                    right behind the podium of the General Assembly so I arranged for George Bush to
                    appear to be making a telephone call on the telephone right outside the door. So
                    when Kwong Hua came out, I said, “Mr. Ambassador, I would like you to meet
                    Ambassador Bush of the United States.” They shook hands. That was George Bush's
                    first official contact. Of course they were in the Security Council. It was a
                    pretty dicey thing. At one stage there was a debate, I guess this must have been
                    in the context of the second India-Pakistan war. Of course the Soviet...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of the Bangladesh war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The Bangladesh war, that's right.. And of course the Soviets were
                    supporting India. The Chinese were strongly supporting Pakistan. George Bush got
                    a call from the Department instructing him to call U Thant, the Secretary
                    General and urge U Thant to call for an immediate cease fire between the two. So
                    he did get U Thant on the line, and U Thant was very dubious that this was
                    something he ought to do. I broke in and said, “People are dying. This is
                    something that the UN should do.” He said no, that he really didn't think the
                    situation was one that he could take this initiative. So we reported that back
                    to Washington. Then we got word of a telegram from Islamabad saying that the
                    U.S. could call for a cease fire. The State Department shot back and said, “Do
                    you formally request the United States to call for a cease fire?” Then the
                    answer came back,. “Yes. We formally ask the United States.” So then we issued
                    the call for a cease fire. It came into being. Then we had a Security Council
                    meeting the next day to bless the outcome of the war and say that Bangladesh was
                    independent. Bhutto, by that time was president. It was very interesting. I went
                    with George over to the hotel to meet with Bhutto. He was an interesting
                    character because he had been very anti American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh he was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. But he was very smooth and everything. Then in the Security Council
                    meeting the next day, he denounced the resolution that provided for Bangladeshi
                    independence and for the cease fire and the negotiations. He ripped up the
                    resolution and threw it into the Security Council well. He had had many harsh
                    things to say about India and about a lot of people. Then Bhutto got up and
                    walked out of the Security Council. Then later in the afternoon I saw him
                    walking in the hall outside arm and arm with the foreign minister of India.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have a problem during this time because there
                        was the famous thing with Kissinger was tilting towards Pakistan and sent I
                        think the Enterprise, the aircraft carrier task force into the Bay of Bengal
                        and all. Did that cause problems in the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No. Things were moving so fast and everything. It was clear there was
                    going to be a war between India and Pakistan. Bangladesh, they were all in favor
                    of leaving Pakistan. They were a majority. People said this is what is going to
                    happen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That was later. George Bush was such a, to show you what sort of person
                    he is. He met with the Israeli permanent representative. The Israeli
                    representative said, “Have you ever been to Israel?” George Bush immediately
                    said, “No I haven't been to Israel, Ireland or Italy. I haven't been in national
                    politics before.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The three I's. What about was the issue of Puerto Rico,
                        were these things, I mean the idea that Puerto Rico should be
                        independent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: On my watch that did not surface. That had been asserted in Truman's time
                    and that sort of thing when they shot up Congress. That didn't come up. I am
                    trying to think of, just look here and see what else. The India Pakistan war.
                    The Security Council debates on India and Pakistan coincided in part with the
                    climactic assembly consideration of the Middle East producing one of the most
                    hectic periods in UN history. “Due to this conjunction of items, Newlin on
                    several occasions represented the U.S. with foreign minister Eban of Israel. The
                    resolution finally adopted by the assembly was one on which the U.S. was able to
                    abstain thereby achieving the major American objective of preserving our middle
                    man role in the Arab Israeli dispute.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are quoting from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I am quoting from an efficiency report.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was the issue in the Arab Israeli in the UN on

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I forget exactly what it was. It was a resolution in the General Assembly
                    which was one sided. It was critical of Israel but did not mention there were
                    Arab states involved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find, I am trying to capture the period of
                        time, where we have often been accused of being in the pocket of the Jewish
                        lobby. Did you find that to be the case at this time or it sounds like we
                        were struggling to maintain a middle position so we could be
                        influential.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. In those days we did. We did strive to be, and we did have
                    credibility at that time. Of course the Jewish constituents in particularly New
                    York were very vocal. We did have the ability at that time to be seen as someone
                    genuinely trying to work towards a peaceful solution It was the basic Security
                    Council resolution, which I guess Joe Sisco was largely responsible for, that
                    did call for Israeli withdrawal from the west bank and Gaza in exchange for
                    negotiations on the status of Jerusalem, which was left hanging, and for
                    Palestinian recognition of Israel. That was our position and we maintained
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression maybe of Bush and others who were
                        involved with at the UN of U Thant as the Secretary General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well that had all taken place of course, prior to his arrival. U Thant I
                    think was a reasonable Secretary General. That had all come to a head when I was
                    in the department of State and I would go up to the General Assembly on
                    temporary duty. I was there when Hammarskj�ld's plane crashed. We were suddenly
                    faced with having to find a new Secretary General. It was thought at that time
                    that it was Asia's turn. We needed somebody that was from sort of a neutral
                    country that would be acceptable to everybody. Early soundings revealed “The
                    Burmese representative, U Thant.” Then the word came from Washington,
                    “Absolutely not. We cannot have anybody as secretary general from a country that
                    has a common border with the PRC.” I happened to be walking through the halls
                    when U Thant called an impromptu press conference in the hall and said, “I have
                    the impression that my candidacy meets with approval of all of the members of
                    the Security Council.” Well that was it.</p>
                <p>Later when I was stationed in New York Sisco came up as the head of a delegation
                    that came up to meet with U Thant to urge U Thant to occupy himself with the
                    middle east situation that was at a deadlock. Sisco urged U Thant to start with
                    Jerusalem. The idea being that if you start with Jerusalem and solved Jerusalem,
                    that everything else would follow.. So U Thant, Ralph Bunche was there and Brian
                    Urquhart. So U Thant said well he would think it over. U Thant decided that was
                    a non starter, so that didn't get anywhere. Previously, the assumption had been
                    Jerusalem, being the most difficult issue, would come last after the West Bank,
                    Gaza, the Golan Heights and refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was your impression of the UN in those days?
                        This is '68 to '72.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, the UN played an important role in international affairs, as was
                    shown by the Security Council meetings on the India Pakistan war and on other
                    things, to say nothing of the Chinese representation issue. Washington paid
                    attention as to what went on there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about George Bush's, I am talking abut Herbert Walker
                        Bush, has a reputation of being a very good person person. In other words
                        getting out and meeting people. How did you find he operated in the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Superbly. The first thing he did when he got there, he said, “Mike I want
                    to go and call on the heads of other delegations.” I couldn't imagine Henry
                    Cabot Lodge or Goldberg going out and making introductory calls on other
                    delegations. I remember we made the rounds. The representative of Lebanon
                    couldn't believe the American representative wanted to come and call on him? As
                    a politician he was very good. He would always get on the phone first. Whenever
                    he would call, he would get on the line first. He was genuinely liked. He was
                    very supportive of the staff. We would do anything. The hours were long, and the
                    issues were difficult. People were terribly loyal to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, well I think just looking at the time this is a good
                        place to stop here. We will pick this up, if you have anything to talk about
                        that occurred to you later about the UN you could do it. But otherwise where
                        did you go after in '72?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well as a result of while I was there, George Bush and the security
                    council decided to have a meeting outside of UN headquarters. Since Africa was
                    so important in those days, we met in Addis Ababa of all places. After the Addis
                    session he got permission to go on a tour of certain African countries. I went
                    with him. One of them was Kinshasa, the former Belgian Congo renamed Zaire. When
                    my tour was up, George Bush tried to help me get an onward assignment. As a
                    result I wound up being deputy chief of mission in Kinshasa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok we will pick this up in '72 when you are off to
                        Kinshasa as DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is 17 November 2006. Mike you were saying you had some recollections, so go
                    ahead with recollecting.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well these, fortunately are brief. I thought I had better mention one
                    thing that I did not discuss last time which was the election of Waldheim as
                    Secretary General. While I was there, U Thant's term came to an end. We started
                    out looking for a new Secretary General. Our candidate was a diplomat, a very
                    distinguished diplomat from Finland named Jacobson. Jacobson told us that
                    Secretary of State Rogers had told him that he was going to be the next
                    secretary general, that he was our candidate and “The United States will veto
                    all other candidates until he is accepted by the Security council and
                    recommended to the General Assembly. So we worked very closely with the Finnish
                    delegation, and Jacobson made his rounds. He would report back to us that he had
                    gone and talked to so and so, and they had no objection to his candidacy. That
                    struck me as odd that he never seemed to have people saying you are our
                    candidate too. I asked the Finnish DCM what about the Russians? He said, “Well
                    you don't understand that the Russians could never veto in modern times a Finn.”
                    Well when we got to the denouement in the Security Council, then he had several
                    vetoes. Waldheim also had several vetoes including the United States and the
                    British. We were teamed up with the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not Waldheim but the Finn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: So after we had this deadlock it was clear Jacobson did not have the
                    votes, there were some Europeans that were vetoing him too. So there was a US-UK
                    summit meeting in the Bahamas over a weekend. Rogers and the British foreign
                    secretary agreed that we would support Waldheim. The Europeans coalesced behind
                    Waldheim. We did all the security background checks and Waldheim said yes that
                    he had served in the Wehrmacht in WWII, but that he was on the Russian front and
                    had been wounded, and came back and went into law. It only came out later that
                    yes he was in the Wehrmacht, but he was in Yugoslavia and he served as an
                    intelligence officer. Whether the Israelis or the Yugoslavs really knew about
                    this we had no idea, but it didn't come to light. So Waldheim was then elected.
                    I will have to say that I do not think he turned out to be a very effective
                    Secretary General. It is interesting that the truth about his military service
                    did not come out while he was Secretary General of the UN. After his term was up
                    he was elected president of Austria. While I was deputy assistant secretary in
                    consular affairs (1985-1988) the Justice Department learned the real story and
                    started proceedings to deny him admission to the U.S. under war criminal
                    statutes. I went to a meeting of Justice where Waldheim's lawyer was seeking a
                    hearing. The Justice lawyers were not inclined to agree. I said in such a matter
                    Waldheim should be allowed to defend himself before such a drastic step was
                    taken. A hearing was held and Waldheim was put on the watch list. This meant
                    that senior U.S. officials could not meet with him in Vienna for the remainder
                    of his term as president. In my view, his crime was in the cover-up and there
                    was no credible evidence that he was a genuine war criminal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up anything as to why Jacobson was not an
                        acceptable person?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: No I really couldn't tell. I don't know whether Rogers knew about this in
                    advance. Mrs. Jacobson was very active. She was Jewish and she was very active
                    in Jewish organizations such as Hadassah. Whether that had played any role or
                    not I don't know. But Jacobson was certainly well qualified and he certainly
                    would have been a better Secretary General than Waldheim. Another thing, this is
                    in the anecdote department. George Bush with his background was also a member of
                    something in New York called the links club. That is where a lot of the captains
                    of industry met. So one day Bush said, “I would like to have lunch with the
                    Russian ambassador, Malik. I think we will go to the links club.” I said, “Oh I
                    think that is a great idea.” I went with him. When we were having drinks
                    beforehand I said to Malik, “Mr. Ambassador, You are now in the very heart of
                    capitalism. The Links Club is a haven for CEOs and millionaires.” Instead of
                    taking it lightly, Malik sort of got red in the face and said, “We Bolsheviks
                    are not afraid to go anywhere.” So I didn't succeed in a light moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK well you are off to Kinshasa. You were there from when
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I am off to Kinshasa. I was there from '72 to '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a good long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Three years. I figured it was time for me to have a hardship post since I
                    have had most of my other tours either in Washington, New York or in Europe. It
                    taught me a lesson that is useful and that is that one should not personalize,
                    if you can avoid it, negatively personalize this officials that you may have to
                    work with later. Because when I was in the United Nations affairs in the
                    Department and I was in charge of dependent area affairs, people in African
                    countries and others becoming independent, we had a great deal of difficulty at
                    that time with Rwanda and Burundi with the Tutsi and Hutu and the Belgians were
                    dying just to cut and run and get out. We wanted to make sure there wouldn't be
                    an outbreak of sectarian violence. Sheldon Vance at that time was the head of
                    the Central African area of the African bureau. We had a great deal of
                    difficulty, I had a great deal of difficulty with Sheldon Vance. Clearing
                    telegrams with him was difficult. Sheldon Vance happened to be the ambassador
                    that I was later going to be working for. It turned out while he was there Tasca
                    was the assistant secretary. Tasca fired Vance because Vance adopted what I
                    thought was a very reasonable position on an issue for once, and Tasca fired
                    him. So I filed that away, Vance can't be all that bad if Tasca fired him. So it
                    turned out that we had a very wonderful working relationship. He told me when I
                    first got to Kinshasa, “Mike the way I believe this should work is you should
                    know everything that I know. When I am gone, you will be in charge, and when I
                    come back I am not going to try to second guess any decisions that you made.” He
                    lived up to that. At that time I mentioned before how pervasive, and this is
                    something that you would really have to live through, the cold war was. Mobutu
                    was basically put into power by the CIA at the time that the Belgians panicked
                    and pulled out in '61. There were only two Congolese then that had any
                    significant training under the Belgians. One was Mobutu who was a sergeant in
                    charge of Congolese troops and the other was Lumumba who was in the mail
                    department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A postal worker or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: In the competition for who was going to take over as president of this
                    new country, it turned out that the CIA and the United States decided to support
                    Mobutu, who was a charismatic personality with political ability. But the regime
                    was pretty corrupt. We had diamonds there in addition to the copper and other
                    resources. The diamonds would be flown in and they would then just be flown off
                    to Belgium for Mobutu's account. His relatives, all of the food, most of it for
                    us had to come in from outside, and a relative of his was in charge of food
                    imports. You can imagine the possibility for kickbacks and stuff like that. And
                    his relatives were salted as well as close cronies. Sheldon gave Mobutu credit,
                    more credit than I thought he deserved, for being a sort of honorable steward of
                    the country. On the other hand, during the time that we were there, the country
                    did stay together, this vast country with all of its ethnic diversity and huge
                    natural resources. You could travel freely. I traveled all around the entire
                    country and no problems whatsoever. When it came to our attention that some of
                    his relatives were involved in some egregious activity, Sheldon in one of his
                    one-on-one meetings with Mobutu would say, “Mr. President. Can I speak to you as
                    a friend?” Mobutu would always say, “Mais oui, mais oui.” Sheldon would say, “We
                    have indications that this is going on.” Mobutu would say, “Oh well I will have
                    to look into that.”</p>
                <p>But Sheldon and I and his wife, Jean, and my wife, we were very close and we had
                    a very good working relationship. That lasted about two years.</p>
                <p>Then we had Deane Hinton, he had been working I guess, on economic things here in
                    Washington. Deane was a different kettle of fish. Before he came everybody said
                    how brilliant he was. I guess economically he was certainly brilliant. He also
                    must have learned from his experience in Zaire politically because he went on to
                    be ambassador in Nicaragua and I think, Panama as well. Deane was not suited to
                    be an ambassador in Africa. I will have to say. He told me once, he said, “Mike,
                    I don't know how you tell them apart. They all look the same to me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Latin American hand mainly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He was a Latin American hand. He had been in Chile, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Central America.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, that was his beat. So he managed to get on the wrong side of Mobutu
                    in the final year that I was there. He didn't ask me, but he called for his
                    Lincoln Continental official car, and drove off to the center of Kinshasa where
                    the Congolese population was, called Lecit�, to call on the Cardinal, Cardinal
                    Molongo at that time, who was not a friend of Mobutu. Mobutu took this very
                    badly. So it wasn't too long after that that an article appeared in a Belgian
                    paper called Jeune Afrique (Young Africa). The headline read, “Deane Hinton, our
                    man in Kinshasa,” Picking up on the Graham Greene book “Our Man in Havana.” It
                    was in a staff meeting when the public affairs officer came in and said, “Have
                    you seen the latest edition of Jeune Afrique?” So Deane looked at the article
                    and said, “Oh that is nothing. We don't have to report this.” I said, “Oh yes we
                    do have to report it.” So my tour came to an end and I went off. I was back on
                    home leave between assignments, and my sister came in with the morning
                    newspaper, and she said, “Mike, I see here that Deane Hinton had been declared
                    persona non grata.” So I thought thank heaven I was spared, got out of there two
                    weeks before this happened. Of course Sheldon Vance came back temporarily to
                    smooth things over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well while you were there, in the first place, did any of
                        the Shaba things down there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No it did not. The Shaba province is rich in copper ore; Lubumbashi is
                    the capital. The Belgians had built this fantastic copper mining and smelting
                    operation there. It looked like a diminutive grand canyon with these enormous
                    trucks going down to bring out the ore. The cooper ingots were shipped out
                    through Angola at that time. That was the shortest distance down to the Atlantic
                    port. Lubumbashi had been the scene of fighting between rival factions at the
                    time of independence after the Belgians left. It was there that Lumumba was
                    murdered and Frank Carlucci, the consul, was stabbed (fortunately, not fatally).
                    By 1972 the Belgian holding company, Societ� Generale, had returned and Belgian
                    experts ran the copper operation. The local population seemed content.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with, Zaire was known as an
                        enclave of the CIA. How did you find dealing with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well by that time the thing had become more or less regularized. The
                    famous CIA officer, Larry Devlin, who had helped Mobutu at the time of
                    independence had retired from the agency but kept in touch with Mobutu. When I
                    got there, the CIA station chief was very much integrated with the embassy. He
                    would go and see Mobutu, and he would brief the ambassador on what was going on.
                    He didn't go off on any tangents in doing things that we didn't know about or
                    approve. There was a scary moment towards the end of my stay, Sheldon Vance was
                    still there. Mobutu decided that he had to have a presidential airplane. So he
                    wanted a DC-10. McDonnell Douglas were just thrilled. They came to Kinshasa and
                    negotiated what the plane should look like. The actual signing was to be done in
                    Washington. Mobutu sent his minister of commerce, a man named Eketebbe, to
                    Washington to sign the final contract. Sheldon then sent a classified telegram
                    to the Department informing Washington what was happening. He said, “I think you
                    ought to insist on a cost-benefit analysis about what it is going to cost to run
                    this plane.” When Eketebbe got to Washington, somebody in either the State
                    Department or Commerce or someplace tipped off McDonnell Douglas. So McDonnell
                    Douglas went to the Zairian and said, “The ambassador in Kinshasa thinks we
                    ought to have a cost-benefit analysis first.” Mobutu was furious. He summoned
                    the CIA station chief and said, “I am not going to declare Vance persona non
                    grata, but tell him that I have lost confidence in him.” Well, Sheldon was
                    devastated by this. When Mobutu made one of his trips to his villa in Brussels,
                    Sheldon wanted to go up there and talk to him and explain this was sort of
                    standard operating procedure. I persuaded him not to go. “You were entirely
                    right to ask for the analysis. This is an over reaction. I don't think you ought
                    to go hat in hand to Mobutu.” So he didn't. Eventually things calmed down, the
                    plane was bought and Sheldon was awarded the Order of the Leopard prior to his
                    departure.</p>
                <p>Devlin came back to Kinshasa as a business representative, he was somehow
                    associated with Morris Tempelsman, the diamond merchant. We were wondering if we
                    were going to have any problems. As far as I know he stuck to his diamond
                    thing.</p>
                <p>The biggest thing that happened on my watch there was the contract for building
                    of the world's longest electric transmission line between a dam on the Congo
                    River to Lubumbashi, several hundred miles south to carry the electricity down
                    there for an expansion of the smelting operation. Ex-Im Bank was in charge of
                    the overall project which was to cost about $700,000,000. It was the largest
                    thing at that time that Ex-Im Bank had agreed to oversee. I was charg�. All of a
                    sudden the thing threatened to come apart at the very last moment over some of
                    the other people that were to participate in this consortium for the Inga-Shaba
                    line. So I stepped in and managed to get the parties together. It was a
                    shortfall of $270,000,000 which we were able to put back together. That then
                    enabled the thing to go forward. The legal documents were voluminous and
                    provided for benchmarks before funds would be released.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the corruption situation. I have
                        varying accounts. One that Mobutu was just robbing the country blind, but
                        other accounts that actually all of the so-called robbed money was playing
                        the typical tribal chieftain and taking and spreading it around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I would say both of these. There was no question that the country was
                    being robbed blind. But I happened to be in the office of the foreign minister
                    Nguza who came from Shaba. Mobutu called him up. I could tell whom he was
                    talking “Oui Monsieur Le President.” I said, “Do you want me to leave?” Nguza
                    said, “No, you stay.” It was Mobutu telling Nguza what presents he wanted sent
                    to his governor in Kisangani up the river. I could tell from the things he was
                    writing down that it was household things, bolts of cloth, this, that, and the
                    other thing. He did spread favors around, that is true. That was an effective
                    way of maintaining their loyalty. I don't have any impression that there were
                    any great human rights abuses or anything like that. Mobutu was such a
                    charismatic person. He embodied the “Revolution.” One thing again that Deane
                    Hinton did. This was before he made the visit to call on the cardinal. Through I
                    guess intercepts, he found out that the central bank was about to ship the
                    silver deposit, the entire silver deposit in the national bank to a storefront
                    in Jersey City. Deane got permission, with a lot of back and forth, to tell this
                    to Mobutu. So he called up Mobutu and said this is what is going on. Mobutu
                    said, “Je suis shock�e.” “I will immediately put a stop to this. The president
                    of the central bank, (who was a Zairian) will explain it all to you.” Of course
                    we never got any explanation of what was going on . This was one of Mobutu's
                    things. It was one of the things that was a black mark against Deane and helped
                    lead to his being PNG'd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the things I have heard about Mobutu was that
                        rather than some of the other dictators in Africa, he tended rather than
                        sticking his opposition in jail to give them jobs and move them around and
                        bring them back. I mean you were in power; you were out of power but you
                        didn't necessarily end up in jail. You just lost your job, and maybe after a
                        couple of years you were back in with another job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think that is how Mobutu operated. An American businessman was out in
                    the interior and he called on the local governor. When he went into the outer
                    office, there was a radio on, and it was tuned to Kinshasa. It was playing loud
                    enough so it could also be heard in the governor's office. The governor
                    mentioned this. He said, “You probably wonder why I have that radio going all
                    the time. The reason is that when Kinshasa says that I am being transferred, I
                    want to know it at the same time those bastards outside my office know it.”
                    People in important offices could profit from bribes and kickbacks. An embassy
                    family lived next to Minister Eketebbe who did the DC10 deal. For some reason
                    Mobutu sent the police to arrest him. The diplomats heard a great commotion next
                    door and boxes of cash were thrown over the garden wall. The Americans threw
                    them back..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the Belgian business
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh they were very important. There were a lot of Belgians that did the
                    technical work in things like the bank. The operation I must tell you down in
                    Lubumbashi was just mind boggling when you saw that. Not only was it this vast
                    reserve of copper ore, not far from it was one that was just as big that even
                    had more copper content. Tempelsman and Devlin were interested in developing a
                    second mine near Lubumbashi but it did not come to fruition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how about the Congo which has been replete with
                        missionaries. How did you find the missionary population. American
                        missionaries and the foreign service are not exactly cuddly close. I mean
                        they have different agendas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That is well said. Depending on the country it can be quite a problem.
                    During the time that I was in Kinshasa, we for some reason, I don't know why. We
                    did not have a great many missionaries. They were mainly in the interior far
                    from Kinshasa. I don't know whether it was because of the French language or
                    what. Mobutu, even though he and the cardinal had their differences, Catholic
                    churches operated freely throughout the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that American missionaries who would just by
                        nature be protestant, did they have any problems there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Not that I know of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have any great evacuations which we had during
                        some of its earlier days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: At the time of independence things were very dicey. A group of American
                    journalists was arrested by newly formed Zairian troops and were about to be
                    shot as communists when the consul, Alison Palmer, arrived, called Mobutu and
                    got them released.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about along the Burundi Rwanda border. Did you find
                        that the rift of the central government ran very much. The Congo was such a
                        huge place; were there sort of local warlords?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No. We went up to visit what used to be the Albert National Park,
                    Burundi. It was at that time one of the great nature reserves in the world. We
                    had a consulate in Bukavu. The consul had a wonderful Belgian villa, and the
                    peace corps was there. You can't imagine the difference in that and what
                    happened later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay then in '75 you are off. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I am off. I was sitting on my deck and the telephone rang. It was Roy
                    Atherton. He was then assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs. He
                    said, “Mike, I would like you to go to Jerusalem as consul general.” When I had
                    worked at the UN, I had made a tour of the middle east countries. One of the
                    ones that I was most struck with and fascinated by was Israel and in
                    particularly Jerusalem. I said, “I accept.” I told my wife, “Milena, you will
                    never guess what. We are going to Jerusalem.” She was just as excited as I. Two
                    days later the telephone rang and it was Roy Atherton. He said, “Mike, Nick
                    Veliotes is going to be leaving Tel Aviv. I would like you to go down and
                    replace him as DCM.” I said, “Well Gee, let me think this over. I have to talk
                    to my wife.” He said, “I really would like you to be down there.” Both Milena
                    and I had no interest in going to Tel Aviv. I said, “Well at least I will have
                    my own mission because I will not report to anyone else except the State
                    Department.” I said, “Down there I would be working for somebody else, I will go
                    with Jerusalem. So that is what we did. The ambassador to Israel was replaced at
                    the same time. Our long standing ambassador, Wally Barbour, was replaced by Mac
                    Toon. Mac Toon had been a cold warrior all his life and while US-Israeli
                    relations were certainly important, we did have other interests in the Middle
                    East too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been in Russia...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: And Eastern Europe, that's right, and he was a real cold warrior. So Mac
                    wound up as the ambassador there. I called on him before going out. He said,
                    “Now Mike, I want you to know, that I don't agree that the consulate general
                    should be an independent post. I think in a country that all consulates should
                    report through the embassy. I am going to take this up with the Secretary.” I
                    said, “Fine Mac. I am sure that this has been done, tried before. It is all an
                    integral part of the final solution to the Israeli Palestinian thing. So let me
                    know.” So he did mention it to Kissinger. Kissinger said, “No, that has got to
                    be part of the final negotiation. We can't change the status of Jerusalem.” So
                    off we both went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was there from 1975 to 1980. I had four years there. The most
                    fascinating post that one could possibly imagine. So much history and political
                    and religious importance concentrated in this one city. I was of course,
                    responsible for all of Jerusalem both East and West Jerusalem and all of the
                    West Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But not Gaza.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Not Gaza. Gaza for some reason was under the embassy. I don't know for
                    what arcane reason. Before I left I was also dealing with the Gazans
                    diplomatically, having them come up to Jerusalem to meet with Hal Saunders and
                    other officials. So before I got there, I guess it had almost been two years
                    before I got there, the Israelis had permitted free elections to take place in
                    the occupied territories. I am sure they are the only open and honest free
                    elections that had probably happened in the Arab world up until that time. The
                    result is you had a bunch of Palestinians and Gazans, both in Gaza and on the
                    West Bank, that were elected freely by their constituents. So I got to know them
                    and worked with them. At first I think they were somewhat chary of me, but I
                    explained to them what our position was. That they should determine their own
                    future but this had to be through negotiations. The basic idea is that Israel
                    would withdraw from most of the occupied territory and the Palestinians would
                    accept Israel's right to exist in peace. I had the great good fortune to be
                    there at the time of Sadat's visit. That was something I will never forget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about before. When you arrived in '75,
                        what was the situation in Jerusalem and the West Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Things were quiet compared to what they were later. The elected
                    officials, elected Palestinians, ran and administered the civilian side of life
                    there, the schools and everything like that. The elected Palestinians all
                    supported Arafat who was then in Tunis. The Israeli military were omnipresent.
                    But that didn't seem to cause any great friction. They knew that was their only
                    way of getting through to the Israelis was through the military. The thing that
                    I focused on was the Israeli settlements. They were just breaking ground for
                    this mammoth settlement in the desert right to the east of Jerusalem called
                    Ma'ale Adumim. I think it now has something like 40,000 people there But then it
                    was just some bull dozers in the desert. So I raised this with Atherton. I said,
                    “Roy, his is going to be a cancer. They are just going hell bent and taking what
                    little land the Palestinians had that they had owned for centuries and fencing
                    it in, large areas, and building these settlements there.” Roy said, “Oh well,
                    we don't support the settlement activity. The money that we give to the Israelis
                    we say none of it can be used for settlement.” Money was fungible, so there was
                    no disincentive not to go full steam ahead with that. So that was a major

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our embassy feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Interesting that you would ask. Here again I was not told that this
                    particular project was in train. But Mac Toon without any consultation with me
                    persuaded the secretary and President Carter to write a letter to Prime Minister
                    Rabin proposing that there should be a moratorium on settlements. That
                    presumably might interest the Palestinians in negotiations. So Mac Toon gets in
                    his car and comes up to Jerusalem and goes to see Rabin and says, “I have a
                    letter from the President for you.” Rabin looks at it and says, “I can't accept
                    this. If I accept this the government will fall. Do you want to have a Likud
                    government? Do you want to have somebody like Begin here?” Toon said, “Oh
                    heavens no, we don't want anything like that.” Rabin said, “You had better take
                    the letter back.” So Toon's heart was in the right place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting. I am not sure but this I guess this
                        is not the period where Jerusalem had, particularly the military were pretty
                        beastly to the West Bank Palestinians. We had a bunch of very activist vice
                        consuls that were running around reporting on the beastliness which got into
                        the New York Times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes, the momentarily famous Miss Johnson was a vice consul in the visa
                    section. We did a human rights telegram which was classified, We put in there
                    our findings, what we were told by Palestinians who seemed credible of the
                    mistreatment of anybody Israelis suspected of being a terrorist. Jerusalem 1500,
                    that was the number of our telegram. That was leaked in its entirety by Miss
                    Johnson. At the same time because she wasn't suited for the foreign service she
                    was terminated. The Department spokesman had to face the media and say that her
                    dismissal from the foreign service had nothing to do with the leak which was the
                    case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Miss Johnson? Could you explain a little more
                        about Miss Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Miss Johnson was a number. She had a Russian mother; she had a Russian
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her first name? Do you know her first name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: I believe it is Alexandria. When she came into the foreign service she
                    was assigned to Beirut. Beirut then blew up while she was there. She was on the
                    Islamic side of town when the town was divided. So she stayed over on the other
                    side of town and didn't have any contact with the embassy. She was supposed to
                    have been very active in the Islamic community and she didn't have any trouble.
                    Then her second post was Jerusalem. She took an interest immediately in the
                    Palestinians and how were they being treated by the Israelis. She did have very
                    good contacts I must say. But it turned out after she was there for six months
                    that her supervisors came to me and said, “We don't think that she is foreign
                    service material.” They said, to me “We have our doubts whether she is foreign
                    service material, but six months is a short time. Can we give her another
                    cycle?” I said, “Oh all right. I think six months is rather short.” When the
                    next cycle came around they had changed the rules and the evaluation of her
                    performance had to be signed by me as the chief of mission. By that time I had
                    decided that yes, she just wasn't suited. Smart woman. She received a letter
                    from personnel informing her that she was being separated She put the notice in
                    her desk drawer and said nothing. The Department did not inform me and several
                    months passed before this episode came to light.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am wondering if there was anything you might say of a
                        professional nature that made her unsuited.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: One night the political officer called up and said, “Alexandria is
                    missing.” I said, “What?” He said, “Yes. She was invited to a dinner with some
                    people from the consulate general, and others and she never showed up for
                    dinner, and she never called. We think you had better notify the Department.” I
                    said, “Well do you really think that it is that serious.” The political officer
                    said, “Well this has never happened before.” I said, “All right, call up the
                    situation room and tell them that she didn't show up and that we will notify the
                    Israelis. So fortunately before we told the Israeli officials, it turned out
                    that she was over in East Jerusalem before the dinner and she met some
                    Palestinian she got to talking to. They just went off together and she never let
                    anybody know she wasn't coming to dinner. That is one thing, but there were
                    other incidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you have the feeling that through her reports
                        were biased. Everything about Israel and Palestine is ticklish and
                        political. I mean there are times when I suspect the reporting on Israelis
                        are treated with kid gloves. We don't over report the nasty side of things.
                        But at the same time when you are dealing with something like Palestinians,
                        was she sort of on the other side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: However I just say that insofar as the substance of her reporting on this
                    sensitive issue, that was accurate or I wouldn't have let the telegram go out. I
                    signed off on this telegram, this famous telegram, telegram 1500. It was printed
                    verbatim I guess in the New York Times, and large parts of it in the Washington
                    Post.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in this report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well allegations by family members and in some cases it was former
                    prisoners of the way they were treated. We had one person from Ramallah that we
                    relied on for what was going on locally. He was picked up by the Israelis. We
                    protested that we knew him well and that he would never have anything to do with
                    terrorists. He was let go. Torture may be too far, but his descriptions of what
                    he had to put up with while he was incarcerated were troubling. They probably
                    treated him somewhat with kid gloves because they knew that we were very
                    friendly with him and valued his insights. Let's put it this way. There was
                    enough of these stories of people being left at night in the winter time with
                    windows open and they would be naked and have no blankets or anything like that.
                    Of course with what is going on now days this is hardly a shocking thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Israeli authorities? The mayor of
                        Jerusalem is of course, a major player in these things. I can't think of his
                        name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Teddy Kollek. He was wonderful. Teddy, like all the Israelis had his
                    misgivings about the consulate general, but he knew we were a factor in
                    Jerusalem life. So we got along very well. He would entertain us whenever he
                    would have important visitors. I decided early on that I had to assert my
                    protocol rights. When we had high ranking official delegations that I would be
                    the one that would escort them around East Jerusalem. I got to meet quite a lot
                    of people that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were basically the Israeli apparatchiks, the people
                        you had to deal with. Did they try to put a freeze or give you a rough
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, because they weren't supposed to be dealing with me. I could go over
                    and see the head of the consular affairs section in the foreign ministry. Then
                    there were some Israeli diplomats that I had worked with in New York. So I would
                    see them occasionally. There was one very interesting that happened. In those
                    days in the reporting telegram, you would report your facts, and then the
                    Department took to saying, if you would like to, you could make a comment at the
                    end. But it should only be a comment interpreting what was in your report. It
                    wasn't really supposed to be a policy recommendation. Well, once I fudged that.
                    In my comment, it was something to do with the West Bank, and I said something
                    to the effect that well if we want to accomplish a particular aim, we could do
                    whatever I was proposing. I forget what it was. So that was sent off. Then David
                    Korn, who was the officer in charge of Arab Israeli affairs, called me up two
                    days later. “Oh Mike, you will be interested to know that telegram you sent in,
                    your recommendation has been approved.” I nearly dropped the telephone. I said,
                    “What are you talking about?” He said, “Yes. Your telegram came out of the oval
                    office and in the margins was written OK, J.C.” I said, “Now you don't mean to
                    tell me, David, that the president reads my telegrams.” He said, “You would be
                    surprised how many of your telegrams the President reads.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get along with Mac Toon. He wasn't there the
                        whole time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, he wasn't there. I got along with Mac all right. In the past there
                    were times when the consul general and the ambassador in Tel Aviv never spoke to
                    each other. Mac and I made sure we would keep in touch. In fact Mac would invite
                    us down to dinner, and we would also reciprocate with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Then while we were there, the big election took place in Israel. Sam Lewis who
                    was the new ambassador, was en route to Tel Aviv when the election took place,
                    so he stopped off for a day or two en route. Then to everybody's amazement, the
                    Likud won, Begin was Prime Minister instead of Rabin. Before that, Begin had
                    made a trip to Washington and nobody would receive him. No high level meetings.
                    Sam had been briefed about all of the Labor people he would be dealing with,
                    Rabin and Peres and others. So the first weekend he was in Tel Aviv, I guess
                    people in the embassy didn't want to appear too forward, so I called him up and
                    I said, “Sam, if you are not doing anything, would you like to come up to
                    Jerusalem this weekend?' He said, “Mike I would like nothing better.” So we are
                    sitting in the garden and he said, “Mike, what am I going to do? All I have been
                    briefed on was the Labor people. Nobody knows anything about Begin except he has
                    the reputation he is a former terrorist and a hard liner.” I said, “Sam, you are
                    in the cat bird seat.” You are the one that will be educating official
                    Washington as to what kind of person Begin is.” So that is the way turned out.
                    Sam and I worked together very closely. There was an incident where one of my
                    vice consuls on Saturday was driving around the West Bank and decided that he
                    would drive into one of the settlements on the West Bank and just see what an
                    Israeli settlement was like, unannounced. So pretty soon his car was noticed
                    that didn't have an Israeli license plate and the settlers detained him for
                    several hours. Monday morning he was beside himself. He said, “We ought to
                    protest diplomatically. A consular officer has diplomatic immunity.” I said,
                    “Yes you did, but at any rate we are going to have to bring the embassy in on
                    this and the Department.” I didn't want to tell him that he should have asked me
                    should he do this. I would have said no you shouldn't. Sam was wonderful, and we
                    got instructions from the Department that in a low key but very firm way, said,
                    that this person enjoyed diplomatic immunity, and that he did not so far as we
                    could determine break any laws. Sam consulted me about this. I said, “I think
                    this is just right, Sam.” Sam then carried out the instructions at the foreign
                    ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the Camp David process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play form your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Wonderfully for abut 24 hours. I was sitting in my office, it was on
                    Friday I guess it was and the telephone rang. It was Dick Viets who was charg�
                    d'affairs down in Tel Aviv. Dick said, “Mike, go turn on your television set,
                    and you will see the signing of the Camp David agreement in the White House.” I
                    said, “What.” I hear all this. I just couldn't believe my eyes to see Sadat,
                    Carter, and Begin all shaking hands and smiling. Then Carter, then in a brief
                    statement said, “And while these negotiations under the agreement take place,
                    settlement activity will be suspended.” So I called Viets back and said, “This
                    is really something. This is much broader than an Israeli Egyptian bilateral
                    peace treaty. This is attempting to deal with the whole problem.” Because you
                    are dealing with the settlements. Carter then repeated that phrase again the
                    next day when he addressed the joint session of Congress and explained what it
                    meant. So I was euphoric. I said, “This is really a great breakthrough.” Two
                    days later, Begin went up to New York to meet with the Jewish leadership. They
                    said, “You, a disciple of Jabotinsky, agreed to a moratorium on settlements?”
                    Begin looked at them and said, “Do you think I would ever do anything like that?
                    I never agreed to do that.” This was something Carter was trying to impose. It
                    had not been agreed to formally. Carter was trying to advance the thing. So the
                    next day Viets called me up and told me this had happened. I said, “Well it is
                    going to be, I won't say only, but it is going to be a bilateral peace agreement
                    between Israel and Egypt.” He said, “Well Dyan is coming back early, Moshe Dyan
                    the foreign minister, is coming back earlier this afternoon. I will meet him at
                    the airport. I am going to raise this with him.” He called me back and said, “I
                    raised it with Dyan and Dyan said yes I noticed that. Don't worry I will sort it
                    out with the prime minister.” Of course it never did get sorted out because they
                    went full steam ahead with settlements. The great irony of all of this is that,
                    and I am told this happened at Camp David, when it all came down to a make or
                    break thing at the last, are the Israelis going to remove all of the settlements
                    from Sinai. Begin called up Sharon who was not in the government at that time,
                    but who was the father of the settlement activity. Called up Sharon and said,
                    “Ariel, it has come down to this. If we want an agreement, we are going to have
                    to sign this.” Sharon said, “You do what you have to do.” Then the irony is that
                    at the end, it was Sharon as prime minister who removed not only all of the
                    settlements in Gaza, but he was ready to go about removing the majority of them
                    on the West Bank until his stroke.</p>

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well back then, immediately after the Camp David Agreements were signed,
                    after I got the text of the agreement and saw what it actually meant, I didn't
                    wait for any instructions. I got in my car and started the length and breadth of
                    the West Bank calling on the mayors and the other notables. My line was, this is
                    your chance. You complain now about all these years of occupation and
                    interference in your affairs. You have a chance under this to negotiate with the
                    Israelis under the framework agreement. Universally they told me we can't do
                    anything without Arafat's permission, and he is in Tunis. Arafat wasn't about to
                    let the West Bank mayors negotiate. Hal Saunders, who had replaced Atherton as
                    the assistant secretary, came out. I arranged a meeting at the Consulate general
                    in Jerusalem with the mayors and also with the notables from Gaza. This was the
                    first time the Gazans had met with the West Bankers in Jerusalem. I had started
                    going down to Gaza and meeting with them and getting to know them, but they
                    wouldn't come up and talk to me. But when Saunders invited them they came up.
                    Saunders told them exactly what I had been saying. He said, “What do I tell the
                    secretary of state when I get back? Do I tell him you are not going to take
                    advantage of this great opportunity?” They all to a man said, “We can't do
                    anything without Arafat's permission.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period when we were not talking to the
                        PLO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflection on Arafat because he
                        turned out as a figure, he turned out to have the most fatal flaw of all. He
                        couldn't close the deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well, it was interesting. There was a recent conference organized on the
                    Middle East by a group that was associated with something called Nevi Shalom
                    Wahat al Salaam, which is a joint Jewish Arab settlement in Israel proper. Sam
                    Lewis moderated it. We had a group of very good people there on the panel. One
                    of them was David Miller who was at the Clinton Camp David meetings. He said,
                    “The problem with the Camp David meeting that was held was that we knew that
                    Arafat's one consideration was survival. He was in no position by that time to
                    make a meaningful deal. He had no security services that could enforce anything.
                    We can't stop suicide bombings.” Arafat was afraid of assassination if he agreed
                    Palestinian refugees could not return. By that time, the whole Arafat
                    administration had become so corrupt, and people were disillusioned.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I gave Barak, the Israeli prime minister at that time great admiration for what
                    he proposed. It was basically what I did in one of my telegrams after I had
                    talked to some people in the foreign ministry. This was in the days when Rabin
                    and Peres were still in power, you didn't yet have an intifada. Yes, there were
                    very occasional suicide bombings but other than that it was not so bad. I found
                    the people that I was talking to in the foreign ministry said, oh, we can solve
                    Jerusalem and to live in peace. If it comes to the temple mount the Palestinians
                    can have the dome of the rock and they can have Al-Aqsa Mosque. They can even
                    fly a flag alongside the Israeli flag. We can work all of this out. All this was
                    before Begin and Shamir. The tragedy is that after the Oslo accords when the PLO
                    agreed to negotiate a peace settlement with Israel and Rabin and Arafat shook
                    hands on the White House lawn, Arafat was so weak he could not control the
                    security situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were there, I can't remember, Sadat came to
                        Jerusalem before Camp David. It must have been before. Did that come as
                        quite a shocker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: We happened to be having dinner with Israeli friends just before this.
                    All during the dinner the friends said, “Do you think Sadat is really coming. Is
                    he really coming?” I said, “All I know is what I hear on the radio and see on
                    the television. He said he is coming, so I have to assume that he is coming.” So
                    I happened to be over at the King David Hotel when the advance group from Cairo
                    arrived. I said hello to them and they seemed glad to see me. They said, “Oh,
                    you are from the consulate general.” I said, “If there is anything we can do to
                    help you while you are here, you let us know.” So it turned out that Osama Al
                    Baz who was the chief advisor to Sadat said, “We would greatly appreciate it if
                    the night before Sadat's speech to the Knesset you cold type it in English for
                    us. We don't want the Israelis to see it before he gives it.” I said, “Oh yes,
                    we can do that.” So I sent my secretary over to Osama's room at the King David
                    Hotel late at night. Osama al Baz opened the door. Unfortunately he was in his
                    underwear.. He said, “Here it is.” So she took it and went back to the consulate
                    general and typed it all up. We immediately sent it off to Washington and Cairo.
                    It was very interesting then to the next day to listen to his speech and
                    Weitzman, who I think by that time was minister of defense, was very alarmed.
                    Instead of welcoming this historic initiative, he went to Begin and said, “We
                    must be on the alert. We must be ready for an attack.” That was how he reacted.
                    I told my daughter a couple of days later, “We are going over to the King David
                    Hotel, get your identification.” So we went over there. We were in the lobby,
                    and I said, “Now in a few minutes through that door over there is going to come
                    the president of Egypt walking arm in arm with the prime minister of Israel.
                    This is an historic moment.”</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>One funny thing going back to Mac Toon, Mac Toon knew that in the past the
                    Israeli embassy and Kissinger had things going which were not always shared with
                    the field. Mac said, “I told Kissinger before I came out that I wasn't having
                    any of this, that I am the ambassador and the senior representative in Israel,
                    and I want to be completely informed.” So then I noticed in the paper that there
                    had been a meeting, a reported meeting between Kissinger and Denitz, the Israeli
                    ambassador. Yet we had no reporting telegram out of Washington giving the
                    substance of it. So I rang Mac up and said, “Oh Mac, did you see that report in
                    the paper the other day that Kissinger and Denitz had met but I hadn't received
                    any reporting telegram. Have you seen anything, Mac?” He said, “No, I haven't. I
                    am going off to Washington next week, and I am going to raise this with
                    Kissinger.” So when he came back I asked, “What happened?” He said, Kissinger
                    told me, “Ah, Denitz amuses me.” That was his only comment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I think every four years during the primaries
                        for election as president in the United States, when the primary season gets
                        close to New York, they raise the subject that every candidate swears
                        absolute fealty to the idea that we are going to put our American embassy in
                        Jerusalem. It has been 40 or 50 years and it hasn't happened. How did you
                        all feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well, I don't know what the current status of the consulate general is.
                    My successor, Edward Abington as consul general, he did at a certain stage when
                    Carter was in office, he did have, frequent contact with Arafat in Gaza. Later
                    on when he left his post he became an advisor to Arafat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He still is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He still is an advisor to the Palestinians. The Israelis I would get
                    reports from people that had gone to diner with cabinet members of the Israeli
                    government. They would denounce the consulate general and denounce me in
                    particular. I think it would be a big mistake to change that. I know it is a
                    nuisance, and I am sure if I were ambassador to Tel Aviv to have to go up to
                    Jerusalem all the time. It is not all that long a drive, but still, you have
                    that nuisance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is such a political issue because it is recognizing the
                        '67 war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right. It always goes back to the foundation of Israel, the basic
                    resolution recognizing Israel back to Truman's time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, could you sort of compare and contrast
                        dealing with the Israelis, not necessarily just the official, but Israelis
                        friends and people you knew with the Palestinians. Were they two different
                        breeds of cat or pretty much the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: There was a difference. Even under occupation the Palestinians were more
                    how do you say it, accessible. More accessible, and the best way to describe
                    this is the experience of a young foreign service officer. This is after I
                    retired and was back working in PM. He had been sent to the Israeli foreign
                    ministry one summer to work as an intern. I said, “Oh I see you were down in Tel
                    Aviv.” “Yeah, working in the political section.” I said, “How did you enjoy
                    that?” He said, “Mike, that was an interesting experience of in your face
                    diplomacy.” I guess it comes from the whole experience and background of many
                    Israelis and all that some of them went through, but others, even the sabras,
                    the Jews that were born in Israel could be pretty prickly. On the other hand in
                    Jerusalem we had good friends who were Sephardic Jews whose ancestors were
                    expelled from Spain in 1492. their family had live in Jerusalem for
                    generations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel or impact of the various Jewish
                        American groups? There is such a strong influence on our policy right from
                        the beginning. Did that impact on you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No it didn't I was lucky in that regard. After I left there was a sort of
                    a blow up at the consulate general with some of them who went ballistic when the
                    consul told them we regarded the settlements as illegal. I will tell you one
                    interesting experience I had. There is an ultra orthodox Jewish group which I
                    don't believe you have ever heard of called Naturae Carta. These are orthodox
                    Jews that do not accept or recognize the Israeli state because it is a
                    sacrilege. The Israeli state and the Temple can only be rebuilt by the Messiah.
                    Anything short of that is a sacrilege. So one day my secretary came in and said,
                    “Rabbi Hersch wants to call on you.” I said, “Fine I would love to see him.” He
                    lived over in the ultra orthodox part of Jerusalem. So here he comes in with his
                    black hat, pale as can be, long Shirley Temple curls coming out. He said, “Mr.
                    Consul General, can you help me get in touch with Arafat?” I said, “Well I can't
                    because the policy of the United States government is to have nothing to do with
                    Arafat because we consider him a terrorist, and I can't speak to him, and I
                    can't get messages to him. I said, “May I ask you, Rabbi Hersch, why do you want
                    to contact him.” He said, “Well you know this present government here.” I said,
                    “Yes.” He said, “Well they are nationalist.” I said, “Yes, they are nationalist.
                    They are building this state.” He said, “And they are socialist.” I said, “Yes.”
                    “You put national socialism together and you know what you get.” They didn't
                    recognize the existence of Israel; they wouldn't use Israeli money. They would
                    only use dollars. They wouldn't serve in the army, and they wouldn't go to
                    Israeli schools.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Lubavitch. The Lubavitch Rabbi lives in New York, he wouldn't go to

                <p>NEWLIN: They don't accept it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an odd group. One forgets that Zionism was not
                        something that was accepted by a significant portion of the Jewish community
                        of World Jewry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: You are entirely right. I nearly fell out of my chair when this rabbi
                    wanted to get in touch with Arafat.</p>
                <p>As I say, I had the best relations with Teddy Kollek. He called me up one day and
                    said, “Mike, would you like to have lunch with Danny Kaye.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A world famous movie actor and comedian, Jewish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Comedian, very famous. I said, “Oh I would love to.” Kollek said, “I will
                    send my car around. Danny is gong to have lunch with some Palestinians over on
                    the Mount of Olives. I thought you might be interested in going along.” So we
                    were riding down the street in Jerusalem. Danny was trying to find out whether I
                    was Jewish or not. He said, “What's your name?” I said, “Newlin.” “Spell that.”
                    I said, “N E W L I N.” What is your first and middle name?” “Michael Holt.” “Do
                    you speak Hebrew?” I said, “Well, I speak a little bit of Hebrew.” He said, “Do
                    you speak Arabic?” I said, “Well I speak a little bit of Arabic,” but I said,
                    “Here because of the fact that this was a British mandate for so very long,
                    everybody that I deal with, both Israelis and Palestinians speak English.” He
                    said, “Well say something in Arabic for me.” I said, “Alan Ra Salan.” Danny
                    said, “No that isn't right. It is Aahlaan Raasaalaan.” Wait until I tell people
                    that I am riding down the main street in Jerusalem with Danny Kaye and he is
                    giving me Arabic lessons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I would have thought that you would have had some of
                        the Jewish, I mean the Israelis were promoting and with very good reason,
                        tours of Israel by any Jewish group that raised its head.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh that was a very big business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I would have thought that you would have been part of
                        the tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: No. The last thing the Israelis would want would be a briefing by the
                    American consul general. They wanted to monopolize the tour business. We were
                    friendly with an American Franciscan priest who often escorted wealthy Catholic
                    visitors. At Capernaum in Galilee he was asked by an Israeli guide if he had an
                    Israeli tour guide permit. Because of his important visitors the Israelis did
                    not press the point. When Vice President Mondale came I escorted Mondale in what
                    sight seeing he was able to do in East Jerusalem. Then I took Mrs. Mondale on an
                    extensive tour of Jerusalem. I had to become a tour guide to survive. So I
                    started it out. I would say, “I am giving you today, the secular democratic tour
                    of Jerusalem. If you had time you would spend three days. You would go first,
                    and take an Israeli tour. That would be the Jewish tour. Then a second day you
                    would go and take the Christian tour. Finally, you would take the Arabic tour.
                    And you would never know from each one of these compartmentalized tours, that
                    there was anything other than the specialized agenda being presented. This is
                    where King David and Solomon lived, etc., etc. Then the Christians and all the
                    speculation as to where specific events happened. Then you go to the Arabs and
                    Suleiman the Magnificent was here.” So I had to become a tour guide. This was
                    the only thing that I disagreed with Teddy Kollek on because Teddy didn't want
                    me to conduct the Americans around. He wanted to take over that. I said, “No,
                    Teddy.” Depending on the visitor, we would have an argument on this point. In
                    Mondale's case, Teddy and I both escorted him in East Jerusalem. Oh, I had Ms.
                    Lillian, President Carter's mother. When Golda Meier died, Ms. Lillian was sent,
                    his mother, to represent. I took Ms. Lillian all around. Took her to the Church
                    of the Holy Sepulcher, took her to Bethlehem. Then the Israelis insisted that
                    she go to Yad Vashem which is their holocaust museum, a big holocaust museum and
                    cemetery around. Ms. Lillian didn't appreciate that at all. She said, “When I
                    think about how many American soldiers have died and everything,” she didn't go
                    for that. I was also the sole guide in East Jerusalem for former President
                    Ford.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Mike this would probably be a good place to
                        stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1980, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: In 1980 I went back to the Department and I wound up as principal deputy
                    assistant secretary in the bureau of international organization affairs and the
                    assistant secretary was one William Charles Maynes. Bill Maynes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we will pick this up then, and you were doing that from
                        when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I did that for a little over a year. I did it until pretty much the
                    beginning of the Reagan administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is 4, December 2006. Mike, we are so 1980, IO.
                        In the first place what was your impression about how Bill Maynes ran
                        things? Charles William Maynes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I had it wrong. You are correct. It is Charles William Maynes. Bill
                    Maynes. I might say a word how I got the job. I mentioned I think earlier that
                    one of the things that I had to do as consul general was become a tour guide of
                    Jerusalem. And when VIPs came to Jerusalem, it was my job to show them around
                    all of the various sights. Bill Maynes happened to be one of them and we hit it
                    off. It just so happened that Roger Kirk's assignment in IO as principal deputy
                    assistant secretary was coming to an end, so Bill was kind enough to ask me to
                    come back to IO, which I was glad to do. I got along very well with Bill. He
                    obviously was a very liberal well connected Democrat, an intellectual and I
                    believe he was a former Rhodes Scholar. We got along very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In IO what issues did you find yourself particularly
                        dealing with in this '80-'81 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well we dealt of course with the full panoply of issues that come up in
                    the UN either in the Security Council or the General Assembly and other UN
                    bodies. It is important to note at this time that our permanent representative
                    in New York was Don McHenry who replaced Andrew Young who was fired because he
                    met secretly with the PLO. McHenry was a different kettle of fish than Andy
                    Young who was very easy going. McHenry had a background as a foreign service
                    officer, so he knew how the Department worked. So while we all shared the same
                    goals, sometimes things were a little bit dicey. My five minutes fame happened
                    to arise over an issue in the Security Council dealing with Israeli settlements.
                    It happened at a time towards the elections in 1980 when the Arab delegations
                    joined by quite a few of the non Arab delegations had a draft resolution in the
                    Security Council that was critical of new Israeli settlement activity in East
                    Jerusalem. Our policy had been up to that point one of saying this was a
                    violation of international law, that the Israelis should not unilaterally
                    attempt to change the situation on the ground in the occupied territories to the
                    detriment of the inhabitants there. McHenry very much wanted us to support a
                    resolution that had some critical language of Israel in it. He worked very hard
                    with the Arab delegations to come up with a softer version thereof. As luck
                    would have it, Bill Maynes and the assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs,
                    Hal Saunders, were both out of town when this came to a head. Embassy Tel Aviv
                    went over to the foreign ministry and consulted on the text of this resolution
                    and reported, “They didn't seem to be particularly exercised over it. McHenry
                    and NEA, the acting assistant secretary in Hal Saunders' absence was Michael
                    Sterner who was a near eastern expert, and myself, all of us noticed this. So we
                    then went to Secretary Vance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would have been Muskie.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Muskie came a little bit later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it would have been Vance then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. And so we went to the secretary and he in previous meetings with him
                    whenever he came to Jerusalem he was very much against the settlement activity.
                    We felt that he was receptive to this, so McHenry continued to work in New York
                    and we continued to work In Washington to get a consensus on this. We finally
                    did. McHenry was authorized to vote yes for this particular resolution. Well,
                    talk about a backlash. The backlash was immediate. It turned out the Jewish
                    community particularly in New York, were incensed that the United States would
                    vote for something critical of Israel's conduct in Jerusalem. So all of this
                    sort of snowballed over a weekend. President Carter was angry. On Monday morning
                    Vance, Maynes and Saunders were summoned over to the White House. To distance
                    himself, Carter proposed that a statement be issued. Vance agreed. That there
                    had been a failure to communicate. The idea being that Carter did not formally
                    authorize us to vote yes on the resolution, but had wanted us to abstain. The
                    statement had the desired affect, but it was sort of a rebuke to the Department.
                    Well, it was particularly a rebuke to McHenry, Newlin, and Sterner. I have a
                    newspaper article from the Jerusalem Post that went in great detail as to all of
                    the people involved in it and how we had carefully kept any of the Jewish
                    members of the administration in the dark in order to put this shameful thing
                    forward and so forth and so on. I then felt very badly because in retrospect we
                    should not have tried something like this in the middle of a presidential
                    campaign. It was sort of getting towards November and so I went and apologized
                    to Vance. I said, “I am very sorry that we caused this.” He said, “Oh don't
                    worry about it. Don't worry about it at all.” I didn't know that he had already
                    submitted his resignation to Carter over the failed attempt to rescue the
                    hostages in Tehran. That came out a little bit later, but that was the most
                    dramatic thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much did you feel did this IO position, did everything
                        sort of revolve around the Iran hostage thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes. The Iran hostage thing dominated just dominated a great deal of
                    time. Then Bill Maynes then towards the end of the Carter administration, he
                    left I think, to edit Foreign Affairs Magazine. So I became acting assistant
                    secretary of state. Shortly after that, Vance resigned and then Ed Muskie became
                    a very short-lived secretary of state. That turned out to be quite an
                    interesting time when I was the acting assistant secretary. At the very end of
                    the Carter Administration and at the beginning of the Reagan Administration. One
                    of the first things that happened was that the Soviet ambassador, Anatoly
                    Dobrynin, made a courtesy call on Muskie. Because there was some UN problem, the
                    Secretary's staff thought that I should be present, because they thought that
                    this issue would come up. It was fascinating to see Dobrynin in action. He came
                    alone, didn't have a minder with him. He mentioned that he had just driven
                    across the United States to California and showed us pictures of the Grand
                    Canyon and other sites he had seen. Then he started talking about Stalin. He
                    mentioned that Stalin used to sometimes on Sundays invite certain people to his
                    dacha outside of Moscow. When Dobrynin was there, the way things were arranged
                    that you had chairs and a little table, and on the table you had a carafe of
                    vodka and a glass. At one stage Stalin got up and walked across the room to talk
                    to someone. So one of the participants went over and tasted Stalin's vodka while
                    Stalin's back was turned, to see what vodka Stalin was drinking. Stalin came
                    back and said to the man, “How do you like my vodka,” creating sort of an
                    avuncular portrait. It turned out that Stalin's vodka was water. Dobrynin's
                    story showed that he was in the inner circle. Of course during the Kissinger
                    years and even before, Dobrynin had the inside track when it came to being the
                    channel between Washington and inner circles in Moscow. All of that changed
                    immediately when Reagan came in. His car was no longer allowed to drive into the
                    State Department's underground garage and park next to the Secretary's elevator
                    and go right up. All of this was changed then.</p>
                <p>Then immediately when Reagan and George H. W. Bush were sworn in, the first big
                    thing happened to be the release of the hostages. As you remember the Iranians
                    held out until Carter left. After Reagan was sworn in and the hostages were
                    released. Reagan had a large welcoming reception on the south lawn of the White
                    House. Some of us were invited over for that. Then he and Mrs. Reagan gave their
                    first diplomatic reception which was an evening White Tie reception. That set a
                    different tone. This then gave all of us a chance to meet the President and his
                    wife, the Vice President and his wife and the Secretary of State Al Haig. It was
                    quite a very interesting gathering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you feel an immediate change in atmosphere in IO
                        about the negative attitude of at least some of those around Ronald Reagan
                        about the UN because I recall one of the people who was assigned to the UN
                        talking about we wouldn't care if we had to say bye-bye to the UN in New
                        York and that sort of thing. There had been particularly in the right wing
                        talk about the UN and its black helicopters and concentration camps. You
                        know, I mean a real sort of crazy feel about the UN being a secret
                        government. Did you feel any of this from the Reagan people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well nothing that far out. Of course one of the first appointments that
                    he made was Jeane Kirkpatrick was named ambassador to the UN. The first female
                    representative that we had sent to the UN. My own feelings throughout my foreign
                    service career was that I worked for one administration at a time, and while my
                    sympathies might be with the previous administration and its policies, that
                    votes do count and they were in charge. I made it a point to do everything I
                    could to arrange a useful transition. I got along very well with Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick. I briefed her. We prepared briefing books for her. I went up to her
                    hearings on the hill for confirmation. Then I invited her to lunch one day. She
                    said to me, “Mike I appreciate all of this work that you have done and the
                    briefings that you have arranged for me, but,” She said, “all of us in senior
                    positions are being briefed separately by the people that the White House
                    arranges separately.” They were sort of setting up the whole change that was to
                    take place. That was the beginnings and stirrings of Reagan's transformation of
                    American politics. We had never had up until then such an effort to really
                    centralize things. I remember earlier in my career during the Eisenhower
                    Administration at the end of Eisenhower's term the Attorney General was Rogers,
                    William Rogers who was later to come back as Secretary of State. The media asked
                    what are your impressions now, you have had eight years. Rogers said, “How
                    little we could change things.” So now this had been taken to heart by certainly
                    Reagan and the people around him and they were determined to have dedicated
                    loyalists in all senior positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, Reagan had to deal with a Democratic
                        Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, and his first priority as many Republican administrations was a tax
                    cut. So he had to deal with a Democratic Congress. He was the great communicator
                    and he lobbied each and every member of congress. He would call them up from the
                    Oval Office. Tip O'Neill, the speaker of the House of Representatives was
                    surprised at the outcome when Reagan prevailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how long did you stay with IO under the Reagan
                        Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well after a little hiatus, Elliott Abrams was named assistant secretary.
                    I briefed Elliott and we seemingly got along very well together. I found that at
                    that time he was very appreciative. Then one day he called me in and said that
                    the new administration wanted to have their own people in levels not only at the
                    assistant secretary but at the deputy assistant secretary level, and that I
                    would be leaving IO. They chose Nick Platt to replace me. So I cleaned out my
                    desk and the administrative officer found me an office down in the bowels of the
                    Department, and I moved down there. Then Joan Clark, who was then director
                    general of the foreign service, she got a group of us who were in all of this
                    limbo to go over to what was then the Foreign Service Institute to do oral exams
                    of foreign service applicants. I did that for awhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the candidates you were giving
                        oral exams to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Surprisingly good. I thought that at that time they were. We had one
                    woman that was, I think she was ethnically an American Indian. She had done all
                    sorts of things. I thought she was, and the other members of our panel thought
                    she was very good. But the female representative in our group didn't think she
                    was suitable for foreign service material. So we prevailed and said this is just
                    exactly what we are looking for. Then in those days, the Department then I must
                    say the foreign service sort of rallied around all of us. There was talk of my
                    being assigned as ambassador to Algiers. So I thought I was on track to go to
                    Algiers. I found out later that the NEA candidate was Mike Sterner, my previous
                    colleague in the UN vote brouhaha, and that Mike Sterner was finally offered the
                    post.. But then Mike decided for family reasons that they would not go, so that
                    opened up Algiers for me. I must say one of the things that Reagan did was when
                    it was decided that somebody was going to be offered an ambassadorial
                    appointment, Reagan would call them up. So everybody was told now, stay by your
                    phone. There was no advance warning. I went to New York to visit friends, and I
                    went to a matinee of Amadeus. When I came back the whole apartment was in an
                    uproar, “The president called, the president called.” They said, “If you got
                    back before 5:00 you could call the White House, but if you didn't you would
                    just have to wait.” It was after 5:00 but I called the White House, and sure
                    enough Reagan himself came on. I said, “I would be honored to serve you.”</p>
                <p>I went back to the FSI the next day and said, “Well the president called as they
                    said he would.” They asked, “Well how was it?” One of our colleagues was a
                    nervous wreck, time dragged on and he didn't hear anything. He was worried. He
                    was visiting a friend in DC, he was out in the swimming pool. They said, “Hey,
                    the White House is calling.” So he rushed to the phone; by the time he had
                    gotten there they had hung up. Finally, he got the call. The other thing that
                    Reagan did was he had the ambassadors sworn in at the Oval Office. I decided
                    that I would use this as an occasion to make some points. So instead of just
                    some pleasantries I said, “Now Mr. President, you will be going in a week to
                    Cancun, Mexico, for this big economic meeting. Among the people there will be
                    President Bendjedid of Algeria. The Algerians played a key role in the release
                    of our hostages in Tehran. Please do take an occasion to thank him for that.”
                    The administration when they came in, had said, “We don't owe the Algerians
                    anything.” It was very odd. Haig and the others, we don't owe the Algerians
                    anything. Then there was great worry about Reagan even meeting Bendjedid. They
                    thought the Algerians were a bunch of crazy terrorists, and they thought they
                    might try to harm him. Reagan did meet him in Cancun. You had this mixture of
                    Haig as Secretary of State and you had Don Regan as the chief of staff.
                    Apparently nobody ever did a telegram as to what happened there. I kept asking
                    later on , “What is the record of this meeting?” The Department said, “We don't
                    know; we can't find any record that it was made.” So at least I made a point
                    there. Pretty soon then, we were off to Algiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were now in Algeria from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was there from 1981 to '85, late '81 to '85.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in '81 what was sort of the political,
                        economic relations with the U.S. position with Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well we owed the Algerians a tremendous debt of gratitude for their key
                    role in working with the Iranians to get our hostages released. Warren
                    Christopher the Deputy Secretary of State at that time came to Algiers and
                    stayed there while the Algerians negotiated with the Iranians. Complicated
                    issues such as the release of blocked Iranian funds had to be ironed out.</p>
                <p>At the outset of my departure for Algiers to the extent they were aware of
                    Algeria at all, the views of senior members of the new Reagan administration
                    were negative. The Algerian foreign minister had played a major role in
                    resolving the hostage crisis in Tehran. Instead of gratitude, the attitude was
                    the hostage crisis didn't happen on our watch and we don't owe the Algerians
                    anything</p>
                <p>Our policy toward north Africa then was heavily biased toward Morocco and
                    Tunisia. When visiting Morocco with Secretary Haig, Nick Veliotes reported he
                    regarded the Algerians as Nasserites.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived, to meet with Algerian officials I had to send a diplomatic
                    note to the foreign ministry which entailed a long wait. It was not until
                    Bendjedid sent a back channel message to one of President Reagan's friends at a
                    meeting in Paris indicating a desire for better relations did things begin to
                    change. And change they certainly did.</p>
                <p>In Washington they decided to send the station chief from Paris because he was
                    somebody who could speak French fluently, Chuck Cogan, to come and talk to the
                    Algerians about setting up an exchange of intelligence, mainly about Qadhafi. So
                    we had a meeting with Cogan and then a rather large delegation on the side of
                    the Algerians including the chief of military security. This is one of the main
                    posts because President Bendjedid was a military officer, he had been a general.
                    He was chosen when Boumedienne died to be the new man. So he really came out of
                    the military background. The person that had sealed his presidency was then the
                    head of military security. Cogan started off the meeting and made his pitch that
                    it was in our mutual interest, that we had a serious problem with Qadhafi, and
                    that it would be in the interest of both parties if we compared notes. So the
                    head of military security said, “Well, we are a socialist country, and we are
                    unable to collaborate as you suggest.” Then he proceeded to dismiss most of the
                    people on the Algerian side from the room. Once they had left the atmosphere
                    changed and it was sort of let's get down to business. How do you suggest we
                    proceed? Well it turned out that in addition to being the U.S. ambassador I was
                    sort of an ex officio station chief because I became the key contact between the
                    Algerians and the United States. Then I had a very good DCM who helped me.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The DCM was Nat Howell. Nat Howell was an Arabist and spoke Arabic
                    fluently, as well as French. So Nat and I would go get in my private car, not
                    the official car, drive out to a suburb to a safe house. There we would meet
                    with the head of military security. We would then exchange intelligence
                    assessments. Then relations began to improve. It got so that I could call up the
                    chief of staff to President Bendjedid, who was the second most powerful man in
                    Algeria, any time that I had to see the president or if I had something I wanted
                    to pass on and didn't need to see the president, I could see him. I would just
                    drive over, no notes or anything like that.</p>
                <p>My first real coup, the Algerians were so dissatisfied with the Soviets, with
                    their furnishing military equipment to them. The Russians of course provided
                    them with all the heavy military equipment including their aircraft. The MIGs.
                    It was particularly galling to them that the engines of the MIGs had to be flown
                    back to Russia for servicing. They couldn't be serviced in Algiers. They wanted
                    very much to buy our cargo plane the C-130, a propeller driven but wonderful
                    cargo plane. You can land them on a short airfield and take off. So I took up
                    the cudgels and finally I got permission that we could sell them three C-130s.
                    Before the deal could be consummated I found out from Washington the Algerians
                    had shipped some military assistance to Nicaragua, to the Sandinistas. I then
                    bearded the minister of defense and said, “Now look, I went out on a limb on
                    this, and we got it.” He said, “Mr. Ambassador, I assure you this had not been
                    authorized by the central committee and by President Bendjedid. I can promise
                    you that something like this will never happen again, and that we will adhere to
                    the agreement as to how these planes will be used.” So that was the beginning of
                    a new relationship with them in that area, in addition to what was happening
                    then on the intelligence side.</p>
                <p>Then we began to get some high level visits and Secretary Baldridge, the
                    Secretary of Commerce came with a large delegation. We were able to arrange
                    American businessmen meeting with Algerians. Then Baldridge and I wound up
                    having a meeting with President Bendjedid. When we got into his office he was
                    still working on some notes. He then, made a pitch to Baldridge for better
                    U.S.-Algerian relations. Baldridge took that back.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>In the meantime I had re-established contact with my former boss at USUN when I
                    was political counselor there, with George H.W. Bush. Every time I would come
                    back to Washington I would go over to the executive office building and call on
                    him. He would always see me. The first time I went back I called on him. I said,
                    “You know it would be wonderful if you could come to Algiers. They want to have
                    better relations and you could advance the process.” He said, “I would like to
                    do that. I have a memo from my staff assistant that says 'Ambassador Newlin will
                    probably urge you to come to Algiers, and you have this trip lined up for Africa
                    and there is no way Algiers can be fitted into that, so by all means tell him
                    no.'" He read me the memo and said, “However, I would very much like to go to
                    Algiers.” “Can you line up the State Department?” I said, “Well I think I can. I
                    will certainly try.” I went back to the State Department and the African Bureau
                    said, “Absolutely not.” Every minute is accounted for in this trip. So we didn't
                    succeed in that effort. Then every time I went back on business or on leave I
                    would touch base. So finally I was told the vice president was making a trip to
                    Morocco, Algeria and Tunis. So this was a big deal from our standpoint.
                    President Bendjedid went out of his way to invite the Vice President and Barbara
                    Bush to a private luncheon, just the four of them with a translator, with Mrs.
                    Bendjedid and himself. Senior George Bush was able to meet all of the main
                    Algerian officials. That was a big plus for us.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Then I had actually started saying my good byes, my tour was up in the summer of
                    '85. It was a Friday afternoon in Ramadan. Fridays were the Muslim Sunday of
                    course and in summer time everybody was out of town. The phone rang and the
                    operations center from the State Department said, “A TWA airplane has been
                    hijacked from Athens. It is reportedly headed towards Algiers. It will be there
                    momentarily. You are to get in touch with the President of Algeria and ask that
                    they let the plane land. Algeria because of a previous hijacking had said they
                    were not going to let hijacked aircraft land. And get firm assurances that they
                    will not let that airplane take off again.” I did manage to get in touch with my
                    contact, the president's chief of staff. I relayed my instructions. He said,
                    “Well, on humanitarian grounds, we will let the airplane land.” The operations
                    center called and said, “Here is a message that you are to deliver to President
                    Bendjedid immediately.” So I started taking it down. I said to Nat Howell, “Get
                    in the car and go to the airport, the plane will be landing soon. I have got to
                    take down this darn message.” So I remember at one stage I said, “This is far
                    too long.” By the time I got the message written and started having it
                    translated, I left for the airport and got there after the plane just landed.
                    There were two hijackers on board. One of the hijackers who they later called
                    Castro, leaned out the window of the cockpit with a .45 pistol. The Algerians
                    shouted at him, “Get back in that plane; no display of weapons.” Then we heard
                    that there had been a third hijacker who for some reason had not been able to
                    get on the plane in Athens. And that the Greeks were eager to get rid of this
                    individual. They didn't want him incarcerated in Greece. I called the operations
                    center and said, “Well now this may be an opening here that can be used.” They
                    said, “Absolutely no negotiations with the hijackers. You can't talk to the
                    hijackers.” I said, “I am not talking with the hijackers. I am telling you we
                    ought to see if this doesn't present an opening.” So sure enough the Greeks put
                    the third hijacker onboard a plane for Algiers. So then we set up a unit out at
                    the airport with the Algerian negotiators and senior officials and myself and
                    Nat Howell. Sure enough the plane arrived from Athens with the hijacker on board
                    and Greek officials. So the Algerians used that bait to get the women and
                    children released from the plane. I didn't know, I had no idea that they had
                    then agreed the plane could fly to Beirut. So I was greeting the women and the
                    children as they got off the bus from the plane when the plane started up and
                    took off for Beirut. So we took the women and the stewardess to our residence
                    and tried to reassure them that we were going to work on getting everybody
                    released. The stewardess furnished us a report on the hijacking and her
                    description of the hijackers. Well the plane when it landed in Beirut, the
                    hijackers shot and killed a navy seal that they had found from his navy
                    credentials and threw the body out on to the tarmac to show that they were
                    serious. They got several other hijackers to join them and then they flew back
                    to Algiers. The plane was kept at the far end of the runway. Then the Algerians
                    started negotiating with them. Their demands were for release of some prisoners
                    that the Israelis were holding. I think there were 400 of them or something like
                    that. So these negotiations sort of took on a life of their own. Finally, about
                    another third of the passengers were released in Algiers. They were men. In the
                    meantime we began to get word in the media that a delta strike force was being
                    sent to Italy. I was very concerned over that. So I told Washington, “Tell
                    Secretary Shultz that under no circumstances should this strike force try to
                    rescue these people by force. The Algerians will resist and certainly the
                    hijackers will blow up the plane. It will be a disaster.” They said, “Yes, we
                    will pass that on.” So then a couple of days negotiations dragged on, and the
                    Algerians hinted to me that they were about to assure the hijackers that they
                    could arrange for the Israeli prisoners to be released if they would release all
                    of the remaining hostages. I said, “Well I cannot speak to that. I don't know
                    that.” The hijackers could on their own radio hear that the delta force was in
                    Italy. It was early one morning, and we had developed in the embassy the ability
                    to monitor unclassified communications. So I was told that there was a great
                    commotion on the runway and the hijackers were threatening to kill more of the
                    passengers. They got the pilot to say that he was being tortured. I was in touch
                    with my contact urging him not to let the plane take off. The Algerians finally
                    let the plane take off, they did not want Americans killed on the Tarmac in
                    Algiers. That was the end of my involvement in it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the plane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The Plane flew to Beirut and immediately the hostages were dispersed.
                    Then Bob McFarland went to Beirut. It turned out the Israelis were prepared to
                    release the prisoners for their own reasons. So I think that it worked out that
                    finally some prisoners were released as a result of the negotiations that
                    McFarland had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McFarland was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: ...on the National Security Council. I think he was deputy at that
                    particular moment. So all of the hostages were finally released. But thanks to
                    the Algerians it was possible for 2/3 of them to get released in Algiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike, speaking of airplanes and all, were you in Algeria
                        when we bombed Qadhafi and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, I don't think I was at that time. But we did have a successful
                    comparing of notes. The Algerians were worried about Qadhafi. All of our
                    discussions were secret. The other thing that I should mention, the famous
                    General Walters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Vernon Walters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Vernon Walters. Well Vernon Walters was sort of a roving ambassador by
                    that time. He had had many claims and I guess he did speak six or seven
                    languages. Vernon Walters was a very close friend to King Hassan of Morocco. He
                    claimed that in the American invasion of WWII, he had given the young prince a
                    ride in his tank. So he was very close to the king. So close to the king that
                    whenever he would come to Morocco, he would meet with the king privately without
                    the American ambassador present. So Walters, then wanted to be sort of a roving
                    super ambassador to the Maghreb countries. He wanted to include Algiers and
                    Tunisia as well as Morocco. I was very happy to see Walters. He was certainly an
                    extraordinary individual, but I was not about to have happen in Algiers what had
                    happened in Rabat. So I was very keen that Walters did not get involved in the
                    kind of liaison work that I was doing. He respected that. President Bendjedid
                    always received him when he came, and we arranged for him to meet top officials
                    with me present.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>The capstone to my assignment to Algiers was when I got word from the Department
                    that a state visit slot in the spring of '85 had come open. The person they were
                    trying to have couldn't come, so therefore they were inviting President
                    Bendjedid to come. Well now if you want to ever live high on the hog, you want
                    to be part of a state visit, particularly with the Reagan administration. So my
                    wife and I were members of the official delegation of course. We couldn't stay
                    at the Blair House because that was being renovated, but we had the top floor of
                    the Madison Hotel. Everything went off beautifully. 21 gun reception on the
                    south lawn, the state dinner and meetings in the oval office as well as the
                    family quarters. After that, President Bendjedid went to California. He visited
                    San Francisco as well as Los Angeles. That all went very well. Before the formal
                    meeting in the oval office, I went over with Secretary Shultz and Arnie Raphel
                    who was acting assistant secretary for NEA. We drove in the back gate of the
                    White House and got out and started going through the rabbit warren the White
                    House is on the ground floor. As we got to the main floor, Shultz and Arnie
                    Raphel were nabbed by somebody in an office that wanted to talk to them. The
                    military officer that was escorting us kept going. I thought I had better keep
                    up with him. I kept going until I got to a small office that had two secretaries
                    in it. Then a door out of the wall opened and out came Ronald Reagan. Reagan was
                    such an actor. He had met me before, but he didn't remember. I said, “Mr.
                    President, I am Mike Newlin. I am your ambassador to Algiers. Secretary Shultz
                    is right behind me. He will be here in just a minute.” He acted as though he was
                    so delighted to meet me, that it made his day. It was perfect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Algerians react to this opening to the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It was controversial. But the people that he had, his closest advisors
                    and everything at that time were in favor. It was sort of a half-life of Sadat.
                    Remember Sadat got fed up with the Russians too. He said, “If you get involved
                    with the Russians they will grab you by the throat.” It was particularly true on
                    the military thing. This was a little bit of that. Of course earlier even in the
                    days under Boumedienne, George Shultz built their liquefied natural gas plant
                    and infrastructure. In the Sahara gas fields I was shown a small house that was
                    called the Shultz villa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did, were the Algerians impressed with anything or
                        just the things they say? Had they any idea of the United States would you
                        say at the top level? I mean the United States is a big country, and for
                        people who have lived in Algiers they have gone to France. I mean it is a
                        different thing. Did you feel they were getting a pretty good picture of the
                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think the top echelons were pretty much clued in. I do think that there
                    was this residual revolutionary background and third world kind of thing. Some
                    of that was no doubt in the background. But President Bendjedid managed to make
                    a very good impression on President Reagan. In their meeting in the Oval Office,
                    they had developed an interesting convoluted understanding that they would try
                    to help with the other hostages being held in Beirut. I would receive messages
                    and they would forward them to Beirut. But because they were dealing with
                    Hezbollah and these people, while they tried, they were not able to do anything
                    in that department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Polisario movement confrontation in Morocco
                        intrude while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It didn't because the Algerians, while they had a formal position of
                    support for Polisario self determination in southern Sahara, did not really stir
                    up things. I did get permission for Nat Howell to go to the southern Sahara and
                    to actually meet with some of the Polisario people, but that did not become a
                    major issue. It was an issue for me when I first got there because Walters said
                    that there was the Qadhafi trail through Algeria, that the Qadhafi trail started
                    in Tripoli and went across the southern Sahara to the Polisario. I had a hard
                    time confronting him on that. I finally got him off that tack. But he was so
                    hipped on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Algerian foreign
                        ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Superb. Absolutely superb. The foreign minister that had played the key
                    role with Warren Christopher in the release of our hostages in Tehran, his plane
                    had crashed on a trip to central Africa. They first announced that everybody had
                    been killed. He survived, but he was seriously handicapped as a result. But he
                    was very capable. Then after I was there for several months, I got a call from
                    somebody in the foreign ministry at night at home saying that he was on his way
                    to Tehran in an Algerian plane, and that the plane was overdue. Could we check
                    with airports in the area in case the plane had made an emergency landing. So I
                    got in touch with the operations center and said, “Check at these airports and
                    see if an Algerian plane has landed there.” Well it turned out the Iraqis had
                    mistakenly shot the plane down with everybody on board. So then they had a new
                    foreign minister, I think Ibrahimi. He was very good. He made I think, a very
                    good impression in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the French Algerian connection
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: They were condemned to cooperate. I don't think the life of the French
                    ambassador was always a happy one, but obviously so many Algerians were in
                    France of course. Later on, after I left, I think relations did improve, and I
                    think Chirac actually made a visit to Algiers. But the French, there were so
                    many wounds and everything left. The other thing that happened that was sort of
                    a cloud on the horizon was the growth of Moslem sentiment while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The extreme, the fundamentalist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The fundamentalist. Algeria was ostensibly a secular socialist state,
                    with respect for all religions. Certainly the Catholic church was able to
                    operate and so forth. But I noticed while I was there, we used to go up to the
                    Atlas Mountains to a wonderful place called Chr�a during the weekend for a
                    picnic. We went through a town called Blida which is right at the base of the
                    mountains. There was a rather small mosque to one side of the road. When we
                    first were there for the first couple of years, we would drive up on Friday.
                    There would be men in the mosque and out in the courtyard. By the time we left
                    there were so many people they were out on both sides of the road and almost
                    closing the road. So this was a sign of things changing. Then, of course, after
                    I left, they had a reasonably free and fair election where the fundamentalist
                    party won. Then the military stepped in and cancelled the result of the
                    election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations with Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think the relations were proper. The Tunisians were not very much of a
                    factor. Bendjedid did meet with Hassan of Morocco while I was there. They made
                    nice noises about how they were going to cooperate and everything, but I don't
                    think anything came of it. One coup that I had was that we heard early morning
                    on the radio that Qadhafi was going to meet with Hassan, and they were going to
                    unify their two countries. So I fired off a flash message to Washington saying,
                    “Guess what is happening. There is going to be unity between...” This caught the
                    embassy in Rabat by surprise. During my stay I did manage to have very good
                    relations with my counterpart, Joseph Verner Reed in Rabat. He was
                    delightful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also had the reputation of being absolutely captivated
                        and almost a captive of the Moroccan court. I mean I think there is
                        something about he would refer to our king or something like that. I mean
                        this is sort of a, I won't say a laughing stock of the foreign service, but
                        considered a bad case of clientitis.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well as a result of this report, and after the meeting took place between
                    Qadhafi and Hassan, then Joseph got his marching orders to go see the king. So I
                    got a blow by blow of this from Joseph later. He went, I guess the king was
                    maybe in Marrakech at that time, so he went to Marrakech. The King had a special
                    van, royal van with two facing seats. I guess they rode all the way back to
                    Rabat while Joseph delivered his message about this extraordinary
                    development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the message?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I guess expressing surprise and warning the king that he had better watch
                    his step.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I mean when this thing was announced, in the first
                        place you know, it is almost laughable. You wonder how King Hassan got into
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I don't know what his idea was for that. Maybe to show the Algerians that
                    he was going to try to play a wider role in the Maghreb. I don't know what his
                    thinking was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody take it seriously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes because we had been through this with Nasser before
                        with Syria and Yemen. We had already gone through the United Arab Republic
                        and this sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Futile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, these gestures. Nationality takes over very
                        quickly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well just to finish up on this, what was life like? How
                        did you find, I have always heard Algerians were rather dour people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: They could have that reputation. They had been through a lot. The French
                    pulled out I guess in '60 or '61 overnight. They had never done anything to
                    educate any of the Algerians or any of bring them into the administration. They
                    were just left empty handed. The French took with them the maps of the electric
                    and the sewage grid and much other useful material. The Algerians were thrown
                    into a very difficult situation. The Algerians were not fortunate in having Ben
                    Bella as the leader of opposition to French colonialism, his airplane had been
                    commandeered by the French. He was in prison for quite some time, so therefore
                    he was the national hero. The Algerian elite got together and caucused after the
                    French left, and they decided, this was at the height of the non aligned
                    movement, they would become a socialist country and they would be non aligned.
                    They would be with Nasser and Nkrumah and all of those people. They did start to
                    develop their infrastructure. They did bring in the United States to develop
                    their sizable natural gas reserves. But they adopted a fairly radical brand of
                    nonalignment. At one time they had Stokely Carmichael in Algiers as sort of an
                    unofficial American representative. They broke diplomatic relations with us of
                    course after the Six Day War, the '67 Six Day War. So we didn't have formal
                    diplomatic relations. We had in effect a mission there, but under the Spanish
                    flag.</p>
                <p>They let agriculture which had been the breadbasket of France collapse. The
                    French plantations were wonderful, wine and wheat and all these things. They
                    tried to socialize it. They would go out and tell illiterate peasants, “You and
                    the people own this now. This is going to be communal property. The state will
                    provide seeds and things.” The peasants grew just enough for their families.
                    Prices, everything had to be imported practically. We were supposed to change
                    our money legally. I think the United States and the British embassy were the
                    only ones that changed their money at the official rate. So when the foreign
                    service inspectors came, by that time the foreign service inspectors were not
                    allowed to accept embassy hospitality. Previously the ambassador would have said
                    come stay at the residence. No, they had to go to an Algerian hotel. They had to
                    eat on the Algerian economy. So we met them and sent them to the hotel. They
                    came the next morning to the embassy and said, “Something is very wrong here.
                    Either this post is not reporting to Washington what the cost is here or
                    Washington is not providing an adequate offset.” So that was fine. My
                    predecessor's wife opened the snack bar. That was one of the few places the
                    diplomatic community liked to come, to the American snack bar. Decent food at
                    reasonable prices. Just before the inspectors arrived the administrative officer
                    said, “Well I am sorry, Ramadan is coming up and we have to close the snack
                    bar.” I said, “but the inspectors are coming. You can't close it.” He said, “I
                    cannot have Algerians cooking and serving food all day when they can't even have
                    a sip of water.” So I said, “All right, close the snack bar.” After a day or two
                    of hotel food the inspectors decided they would go to the market. They looked
                    around at prices and everything. Finally they bought a watermelon about the size
                    of a basketball for $15.00. We got our allowances improved as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about socializing with them? Were there any
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, there was not. I would have no problem getting ministers, for example
                    the minister of petroleum or the commerce minister to come to the residence
                    whenever we had official delegations. It was sort of funny though. Bendjedid I
                    don't think was a fundamentalist, but he did not drink alcohol. So at official
                    receptions, the Algerians would always take soft drinks until the senior
                    minister arrived. If the senior minister ordered a scotch and soda, then it was
                    all right to have scotch and soda. We had a rather feisty Algerian member of our
                    staff. She advised my wife, “One thing you ought to serve are these delicious
                    dates wrapped with bacon.” My wife said, “Bacon? Would the Algerians eat that?”
                    She said, “Oh they would love it.” So she offered some to the petroleum minister
                    and he said in French, “You are an Algerian and you are serving bacon?” She
                    said, “Well you are drinking scotch.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there in 1985, what for Mike
                        Newlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I got a telephone call from my friend Joan Clark who was by then
                    assistant secretary of state for consular affairs. She wanted me to come to
                    Washington to be her principal deputy. I had thought maybe that Walters, who by
                    that time had been designated as our UN representative in New York, I thought
                    that he might want to have me as his deputy, but he wanted to have Herb Okun
                    instead. So I jumped at the chance to go to Washington. I didn't regret my
                    choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Washington. .How long were you in consular
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what did you do after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: After that I was ambassador to the UN agencies in Vienna, my final post,
                    which included the IAEA and UNRA and a number of others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay so we will pick this up next time in 1985 when you
                        are going to consular affairs 1985 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: 1985 that would be three years, to 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 13 December 2006. Mike how did you get over to
                        consular affairs and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Before we get into that, I would like to add a foot note to the time I
                    was Ambassador to Algiers. Remember we talked at the very end I was about to
                    leave when the hijacking of TWA 847 occurred. I would like to have this message
                    recorded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am going to read this here. This is message for
                        ambassador and staff from the Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dear Ambassador Newlin, I would like to take this opportunity now that our
                    hostages have been released to thank you and your entire staff at embassy
                    Algiers for your excellent work during the hostage crisis. Your efforts and
                    talent contributed substantially to the safe release of our citizens. I would
                    like to extend my appreciation both personally, on behalf of the United States
                    government and people for your assistance. Sincerely yours, George Shultz.</p>
                <p>He was the Secretary of State. This is dated July 1, 1985. Very good.</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That was very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also does show the role, there is no, you are not just
                        a creature of Washington with somebody pushing buttons and you deliver
                        messages. Some people don't understand what ambassadors do. I mean you are
                        put on the ground and all of a sudden there you are, and it is your problem.
                        It is your common sense. It is your ability to deal with it and the people
                        on the ground that you have been working with all along that pay off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK consular affairs. How did you get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was at the end of a three year tour. I described earlier how the
                    Department works from the point of view of the geographic bureaus. While I was
                    in Algiers, I got my instructions except during the hostage crisis through the
                    bureau of near eastern affairs. NEA had no further use for my services in their
                    bailiwick since they had to fight for their Arabists. So I began to cast around.
                    I had thought that maybe Vernon Walters who had been named ambassador to the UN
                    could use a DCM in New York. So I sort of sounded him out on this. It turned out
                    he had long known Herb Okun, and he wanted Herb Okun for that. I was basically
                    looking for something when all of a sudden Joan Clark who had been director
                    general of the foreign service called me up. She was then assistant secretary
                    for consular affairs. She wanted me to come and be the principal deputy
                    assistant secretary in consular affairs, so I agreed to that. I had a very
                    interesting three years in consular affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will come to sort of the substance of what you were
                        doing, but first, did you talk a bit about working for Joan Clark who was a
                        major figure in the State Department in her era, and how she dealt with
                        consular affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Joan was one of the first women in the State Department who by sheer
                    ability rose through the ranks. I had known her off and on for years when she
                    was in personnel. Then she went on to other things. She is a superb manager as
                    well as somebody who as director general of the foreign service, you have to
                    handle a pretty prickly bunch of people. She did that extremely well. She really
                    pushed CA, Consular Affairs into the modern world. We got machine readable
                    passports. You no longer have to write down numbers of passports. The whole visa
                    process was automated as well. You could do an electronic name check when
                    somebody applied for a visa to see if there was any negative information on that
                    person or whether they had shopped around for a visa in other places. Now these
                    were major accomplishments in easing the consular worldwide workload. Then she
                    also modernized the business about travel advisories. Whenever you want to know
                    is it safe to go to Bhutan or is it safe to go to Azerbaijan, you can call the
                    State Department and get the latest recommendation as to whether you should
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the world wide web was available. Now you
                        can tickle the keys on the internet. It is basically the same thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That is right, it is basically the same thing. These were just a few of
                    the things that she accomplished while she was there. She was so competent and
                    knowledgeable. Of course you have to have knowledge of all of the legislation
                    pertaining to immigration and visas and passports and that type of thing. She
                    ran this huge bureau that generated quite a lot of money. Unfortunately the
                    money for passports and visas didn't go, it went to the Treasury. Joan was also
                    highly respected on Capitol Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember back in 1977 I was consul general in Seoul,
                        Korea. We had zero based budgeting. I was able to say my section we were
                        able to generate, we actually had a surplus of money. How about your other
                        sections, your political section or economic section. How did you all
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: So it was a privilege to work closely with Joan. Typically she would say
                    when I am away, you are in charge, Mike. You make the decisions you think are
                    correct, and when I come back there is not going to be any sort of second
                    guessing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me before we move to some of the other things. You
                        have several almost not really autonomous units. You have got passports, you
                        have got visas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: You have got protection of American Services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American services, protection of Americans. All of these
                        sort of have traditionally been little dukedoms and all. I was wondering how
                        you put this together plus the fact that some of the assistant secretaries
                        had special assistants who also have sort of power because of their
                        connection to the Assistant secretary or something. You are kind of like the
                        DCM. How did you find this running herd, sort of like herding beagles or
                        something like this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well that is very well put. Yes you did have particularly I would say on
                    the passport side and to a certain extent maybe on the visa side too, you had
                    sort of fiefdoms. They resented sometimes what they considered to be
                    micromanagement from the assistant secretary's office. But Joan was still able
                    to get her views known and respected. There was no question as to whom was in
                    overall charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well who were you dealing with say in the passport office?
                        For years that had been Frances Knight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That was Frances Knight oh good heavens yes. She was really the Secretary
                    of State for passports. Her word was law. Whoever you were, you didn't cross
                    Frances Knight.</p>
                <p>Vern Penner was the deputy assistant secretary for passports. Occasionally there
                    would be resistance to something they wanted to go one way and she wanted to go
                    another, but she always managed to prevail. Joan did have, you are right, she
                    did have a special assistant, Phyllis Busco, who had worked closely with her in
                    personnel and as director general. As far as the direction of the bureau was
                    concerned, it was sort of a troika with Joan, Phyllis and myself. We all worked
                    very closely together. Joan told me from the beginning that I would know
                    everything that she knew, and that was a big help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well looking at this, I am an old consular hand from way
                        back. You have Joan who was basically personnel, Phyllis Busco who came up
                        through personnel ranks, and you through the political officer ranks. Who
                        the hell knew anything about consular work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well we all had a lot to learn. And we depended, I mean we had Vern
                    Penner whenever something came up about passports, he would tell us what the law
                    was. Also I will get to it later on, we had to testify before Congress whenever
                    immigration bills or anything to do with consular affairs came up in one of the
                    committees on the hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did you, I mean you had the episode, now it came
                        later, the Tamposi thing came after you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes, thank heaven. That would never have happened on Joan's watch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the historical record you might explain what the
                        Tamposi thing was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well after Joan left, the Reagan administration replaced her with a
                    political appointee, Ms. Tamposi. I think she was from New Hampshire. She knew
                    Sununu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sununu was George Bush senior's chief of staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well Tamposi came in, and Sununu noted that the Clinton candidacy was a
                    threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was towards the end of the George Herbert Walker Bush
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Towards the very end, getting towards election time. So Sununu asked
                    Tamposi to have someone search through the passport files, application files of
                    Clinton. This is something that clearly was way out of line. It was a
                    political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Clinton had been opposed to the Vietnam war, had been
                        at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. There was a rumor saying that he had tried to
                        renounce his citizenship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well these were all part of a political pot boiling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They might catch him with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. So Tamposi asked one of the professional hands in consular affairs
                    to get Clinton's file and see if there was any negative things in there that
                    would interest Sununu. Then somebody told the media about this, and this became
                    a really big problem. As a result of it, Tamposi was fired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well let's come back to your time there. What did you
                        see as sort of the main focus of what you were trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: The main focus was trying to help Joan manage this very large important,
                    one of the largest bureaus in the department when you consider all of the
                    consular officers worldwide. So we covered the entire spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find were you getting a lot of pressure about
                        visas either to issue them or not to issue more?NEWLIN: Oh all the time
                        there were pressures particularly after the Tehran hostage thing and the
                        fall of the Shah. There were plenty of applications of people that had fled
                        right after the fall of the Shah or before, who wanted to come to the United
                        States, and there was constant pressure. Most of them wanted to emigrate.
                        That was a long process. Then they wanted to come on visitors visas. There
                        was a real worry that these people had no intention of ever leaving the
                        United States. So this was typical. You got calls from Congressmen's offices
                        that people put pressure on them to get the State Department to issue visas.
                        So this was just one example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok let's take this. You get a call from a congressman,
                        probably his personal staff. How did you handle this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well you would call up the assistant secretary for visas and say look
                    into this. This person is applying and give us your analysis of eligibility. It
                    would come back and usually I would handle this kind of thing. I would then call
                    up the person, the staffer, that had made the request and explain that the State
                    Department did not believe this was a completely legitimate request. Usually
                    that would do it. Sometimes we would get a letter from a Congressman. That had
                    to be answered in writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well were there any that you recall particularly
                        troublesome either individual visa cases or generic visa cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well we did have some problems. In Manila the consul general there had
                    sort of gone native and he ran everything personally. He had managed to become
                    friends with Imelda Marcos so he was in a social circle with her and her
                    husband. He would then have people come to the embassy and go in through a door
                    that they could come into his suite of offices, and he would handle all of these
                    things personally rather than having them apply normally. So this became
                    something of a problem. Joan sent me out to look into it. I came to the
                    conclusion that this was something out of control and very wrong. By that time
                    the ambassador had left and we had a charg� d'affairs at that time, who also was
                    concerned about the matter and didn't know quite how to handle it. So I came
                    back and recommended to Joan that he should be relieved of his duties. To her
                    credit she agreed. Then he immediately came back to Washington and appealed to
                    her and said that he would like a transfer. I sat in on that meeting, just the
                    three of us. Joan said, “Well I have a problem with that.” So he went back to
                    Manila, and by that time Mike Armacost had become the ambassador. Armacost
                    reviewed my reporting and Joan's view on this, and so Armacost decided that he
                    would make a recommendation that the employee be separated for the way he had
                    handled this situation. The individual concerned got a lawyer, a local lawyer.
                    There were meetings with Armacost and the lawyer and the individual. Finally the
                    Department backed up both Joan and the ambassador. He was in fact separated in
                    Manila. But then his friendship with the Marcoses paid off. He went into
                    business in Manila, and apparently financially did very well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, he is dead now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If somebody wants another view of this case, I am doing an
                        interview with Larry Colbert right now who was a deputy under him and who
                        was very unhappy. I mean we all knew there was a problem. I mean as a
                        consular officer, you know this is a rather blatant thing. The man was
                        apparently a superb manager too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a very difficult job in Manila, probably the most
                        difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He went native.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went native and he got too... We had another problem
                        later on with another consul general there who was overly friendly with some
                        ladies. I mean it is a real benevolence. I mean I had a bit of this dealing
                        with a lot of corruption. I was consul general in Seoul, and we had a lot of
                        long faces and counterfeit documents. You woke up wondering if another ring
                        had formed before we had broken up the first one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It is so true. Another example of the problem were non immigrant visas in
                    Moscow. The embassy in Moscow is an old apartment building converted. Outside
                    this embassy there would be these hordes of people trying to get in line to
                    apply for visas. It wouldn't be appropriate to try to use marine guards, so we
                    hired local Russians to maintain order who were probably KGB officers. And of
                    course they were taking bribes and everything. If you wanted to go to the head
                    of the line you would go up and talk to them. So this caused another set of
                    problems that was very difficult to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I mean this is, the unfortunate thing is consular
                        affairs particularly the visa business, I mean it is the only thing, you
                        might say the only negotiable item that embassies or consulates have. This
                        is something people really want. I mean it speaks to the attraction of the
                        United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, that's right. I found that out. You probably have had the same
                    experience. On my first post as a vice consul issuing first of all non immigrant
                    visas in Frankfurt in 1952. So people would meet me at social functions and say,
                    “Oh we are having a dinner dance tomorrow night. Won't you come,” and so forth.
                    Then others would say, “I own a vineyard down in the Rhineland, and I would like
                    to have you come down for wine tasting,” and this kind of thing. This was all
                    the time. The consul general at that time was just wonderful. That was Mr.
                    Chetwynd Montagu deRenzy Pigott.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: And Mr. Pigott said to me, “Mike, I don't want you doing any favors
                    whatsoever to any of these applicants. I mean you decide it based on the
                    guidance and instructions of the Department.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well back to consular affairs, what about during the time
                        you were there, what about protection of American citizens? Were there any
                        major problems you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: A major problem during my tenure in CA was the Americans who were held in
                    Beirut. I became the CA point man and among other things I led interagency team
                    debriefings when one would be released. We did have another type of problem,
                    that is when the Reagan Administration came in, his name is Gary Bauer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He was one of the ones nursing a desire to run for president. He wanted
                    to push a ban on anyone with AIDS getting a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, HIV. This would mean testing all of your visa applicants for AIDS.
                    You can imagine the problems this would cause with other governments who would
                    then say all Americans had to be tested before they could get a visa. I
                    participated in quite a series of discussions over this. It never did come to
                    pass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was the first, the thought being that if we kept
                        this infection out of the United States. It was a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh it was a problem but with hundreds of thousands of people applying for
                    visas it was not a practical idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about American visitors abroad? How were things going
                        with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: I am glad to say that they were handled very well. This was before, well
                    of course, we had had at the very end or during the Carter administration, we
                    had the question of all of our hostages in Tehran. But that was sort of the
                    beginning then of something that I was involved in later while I was in consular
                    affairs of the hostages that were taken in Beirut. So I can speak to that. When
                    I was in Algiers we had one American prisoner who during the early 60's, during
                    the resistance to the French, had carried a bomb and delivered it to an
                    Algerian. Fortunately the bomb did not go off and kill anyone. He got on a ship
                    and was on his way to Spain. The Algerians found out about the bomb, found out
                    about who had gotten it, so they had the ship turn around and come back. This
                    man was sentenced to death, but then he was sentenced to life imprisonment in
                    Constantine. We had the chief of the consular section visit him every so often.
                    Eventually I managed to persuade the Algerians to release him because he was no
                    danger to anybody. This was, that particular thing of visiting prisoners to see
                    how they were, and making sure they are not being mistreated was an important
                    part of our service to American citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have, I am thinking of Mexico but these exchange of
                        prisoner programs or had that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No. There was at that time a major problem as there had been for years
                    with illegals crossing the border. So Joan asked me to go with the head of
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service to Mexico. I went with him, and we met
                    with the President of Mexico. He was very frank with us. He said, “We both have
                    this major problem that Mexico has been unable to produce enough jobs to keep
                    people from wanting to go illegally to the United States. We are working on
                    this, and we ask your forbearance.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations with Immigration and Naturalization
                        Service during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: They were businesslike. We got along, I think both Joan and myself got
                    along very well with our opposite numbers in INS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem of getting good consular officers to
                        stay in the consular side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Really there wasn't. When I would go abroad on consular business, it was
                    a lot of time the consular officer who would be my control officer. We had
                    really in general superb managers in posts abroad. One obvious case was this one
                    that we mentioned earlier, but in general we did not have problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of problems, what about Beirut? Because this
                        later became the Iran Contra affair.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: I had a brush with Iran Contra. Up until this particular incident,
                    Secretary Shultz had been aware earlier of Bud McFarland who was the head of the
                    NSC, had mentioned to him or had let him know that there was a possibility of
                    working with the Iranians to get our hostages released, and that the Iranians
                    were interested in some arms shipments. Shultz said, “Absolutely not. We should
                    never have anything to do with that.” Our policy was we will not talk or deal
                    with terrorism, and we had a policy during the Iran Iraq war which was going on,
                    that we would not sell arms to either side. We were asking our allies not to do
                    that as well. I got involved, I don't remember just how. But when one of our
                    hostages in Beirut would be released I would head up an inter departmental
                    working group, and go to Frankfurt where they would come. They would be released
                    in Beirut. They would go overland to Damascus, and then they would be flown to
                    Wiesbaden to the air force hospital there where they would be debriefed and have
                    a physical.</p>
                <p>I was cutting the grass one Sunday afternoon in the front yard, and I got a
                    telephone call from the State Department. They said, “David Jacobsen has been
                    released in Beirut. We want you to leave tonight with the team. Please show up
                    at Andrews Air Force Base as soon as you can.” So I did. This was the first time
                    that Shultz really smelled a rat, because all of this happened two days before
                    the mid term elections on November 2, 1986. A White House draft statement was
                    brought over to him, hand carried, that spoke of Hostages, plural, being
                    released. Somebody had struck out the “s” on Hostages. So whoever was running
                    this operation had expected all of the hostages being held or at least more than
                    one would be released. So on November 3, there was a newspaper article, Al
                    Shiraa in Beirut which reported that there had been a secret trip to Tehran by
                    McFarland to talk to the Iranians about release of our hostages. Then that
                    sensational report was followed by a statement by Rafsanjani, the speaker of
                    Iran's parliament, who revealed that yes indeed, McFarland did come to Tehran in
                    September of '86 with four others carrying military equipment. Clearly a swap of
                    arms for hostages. Carrying military equipment which had been purchased from
                    international arms dealers. Rafsanjani said they were traveling with Irish
                    passports. They carried with them a Bible signed by Reagan, and they also had a
                    chocolate cake with it. Immediately this set off all sorts of alarm bells. When
                    they brought me the telegram in Wiesbaden with the Al Shiraa thing, the person
                    who gave it to me said, “Look at this. Isn't this the most ridiculous thing in
                    the world.” I said, “Well it is so bizarre I think there might be something to
                    it.” The next day Rafsanjani's bomb came out. Immediately the media picked up on
                    all of this. Shultz let it be known immediately that he was opposed to any sort
                    of arms for hostages deal. The media said the White House has made a deal with
                    the terrorists, and Shultz was cut out of the action. Shultz was horrified, and
                    he thought this had the possibility of becoming another Watergate.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>In the Nixon administration he was Secretary of the Treasury, and he had resigned
                    over a point of issue. It didn't have anything to do with this, but he had
                    resigned rather than go along with something Nixon wanted to do. But he had seen
                    what Watergate had done to destroy the Nixon presidency, and he was very
                    concerned that this had the potential to do this to Reagan Shultz called
                    Poindexter who at that time had replaced McFarland as national Security Advisor
                    and said we had to give complete facts to the public right then. Poindexter
                    refused. He said this would complicate efforts to secure the release of other
                    hostages and would prevent maybe the establishment of a correct relationship
                    with Iran. I got to Wiesbaden before Jacobsen. There is a small airport at that
                    time, military airport, near the hospital which was separate from the big Rhine
                    Main airport. I went out with some members of my team. A Lear Jet with Swiss
                    markings landed. I went out to the plane, and when I got into the cabin there
                    was Jacobsen and there was Terry Waite who was a representative of the
                    Archbishop of Canterbury who was working on hostages release. There also was
                    Oliver North. North said, “I am not here.” So we talked briefly. The media was
                    up in a grandstand. We agreed that Jacobsen should confine himself to talking
                    about his situation as a hostage, and his release, but not get into any other
                    areas. So we walked over to the media. We went then to the Wiesbaden hospital
                    where he had a physical and the debriefings started. The people doing the
                    debriefing, from his descriptions of his confinement, he thought he heard
                    airplanes, and he thought that they were near the sea. So the people doing the
                    debriefing thought that they could pinpoint where in Beirut he had been held. So
                    CIA then was tasked to go to this particular place they thought the other
                    hostages might be being held. It turned out that wasn't accurate. So after the
                    debriefing then finally Jacobsen held a rather bizarre press conference. We were
                    on a big balcony at the hospital, and the media was down below, including Pierre
                    Salinger. Jacobsen meandered and meandered but he didn't get into anything that
                    would indicate he was knowledgeable about what had led to his release. So after
                    two or three days of the debriefings and these other things, we got into a plane
                    and went to Washington.</p>
                <p>We were immediately whisked into the White House and we found ourselves in the
                    cabinet room with the President and Nancy Reagan and some others. The press was
                    all outside in the rose garden waiting for Jacobsen and the President to come
                    out. I could tell there was a tremendous amount of tension, particularly
                    Jacobsen talking with Nancy Reagan and the President. Then soon Ollie North came
                    in and joined that group. Then Jacobsen and the President went out, and Jacobsen
                    took the line that the press ought to just back off. Back off, your focusing on
                    these hostages is causing difficulties for the hostages and efforts to get them
                    released. After that then my time with Jacobsen was over.</p>
                <p>I then was involved with other hostages later. There was the release of Father
                    Jenco and Father Jenco's extended family all wanted to go to Wiesbaden to meet
                    him. Then they decided they wanted to go to the Vatican with him. Then we had
                    this great group of Jencos going around and finally they met the President at
                    the White House. I was told that my job was now to inform the Jenco clan that
                    Father Jenco was going back to his order in Chicago and U.S. financial and other
                    government participation was over.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get called by the Iran-Contra Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Fortunately I didn't. They had no idea that I was involved. All of this
                    is explained in great detail by Shultz in his magnificent book Turmoil and
                    Triumph. He goes over his battles that he had that went on for months and
                    months. Reagan had a blind spot. One thing that Shultz and Cap Weinberger,
                    Secretary of Defense, agreed on was that these arms for hostage deals were just
                    absolutely dynamite, and that our constant assurances, statements by people,
                    that there was no such thing going on was going to come to haunt us. He would
                    participate in Meetings with others where Shultz and Weinberger would say this
                    is a violation of our policies and possibly our laws to go into this kind of a
                    thing with arms for hostages. Reagan would say, “This isn't arms for hostages.
                    This isn't arms for hostages. We are just trying to establish good relations
                    with the Iranians. We have a chance now that Khomeini is gone to establish good
                    relations with them.” Time after time Shultz would think he had turned this
                    thing off, and then find out that it was still going on. It wasn't until Meese
                    was asked to investigate a rumor that the proceeds from these hostage arms sales
                    to Iran had been diverted to the Contras in Nicaragua who were fighting the
                    Sandinistas, that the whole thing really blew up. Shultz went and met with the
                    President. The President said, “I am dumbfounded. I had no idea this was going
                    on.” So Poindexter was sent back to the Navy and Oliver North was sent back to
                    the Marines. The whole thing was then, but then there were these hearings on
                    Capitol Hill where Shultz was magnificent. He told the whole story there, and
                    then finally at a press conference, Reagan said, “I said earlier there were no
                    arms for hostages in our contacts.” He said, “In going over the record it
                    appears that this operation deteriorated, and I now know that this was not
                    correct what I said, and that there were arms shipments.” He had been told
                    repeatedly by Shultz what Poindexter and North were really doing but he was so
                    focused on the hostages that he had a blind spot. Amazing story that at one
                    stage the Israelis were involved in this. The Israelis would then provide 200
                    TOW anti tank weapons from their stocks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Target on wire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Target on wire. The Israelis would then provide this, and these would be
                    the things that would then be taken to Tehran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point Iran and Iraq were waging a terrific
                        war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: A war, and people were horrified. Bremer was going around the world
                    trying to buck up people not to provide arms to either side, and here we were
                    doing this. Then the Israelis would then ask us to restock their TOWs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know essentially if you had American citizens being
                        held by some group in a foreign country, this is the responsibility of
                        consular affairs, but was this sort of taken out of your hands? I mean did
                        the White House say let us handle this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well there was an attempt made in the Jacobsen debriefing by CIA to
                    hijack the reporting. We had clear guidelines as to how the reporting was to be
                    done. It was to be done in State Department channels, top secret, with other
                    code words to restrict the distribution. One of the people on the delegation who
                    probably was from CIA, and William Casey the head of CIA was the one in
                    government that was involved with McFarland first and then with Poindexter and
                    Oliver North and others.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: This individual came to me and said, “The information that Jacobsen is
                    providing is so sensitive that we have got to compartmentalize this.” And he
                    said then, “We will send Jacobsen's testimony dealing with highly sensitive
                    information through CIA channels, and then other aspects of it that are not so
                    sensitive can go.” I said, “Absolutely not.” I said, “We are going to adhere to
                    the agreed reporting procedure.” He said, “Well this is what Washington wants.”
                    I said, “Fine. When I get instructions from the State Department that this is
                    what I am to do, then we will then compartmentalize. But until then we are going
                    to send it the way we have agreed.” The instruction never arrived of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well by 1988, I take it that with this particular thing,
                        things are going pretty well. I mean there were no particular things. How
                        about aircraft hijackings or ambassadors being kidnapped or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well you know Reg Bartholomew's embassy was blown up in Beirut. Then
                    there was the case of the Achille Lauro, the cruise ship that was hijacked. Then
                    we had an American citizen, Klinghoffer, who was in a wheel chair, and he was
                    assassinated and thrown overboard. His body was later recovered. So it became my
                    duty to go to New York to represent the United States at the funeral and the
                    arrival of the body and for the funeral. I, then, had to read on national
                    television a statement from the President expressing our condolences and our
                    assurances that we would make every effort to apprehend the people that had done
                    this and see that they were brought to justice. The Egyptians, when the Achille
                    Lauro came to Alexandria and the Egyptians arrested the hijackers and then
                    released the rest of the passengers, we tried to get the Egyptians to hang on
                    to, keep the hijackers there. They wanted no part of that. So they put the
                    hijackers on a plane to Europe, which we then intercepted and forced to land at
                    our air base in Italy, Sigonella. This annoyed the Italians that you had a plane
                    at an American air base surrounded by U.S. troops, and then you had the U.S.
                    troops surrounded by Italian troops. This led to a standoff as to what was going
                    to happen. But eventually the hijackers were turned over to the Italians, and
                    they were tried and sentenced to prison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in '88 what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Then I had to testify before Congress, in March of '86. Before that in
                    February of '86 I testified before the Congressional Commission on Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe. It is hard to imagine the difference between visas and
                    regulations nowadays concerning visas and what we had prior to 9/11. I was
                    called up to testify why the regulations concerning visas were consistent,
                    consummate with the principles of the 1975 Helsinki final act, which was a major
                    thing on negotiations with the Soviet Union on human rights. So I had to go up
                    and say that we needed to maintain the possibility of refusing visas to people
                    that we had good reason to believe were ineligible to receive the visas.</p>
                <p>I made the case that it had never been the approved policy of the United States
                    to deny visas merely because the applicant wants to say that he disapproves of
                    the U.S. or one of its policies, and that no denial is ever based on a person's
                    abstract beliefs. Then I did go on to say that under the laws, the so called
                    McCarran-Walters Act, that we will deny personal access to people who aim to
                    undermine our system through their actions or who are likely to engage in
                    proscribed intelligence activities or who raise funds or otherwise assist our
                    enemies. The commission was reasonably satisfied that our record was good on
                    that, that we didn't arbitrarily refuse visas just because somebody said they
                    disagreed with the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in '88, what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I also in March of '86 testified before the subcommittee on
                    Commerce, Transportation, and Tourism, the House Committee on Energy and
                    Commerce, and I went into the business of travel advisories. Then my time in
                    consular affairs was drawing to a close, and so I was asked if I would be
                    interested in going to Vienna as resident representative to the UN agencies in
                    Vienna, the main one being the International Atomic Energy Agency, but UNRWA,
                    the Palestine relief agency, Drug matters, status of women, and a few other UN
                    activities had been combined. The UN headquarters was in New York. The European
                    headquarters was in Geneva, but the Austrians I guess, at the initiative of Kurt
                    Waldheim, when he was minister of foreign affairs decided to attract these other
                    agencies to have their offices in Vienna. So I was asked if I would be
                    interested in that, and I said I certainly was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Vienna for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Three years, until I reached mandatory retirement at the end of '91, 65 I
                    was, and I stayed on a couple of months extra and came back in '91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well today is 27 December 2006. Mike, you were then , we
                        didn't cover Vienna did we.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, we haven't covered Vienna yet?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Vienna from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Let's see, I got there in '88, late in '88. Then I left in '91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Vienna what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: I was the resident representative to the UN agencies in Vienna. It was a
                    rather complicated situation. Vienna decided, of course you have the UN
                    headquarters in New York; you have the European headquarters in Geneva, the old
                    League of Nations complex, and the Austrians decided that they would become the
                    third UN city. They lobbied and got quite a few UN affiliated agencies to come
                    to Vienna, and they built a very nice enclave for them on the other side of the
                    Danube from the main city. The main one was the International Atomic Energy
                    Agency, IAEA, which is interesting in itself because even during the cold war
                    which is when it was established, ourselves and the Soviet Union had a very
                    strong interest in seeing that nuclear non proliferation did not take place.
                    There was UNRWA, the UN Relief and works agency for Palestinian refugees. There
                    was something called UNIDO, the UN Industrial Development Organization, which
                    later was phased out. It was quite a large thing when I got there. It was a
                    center for the UN agency to combat the drug trade. And then there were social
                    issues, the commission on the status of women. I think those were the main ones.
                    The main job was of course, with the IAEA. That was structured so that you have
                    a governor as the chief representative, but he is not resident there. The
                    governor is not resident. Then you have the resident representative, who is also
                    an ambassador who then attends to the ongoing business between times when the
                    main body consisting of the governors is in session. Like some other cities,
                    Paris and Brussels, we had four ambassadors resident in Vienna. There was the
                    bilateral ambassador, myself, and then the ambassador to the CSCE, conventional
                    forces, and then there was another ambassador assigned as head of delegation for
                    developing a chemical weapons treaty. All four of us were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our bilateral ambassador to the Austrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Henry Grunwald, the former editor in chief of Time Magazine was the
                    ambassador when I arrived. His term came to an end, and he was replaced by
                    Huffington, and an industrialist who was an oil tycoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An oil man from Texas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: We all did our own thing. It used to be prior to my arrival that on the
                    Fourth of July, each of the four would hold receptions for their respective
                    colleagues. Grunwald suggested that all of us come over to his residence and had
                    a five ambassador receiving line. That worked out better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First before we get into what you were doing and what the
                        issues were, I mean although you weren't bilateral, being a bilateralist at
                        this point with the Austrians. I mean you were a foreign service officer.
                        What was going on in Austria at that time, and how did we see that? Was Kurt
                        Waldheim an issue at the time or not?</hi>

                <p>NEWLIN: Waldheim was an issue at that time. I had two encounters with Waldheim.
                    Of course we have covered earlier my time when I was political counselor at the
                    mission when he was elected Secretary General. Then later when I was in the
                    bureau of consular affairs. We understood when he was elected that he was in the
                    German army and that he was on the Russian front, that he was wounded, and he
                    came back to Vienna and practiced law. The facts came out much later that while
                    he was in the army he was an intelligence officer, and he served in the Balkans.
                    So the people in the Justice Department that were in charge of finding war
                    criminals alleged that he was in a unit that was responsible for certain
                    atrocities that took place. So I was summoned over to the Justice
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when you were in consular affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: This is when I was in consular affairs. I was summoned over to the
                    Justice Department. They were all ready to go ahead on the basis of the
                    information they had collected and place Waldheim on the watch list which meant
                    he could not get a visa. Waldheim's lawyers were saying that Waldheim at least
                    ought to have a chance to defend himself and have legal representation. I
                    supported that strongly. I said, yes, you may have a very strong case, but it is
                    not American to go ahead just on this basis and not afford him a fair hearing.
                    So that process did go forward. They did find that they were going to put him on
                    this particular list. When I was in Vienna there he was President of Austria.
                    This meant that no really high level meetings could take place. For instance, no
                    Presidential visits or Vice Presidential visits. I think Grunwald had permission
                    that he could attend the President's New Years Day reception. But other than
                    that there was no formal contact with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of your sort of the political
                        situation in Austria at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Austria at the time was doing very well indeed. They had succeeded of
                    course in getting rid of the four power occupation after the war. They were
                    doing very well economically. They had a very capable prime minister, and things
                    were going excellently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for, I think it came a little later,
                        but this I want to say Halder, but I am not sure that is the right name. But
                        this right wing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh Heider.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Heider and the right wing movement within Austria.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: That was not as pronounced as it became later. But there was probably no
                    doubt that that part of Tyrol down around Innsbruck and in that area, that there
                    were plenty of Nazi sympathizers and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that didn't intrude into your work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh no, that didn't affect us at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about some of the things. What was your
                        relationship to the nuclear non proliferation organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well that was the main function of the International Atomic Energy
                    Agency. We were trying to get states, they could be members of the IAEA, but we
                    also wanted everyone to sign the non proliferation treaty whereby they would
                    declare that they would not become nuclear weapons states. The main holdouts
                    were of course, the North Koreans. I had many debates with the North Koreans who
                    kept attacking us. Then there were the Indians, the Pakistanis, South Africa,
                    Brazil, Argentina, Iraq and Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The Israelis nuclear situation was well known but it was recognized that
                    if anyone could make a case for a nuclear deterrent it was Israel. The director
                    general of the IAEA was one Hans Blix. He was in my view, a very capable person.
                    He certainly maintained his independence. He couldn't be pushed around by the
                    superpowers or anything like that. He was very good at managing the IAEA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came from where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He was a Swede. I will have more to say about him later after operation
                    Desert Storm and the role of both the IAEA and the UN special commission on Iraq
                    sanctions in New York which was headed by another Swede. The IAEA met at
                    different levels. I was the resident ambassador, next were the governors who met
                    quarterly and finally ministers annually. The governor was Dick Kennedy. I got
                    along reasonably well with him. Then there would be a big special meeting at the
                    ministerial level, and the Secretary of Energy used to come with a large
                    delegation to that. The ministerial delegations would come in, and they would
                    bring their own entourage and brief. I would have to insert myself into their
                    staff meetings so that I could tell them about what the local political
                    situation was in the body to which they were coming. I got along very well with
                    the Secretary of Energy.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>I might start out by saying that when I first got to Vienna, the UNVIE (United
                    States Mission to International Organizations in Vienna) mission was very small
                    in number. We didn't have a great huge mission. The people had to be pretty much
                    be able to deal with a variety of things. When I got there in late '88, a
                    Plenipotentiary conference on a treaty to combat drug trafficking was coming to
                    a head. It was headed up by an assistant secretary by the name of Ann Wrobleski,
                    who was a very capable negotiator. It turned out that as we got almost towards
                    the end, she was about to have a baby, so she had to go back to Washington. I
                    was named alternate head of the delegation, so I was the one that did the final
                    negotiations for this particular treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The issues mainly were with the Colombians and the Andean countries who
                    were willing to sign I guess reluctantly that they would combat or try to
                    prevent drug smuggling and drug trafficking and also try to do something about
                    drugs within their, so this was an issue that was hanging up. My main
                    contribution was that the Mexicans wanted to put in some language which would
                    weaken certain parts of the treaty, and for some reason the Canadian delegate, I
                    think, wanted to make a name for himself, and broker a compromise. I found out
                    that he was going around saying that the Americans really are not terribly
                    opposed to this. It will be all right. They might make some noises, but the
                    Americans will go along with this. So I had to finally say in one of the plenary
                    sessions concerning this particular issue, the United States is strongly
                    opposed. That cause him to privately explode and say well big brother is
                    throwing his weight around. I had to do that because he was misrepresenting what
                    our position was. So shortly after I got there, the treaty was agreed. Attorney
                    General, General Thornburg came out and signed it. So that was really the thing
                    that I was concentrating on when I first got there. Then we set up a UN body,
                    the Center for Drug Trafficking in the UN, and that became another UN body that
                    was permanent there. So I had to learn quickly the ins and outs of the drug
                    trade business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Mexican stand? Why were they trying to weaken
                        this? Do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I don't know whether it was out of solidarity with the Colombians and the
                    Bolivians or not. But they did, I forget the exact language that was going to
                    weaken certain parts of the treaty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel that the Canadian representative was
                        off on his or her own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I had the feeling that he probably was.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: could you sort of do a little go back to Washington and
                        say, “Why don't you go talk to Ottawa?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think this all came to a head so quickly there wasn't time for that. I
                    did let Washington know what I was going to do, and Washington said, “All right,
                    go ahead.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then on the nuclear non proliferation, I would think,
                        I mean the North Koreans were almost beyond the pale at that point or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well they were pretty obnoxious. They had signed, I believe they had
                    signed the non proliferation treaty, but they hadn't done all of the other
                    things under the NPT to implement the thing. So I had to natter the Russians and
                    the Chinese and also Hans Blix to get them on board and to get them to really
                    make sure that what they had signed up to do, that they were in the process of
                    doing. I remember one session where the North Korean representative gave a long
                    vitriolic speech about the United States and how it was gravely endangering
                    North Korea. So finally I said, “I want to assure the representatives of North
                    Korea that as long as they live up to the international obligations they have
                    undertaken under the UN Charter and the other international agreements that they
                    have signed, that they are in no danger whatsoever from the United States.” They
                    continued to be a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about I mean just from slight personal experience, but
                        dealing with the Pakistanis and Indians Of course for both of those a major
                        nuclear development was a major thing. Now as we speak today both sides have
                        got nuclear capable missiles. They could be very difficult in the
                        negotiations. How did you find them at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Both of their representatives were very capable diplomats and personal
                    relations were very good. We knew what their position was. Blix had a dinner, a
                    private dinner at his residence one evening, and he had the Pakistanis and the
                    Indians. I was there; the British were there. I think the French, and I believe
                    the Germans as well. It was a rather small group. The idea was that the people
                    that had signed the NPT were encouraging them to do so. It was all very
                    friendly, and nobody raised their voices. Both the Indians and the Pakistanis
                    had a rationale as to why this was not in their interests. This was something
                    that the Western powers had cooked up and that they were not going to go
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was in it, let's say you are India or Pakistan
                        and you say I am not going to sign the treaty. What difference would it
                        make? Could they just sort of do their own thing or were there penalties for
                        not signing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: There were penalties in that they were not eligible for peaceful nuclear
                    assistance. The whole deal, and the rationale for the IAEA and non proliferation
                    treaty regime was that we understand your desire to have nuclear power and the
                    benefits of nuclear power. You can have that for peaceful purposes as long as
                    you sign the NPT. If you sign the NPT you have to submit to inspection, your
                    reactors and your research facilities and other things where there is
                    substantial nuclear material must be accounted for and must be periodically
                    verified by the IAEA. So they did forego that. Then so far as I know, I don't
                    think anyone cheated on them by giving them things. Eventually it turned out
                    they were able on their own. Their scientists were just as capable as other
                    scientists in developing their nuclear weapons. The basic weapons technology was
                    well known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Libya part of the problem at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Libya. I don't think they were then. The activities of the rogue
                    Pakistani proliferation didn't come out until much later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Iran too was not a major factor then. Interestingly enough South Africa
                    was. The South Africans, at a high level came to town, I think the prime
                    minister himself, came to Vienna and met secretly our mission with Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, and they wanted to know that if they were to sign the NPT and agree
                    to dismantle anything to do with a weaponization program, how long a period
                    would elapse. They wanted to pin that down. It was a very fascinating thing. So
                    Kennedy and the other U.S. experts were able to answer their questions, and they
                    went back to South Africa. Then eventually they did announce that they were
                    getting out of the Nuclear business. And also the Brazilians and the
                    Argentineans did the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something that is sort of forgotten today, but Brazil and
                        Argentina somehow got into this to put it in diplomatic terms, almost a
                        pissing contest over developing nuclear weapons. We were thinking Oh my God.
                        Because they didn't particularly have any complaints...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Issues, there were no burning issues at all. Then Qadhafi of course
                    secretly had his thing out in the desert. We didn't know about it at the time. I
                    was amazed years after I left Algeria, that Algeria too had worked on a nuclear
                    weapons plant. They decided to give that up too, because they had no use to
                    waste money on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's come to Israel. I mean this. Here is this
                        thing were we often use the double standard. The Israelis as of today, I
                        don't think they have admitted they have got nuclear weapons, but everybody
                        knows they have a substantial program. How did we deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oddly enough people just figured well the situation that the Israelis
                    have, if anybody could justify nuclear weapons on the basis of survival, it
                    would be them. Of course we knew from intelligence sources and everything at
                    Dimona where they had their reactors and everything that they were developing
                    nuclear weapons. Something we made a decision not to make an issue over. Others
                    didn't either. Even the Arabs, it never really became a big issue in the IAEA.
                    Sadat had started normalizing relations with Israel and the Saudis had so much
                    oil they did not need nuclear reactors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well moving from the nuclear side, what was happening at
                        UNRWA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Before we go to UNRWA, I will
                    mention that Kennedy had permission to negotiate agreements with countries that
                    had signed the NPT for additional bilateral assistance for peaceful purposes. So
                    I found out that he was going to go off to Moscow to talk to the Russians. I
                    said, “Well may I join you?” and he said, “Yes.” That was a very interesting
                    thing. The Russians rolled out the red carpet for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the Soviets at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, the Soviet Union at the time. They rolled out the red carpet for
                    him. Then he followed up on that. There were agreements signed with the Czechs
                    and I believe the Hungarians as well. This was a side thing that was going on.
                    The main thing of course was after Desert Storm when Saddam was defeated, and
                    then the UN sanctions operations got going in New York. There was difficulty
                    between the two heads of these agencies, the IAEA in Vienna headed by Blix,
                    UNSCOM in New York headed by Ekeus, both were Swedish diplomats. Ekeus took the
                    position that he reported only to the Security Council. He didn't report to the
                    Secretary General of the UN. He said that he was really to be in charge of all
                    of the destruction of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Well that didn't sit
                    well with Blix and the IAEA. He said, “We are the ones that have the nuclear
                    expertise, and so we are the ones to do that.” So there was quite a bit of
                    dispute between the two. I tried as best I could to make peace between them. It
                    finally wound up by having joint groups go out. Bob Gallucci who later became
                    assistant secretary in PM went out with David Kay, who at that time was working
                    for Blix in the IAEA. So we had a joint group going out there. The UNSCOM and
                    IAEA blew up and destroyed all of the nuclear facilities that Saddam had
                    secretly built for the weapons program. We also, this was later on when I was in
                    UNSCOM in New York, we destroyed masses of chemical weapons, mustard gas and
                    Sarin, a nerve gas, as well as anything else that we could find. It wasn't until
                    later, remember the time two sons in law of Saddam defected and went to Jordan.
                    They told us about some of the chemical and biological program. The Anthrax
                    thing that we hadn't found before. This was something that went on.</p>
                <p>UNRRA was set up shortly after the creation of Israel when large numbers of
                    Palestinians were uprooted from their ancestral homes in Palestine and decided
                    to flee from what was under Israeli control. So large refugee camps were located
                    in the west bank and Gaza, and then also in Jordan and Lebanon. The UN and other
                    powers said, “Well the United States by its recognition of Israel and so forth
                    helped create this problem, so therefore the United States will have to pay for
                    it.” So we did get some other countries to pay as well, but it was largely a
                    U.S. thing. So that meant that a U.S. person headed it. I think it was Eagleton,
                    Bill Eagleton, who was the head of it while I was there. He was a very
                    distinguished foreign service officer, an Arabist. It just sort of ran itself at
                    that time, the Intifada had not started in Gaza. It was mainly just making sure
                    that the refugee camps and the refugee program was properly carried out. This
                    was the United Nations Relief and Reconstruction Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was started right after WWII, because I remember we
                        used to deal with it when I was in Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike, what effect did the breakup essentially of the huge
                        Soviet bloc in December of '89, and all that happened on you. How did that,
                        in the first place it was sort of a rolling thing, and then the Soviet Union
                        disintegrated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It was absolutely fascinating. I am glad you asked about that because my
                    wife of course, was born in Prague. After the communist coup in 1948 she escaped
                    to West Germany. Having been a refugee from communism she was fascinated. In
                    Vienna we had a ringside seat to everything that was going on across the borders
                    in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. I remember on one of my early trips to Moscow was
                    then I was in consular affairs in the late '80s. I was asked to go there to make
                    a presentation on foreign travel regulations. I was part of a larger delegation
                    that was going to talk about a whole range of security issues. We had a meeting
                    at the embassy before our meetings with the Soviets. So they went down the list
                    of things. The embassy deputy chief of mission said, “Oh yeah there won't be any
                    problem to that. The Russians will agree to that. Oh yeah they will make some
                    noises but they will agree to it.” So I couldn't believe my ears. At the end of
                    this I said, “Well now this is extraordinary. I have been told that the Russians
                    are extremely difficult negotiators to deal with, but that finally when you get
                    the agreement, that they do carry it out.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are really talking about the Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The Soviets. This is Gorbachev. We are talking about Gorbachev. “They
                    have come to the conclusion that society is sick and that it has to be radically
                    reformed. You will find them agreeable.” That was the beginning of for me the
                    insight that things were indeed changing. What was your question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just thinking being there in Vienna, I mean in the
                        first place I think the real opening was when the Hungarians basically
                        opened up their borders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: You are so right. That was the beginning of the opening of the
                    floodgates. It was known then that, or believed, that Gorbachev and his group
                    were telling the satellite countries that you are on your own. You better look
                    to your own perestroika and glasnost. The East Germans could go to Hungary
                    without any problem in the Soviet era. So hundreds and thousands of them went to
                    Hungary with the idea then that some how they would get to Austria. This put the
                    Austrians in a very difficult situation indeed. The Hungarians were unprepared
                    to take care of all of these people. Finally the Austrians agreed that they
                    could cross the Danube and come in. They did, they flooded in, and eventually
                    the West Germany government accepted them.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Something similar happened in Prague before the velvet revolution. East Germany
                    could also freely go to communist Czechoslovakia. Once there, they headed for
                    the West German embassy and climbed over the wall. So they camped out. There
                    were hundreds and hundreds of them in the garden there. Finally the West Germans
                    said that they would take them. They sent trains, and then they got out. But
                    this was a fascinating thing to see all of these refugees. They abandoned their
                    Trabant cars in the streets of Prague. But towards the end, just before the
                    velvet revolution was happening in Prague, my wife and I would go over to
                    Bratislava which was the capital of Slovakia. We even surreptitiously
                    participated in some demonstrations, anti Soviet demonstrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you jangling keys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. Milena would say, “Get your keys out.” I would get the keys out. So
                    that was absolutely fascinating, to be there to see this happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the organizations, I would have imagined the whole UN
                        apparatus in Vienna was almost transfixed by this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: All of us were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of you were international observers, but all of a
                        sudden you were in the middle of a peaceful revolution but a real
                        revolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right. It was the collapse of the Soviet empire. The evolution of
                    course started out years before in Poland, and the Hungarians in 1956. The
                    Hungarians had revolted and the Soviets invaded. Then the Poles were the leaders
                    for awhile. Then finally the East Germans, but this influx of all of these
                    people then finally led to the collapse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the organizations you were working with?
                        They all had East German components, Czech components? You know in other
                        words, their representatives must have been sort of bewildered. Who am I
                        reporting to? How am I going to keep my job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Exactly. I am sure that was a major thing with the Russians. They didn't
                    know whether they were going to be thrown out, cashiered. The wife of the
                    Russian ambassador while all of this was going on, particularly the things in
                    Moscow, the Russian ambassador's wife told my wife, “Well I wondered whether I
                    would be coming to you and asking for asylum.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well did that affect the workings of the various
                        organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No. The people there, the Russian Ambassador, Roland Timerbaev was a very
                    capable ambassador. He wasn't Russian at all. He was a Bashir. But he was a well
                    known ambassador. They went along and worked with us, and we got things
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never quite understood your job there. You are the
                        ambassador to the UN organizations. You have these organizations all of whom
                        have I suppose essentially for the Americans somebody like Richard Kennedy,
                        who was sort of the head of those delegations. How did you relate to these
                        organizations. I mean were you an administrative head or more than
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well now, because we had ongoing things in all of these bodies. The IAEA
                    we had meetings , well practically every day dealing with budgetary things and
                    other things dealing with non proliferation. Then there was this other
                    organization I mentioned called UNIDO. That was supposed to promote industrial
                    development in underdeveloped countries. Where they got their money was some
                    large agency would decide that something ought to be built in some undeveloped
                    country. Then they would subcontract this to UNIDO, and UNIDO would collect
                    money from the sponsoring organizations. Eventually people decided that wasn't a
                    very practical way to do things and so they would make other arrangements. So
                    UNIDO was phased out. I might say something on the Commission on the Status of
                    Women, and the U.S. delegate there was one Maureen Reagan. She was something
                    else. So I had to meet Maureen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was at that point former President Reagan's
                        daughter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right. So she used her clout. There came up an issue in the
                    document that they were drafting that should be a statute or treaty on the
                    status of women. The Canadian representative was being unhelpful to Maureen. So
                    Maureen gets on the phone and calls up the minister in Ottawa that dealt with
                    this and said, “Look, this person is being unhelpful to me. This won't do.” The
                    minister said, “Yes, Maureen, that's right, No, you are right.” So the next
                    morning they are going into the meeting; Maureen ran into the Canadian
                    representative. The Canadian representative said, “We have to talk.” Maureen
                    said, “We don't have to talk. I am telling you what your instructions are.” So
                    that was Maureen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I got along with her all right. She was really something else. But I
                    fortunately got along with Maureen.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was she coming from? I mean you know, on the
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well she was very interested in doing something to improve the status of
                    women. She was living in the White House with the Reagans. So she could see the
                    President any time she wanted to, and people knew that. She had an interest in
                    women's things. Substantively she probably was entirely right on this as far as
                    I could tell. I gather she could be difficult to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then let's see. Did the problem of contraception,
                        birth control come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That, fortunately, did not boil up in our deliberations. After the drug
                    treaty was signed we had to set up in Vienna the UN Commission on Drug
                    Trafficking. Since the Italians had been very helpful in the negotiations an
                    Italian was the head of that. So we worked very closely with them. I accompanied
                    him on his first visit to Washington. We called on the attorney general who had
                    signed the treaty. We got that up and running.</p>
                <p>To answer your question. I was the US representative to all of the UN agencies in
                    Vienna including the IAEA. As mentioned, it met at three different levels but I
                    represented the United States at all but a small number of meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then did you find you were there between, you came in
                        under the Reagan administration and then the Bush I administration came in.
                        How did you keep your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Good question. I of course, was fortunate in that I knew the new
                    president personally. But I got there just before the election. So when the
                    election was over, there is a time honored rule that when you have ambassadorial
                    or other appointment where you have to be confirmed by the senate, that you
                    submit a letter of resignation. So all of us of course, were wondering what was
                    going to happen. We got a telegram then from the State Department saying the
                    President has decided that all career ambassadors will stay at their posts for
                    their normal tour of duty. Since I had just arrived, that was very good news. It
                    was not too long into the new administration, my secretary burst in and said,
                    “The President on the line.” I said, “Oh, that is nice.” I picked up the phone.
                    “Mike, I would like you to go as my ambassador to Luxembourg.” I said, “Well Mr.
                    President that is very nice. Let me think that over. I have just arrived in this
                    new job, and we have got this big problem setting up the new anti-drug
                    commission. May I think it over. I will go and talk it over with Milena.” He
                    said, “Yes, you do that Mike.” Then I sent him a back channel, Ambassadors can
                    send a back channel messages directly to him. I said I was honored but I thought
                    I could be more useful in Vienna. He came back and said, “I understand your
                    position, and I agree with it, and I am very proud to have you as my friend.”
                    There is a delicate thing telling the president that you didn't want to accept
                    an ambassadorial appointment. But I had no interest in, with all that was going
                    on in Vienna.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had real issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The really bug issues. The collapse of the Soviet empire and Desert
                    Storm, were yet to come. We had four resident ambassadors in Vienna. Steve
                    Ledogar was negotiating a chemicals weapons treaty. He came to me and said,
                    “Mike, did you see that telegram from the Department saying we have got to
                    submit a letter of resignation?” I said, “Yes, that is standard. We all have to
                    do that. You can put in the letter anything you want to, but it also must have
                    Mr. President, I submit my resignation at a date to be decided at your
                    convenience.” I said, “But you can fill the letter with all that you are doing
                    and all that you hope to do, but you must have that in there.” So he did that.
                    He was at a dinner that evening with his Russian counterpart who was a rather
                    dour man, didn't have very much small talk. He said, “Well I resigned today.”
                    The Russian replied, “You did? Why did you do that.” He then explained what the
                    custom was. The Russian said, “That is a very strange system.” Ledogar said,
                    “Well it beats a knock on the door at 2:00 A.M. The Russian laughed.</p>
                <p>Then while I was there, Jim Woolsey who later went on to be head of CIA was head
                    of the CSCE. We were in the same building. Negotiations on the status of
                    conventional weapons in Europe had dragged on for years with the Russians on
                    reducing non nuclear armaments. Finally under Gorbachev and Shevardnadze
                    agreement had been reached. We had a high level Congressional delegation coming
                    to be briefed just before the signing, to take place in Paris. I was invited to
                    come down and sit in in case anything would come up on the nuclear side. Woolsey
                    had a large staff with admirals and generals and all sorts of experts. They got
                    up and said, “Now this is an historic thing. It is not going to be a 50-50
                    thing. It is going to be asymmetric, because the Russians are of course, very
                    close to Western Europe, they will have to reduce larger amounts and of course
                    redeploy their weapons.” They gave the figures which made it sound like it was
                    an extraordinary deal for NATO. he junior representative from the Congressional
                    delegation from Georgia, Newt Gingrich, said, “Do you believe the Russians are
                    really going to do that?” Woolsey said what I remarked earlier. “They are
                    difficult to negotiate with, but once they agree, they do carry it out.”
                    Gingrich shook his head and said, “Well all I have got to say is if I was a
                    Russian, I wouldn't sign that.” So they did go off to Paris, sign the thing, and
                    then right away word came from Moscow that Woolsey had better get himself to
                    Moscow because the Russians couldn't carry out all the provisions. So Woolsey
                    had to go there. In the negotiations with the Russian generals kept explaining,
                    “Look we cannot. It is just impossible to do all of this within this time
                    frame.” Woolsey said, “This treaty will be changed over my dead body.” The
                    Russian had never heard that expression before and he said, “What is he talking
                    about, his dead body?” Then the Russian said, “Da, Da, it will be over your dead
                    body.” The Russian deployments were worked out and Woolsey survived and went on
                    to head the CIA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me though, let's talk about you were there when
                        Saddam Hussein and Iraq invaded Kuwait. How did that affect what you all
                        were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Right. It affected the UN greatly. The basic Security Council resolution
                    authorizing the use of force was to oust Saddam from Kuwait. It did not envisage
                    the invasion of Iraq or the ouster of Saddam. As part of the cease fire, Iraq
                    agreed the UN would find and destroy all weapons of mass destruction. A special
                    UN commission on Iraq sanctions, UNSCOM, was set up and was to report to the
                    security council rather than to Boutros Gali, the secretary general. Though not
                    spelled out, it was generally understood the IAEA would play a role since it had
                    inspected the Iraqi nuclear reactor under the NPT. UNSCOM was headed by Rolf
                    Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat. The IAEA was headed by Hans Blix, another Swede. The
                    question between these two Swedish diplomats, both of whom had sizable egos,
                    what was the pecking order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was between New York and Vienna.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Blix in Vienna and Ekeus in New York. I got drawn into this. I tried to
                    say well we can work this out, have joint teams. The nuclear experts from here
                    can go, and then Ekeus had recruited some nuclear experts of his own as well. I
                    said, “This has to be a joint operation and we have to work together.” That is
                    the way it did in fact work. But then to our great surprise the Iraqis, once
                    this system got started, admitted that they had secretly produced some plutonium
                    from their reactor. So that was a tip off that they did have nuclear weapons
                    ambition. They admitted that to the IAEA. I reported that immediately. Then
                    later on Gallucci, from UNSCOM, and Kay, from the IAEA, inspected a building
                    that they went to in Baghdad on short notice, kicked the door down and went in.
                    They found documents in there that indicated there was a program for nuclear
                    weapons. Gallucci and Kay were out at what was supposed to be a place where
                    tanks and other conventional things were. It was all behind a high fence. They
                    were denied entrance although they were supposed to under the terms of the
                    agreement to have the right to go anywhere they wanted to go. So they climbed up
                    on a high structure and looked in. They could see that the Iraqis were
                    feverishly loading something on trucks, large pieces of things on trucks. They
                    started out the gate with them. The UN people followed them until the Iraqis
                    fired over their heads and made them stop. It turned out these were great huge
                    magnets called calutrons which we had used to develop our first weapon. So that
                    was something. We then found out later that they had a pilot centrifuge as well
                    which was much more efficient. Outside Baghdad was a large new facility where
                    the research was going on and also where I think the centrifuge project was
                    going. Blix said, “Well we don't have to destroy everything, we can just clean
                    it out.” The Iraqis said they wanted to turn the building into a school and a
                    library. I took the position that the whole thing had to be destroyed, so they
                    did blow it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get along with Blix?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: I got along with Blix all right. One thing, I had to do was I had to try
                    to get as many capable Americans on his staff whenever a vacancy would come up.
                    Sometimes I succeeded and sometimes I didn't. He wasn't going to be pushed
                    around. But I thought he was a very capable person. I think he was very badly
                    used by the administration later on in the run up to the Iraq invasion. The UN
                    brought him out of retirement and put him in charge of a beefed up inspection
                    operation. Of course they couldn't find any weapons of mass destruction because
                    Saddam had secretly destroyed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well is there anything else we should cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I think we have covered all the main things during my career as a Foreign
                    Service officer. I reached the age of 65 in May of '91, so I had to formally
                    retire from the foreign service at that time, but I could stay in Vienna until
                    September until my tour was up. I left then in September of '91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after retirement just briefly what have you been up
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I would like if I could crave your indulgence, I would like to
                    explain what I did afterwards because that was for me perhaps the most important
                    part of my career with the State Department. I was rehired as a rehired
                    annuitant. I came back to the Department and I worked in the bureau of political
                    military affairs. I got involved in the Nunn Lugar program to control nuclear
                    material in the former states of the Soviet Union that ha nuclear weapons and
                    facilities o their territories. There is a considerable tale to that. I also
                    wound up in New York as Ekeus' deputy, my Swedish friend. I had so much trouble
                    with, little did I know that one day I would be his deputy in New York. Then I
                    also became an acting deputy assistant secretary of state in PM dealing with
                    arms sales, so I had a whole new career after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the UN. How did you find Ekeus and what
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I found Ekeus to be very competent and skilled. He was marvelous in
                    his ability to be autonomous in this major UN undertaking. Secretary General
                    Boutros Ghali thought that Ekeus ought to report to him. Ekeus said no, I report
                    to the Security Council that appointed me. Since the presidency of the security
                    council rotated monthly, he had no permanent superior. So we had Russians on our
                    staff. We had various nationalities. This is where my experience in Vienna with
                    the IAEA came in handy because I knew the whole cast of characters. I knew David
                    Kay and the others and their specialties. So one of my contributions was to get
                    the U.S. to release imagery from our satellites so that Russian experts from
                    Moscow could show us where they modified the scuds so they could reach all the
                    way to Tel Aviv. Where those factories were. At first Washington said, no,
                    Russians were not allowed to see such detailed satellite images. Finally we
                    broke through that barrier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So most of your work with Ekeus was essentially dealing
                        with disarmament of Iraq.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right. That was our mission. And as I say we had a huge program
                    going to destroy the munitions with mustard gas and nerve gas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That had to be a very tricky thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: A tricky thing. You had to have experts that knew what they were doing on
                    that. We were destroying our own excess chemical weapons out on Johnston Island.
                    That was a big deal. You had to transport it and the environmentalists were up
                    in arms. But we would get all of this and were going along lickety-split in
                    Iraq. And as I say we found out about all of their nuclear things. When Ekeus
                    was on leave in Sweden I was in charge of the whole operation in New York,
                    including scheduling the inspections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being part of an arm of the UN in New
                        York bureaucratically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Under Ekeus it was wonderful. Because we had our own administrative set
                    up we didn't have to really get involved with the UN any more than going to work
                    in the UN Building, and reporting periodically to the security council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then what were you doing in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Before I left Vienna I sent a back channel letter to President Bush, the
                    current President Bush's father. I described what I had done there, and then I
                    said I would be very interested if it would be possible to be of assistance
                    anywhere in your administration that you think I could be useful. So I got a
                    very nice letter back from him that said, “Mike, I have taken note of your
                    interest and I have let the appropriate people here know.” That was all he said.
                    So I came back as part of the retirement seminar, which is a wonderful thing the
                    Department does. I am sure you went through it too. I got back here, and we were
                    all waiting in the Acheson Auditorium. Larry Williamson was in personnel at that
                    time. When he saw me and he said, “Mike we have to talk.” I said, “Oh, yeah,
                    good.” He said that when Director General Perkins and Ron Spiers, undersecretary
                    for administration, went over to the White House to consult with President Bush
                    on the new ambassadorial appointments that would be the career people. Larry
                    said President Bush said, “I don't see Mike Newlin on the list.” Perkins and
                    Spiers reportedly said, “Oh, we will take care of Mike.” That led to a contract
                    as a rehired annuitant. They didn't know what to do with me so they assigned me
                    to the undersecretary's office of security and military affairs. On reporting, I
                    was asked to head the interagency group on supercomputers. Joe Presel, who used
                    to work for me in IO, was leaving this position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have started an interview with Joe. I haven't finished
                        the damn thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He is delightful. Isn't he a delightful person. I said, “Joe, I don't
                    know anything about super computers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the Quay computers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Cray. They do 150 million operations a minute. Can you imagine such a
                    thing? The Japanese had independently developed their own super computers. So we
                    had a bilateral regime with the Japanese that we would agree on who would get
                    super computers. It had to be a reliable company that wouldn't try to find out
                    what the workings of the super computer were, and would not apply them to
                    military use. So Joe turned this operation over to me. The first thing I did, I
                    went down to Cray's office to get a briefing. They told me about the
                    capabilities of all of this. So during my tenure there, the Indians said they
                    wanted to buy a super computer for weather forecasting. They are very useful for
                    weather forecasting among other things. So Cray was all for this. Cray said, “We
                    can work this thing out so that it can have a line from the computer in India to
                    our headquarters. It will tell us if anybody tries to tamper with the computer
                    for non approved activities.” But my own feelings and the feelings of my inter
                    departmental group were that we weren't about to trust the Indians on this with
                    good reason. It turned out the Indians, just as we developed our own nuclear
                    weapons without a super computer, could do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>After a while, it was decided I should go to political military affairs, PM.
                    Richard Clarke was the assistant secretary. He later became the counterterrorism
                    chief in the White House and was the person who said on 9/11, “This is al
                    Qaeda.” Later in Congressional testimony h apologized to 9/11 members for the
                    failure to foresee and forestall the attack. He asked me what I would like to
                    do. I said, “Well, since I have a background in UN affairs, if Bob Gallucci, who
                    was Ekeus' deputy in New York, leaves for any reason, I would be interested in
                    going up there. Otherwise, anything to do with helping the former Soviet Union
                    and the newly independent nuclear states in the non proliferation business, I
                    would be very interested in doing that.” So sitting in my office one day I was
                    told Clarke would like to see you. I went up. He said, “Gallucci tells me that
                    he has either got to come back to Washington or get a divorce. Mike would you go
                    up and replace him?” I said, “Well I will go up temporarily until you can find a
                    permanent replacement there.” So I went up and I was there for about nine
                    months. That began my relationship with UNSCOM. I guess if it is all right with
                    you I would like to stop there because this is a convenient place. Then I can
                    talk the next time about all that I did to negotiate export control regimes in
                    Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we will do that. Today is 10 January 2007.
                        Mike, put me back in the picture now. We are talking about you are going up
                        to the UN. When did you go up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I went up to the UN in I think it was February of '92. I had, I think I
                    had mentioned to you earlier when I first came back as a rehired annuitant, they
                    asked me what I wanted to do when I was assigned to PM. I said, Well, with my UN
                    background, if Gallucci ever wants to come back to Washington I would be
                    interested in doing something like that. Since I had been of course ambassador
                    to the IAEA, and I had a background in nuclear matters. Or, I said, “I would be
                    interested in doing anything that would deal with the problems that we have in
                    the nuclear sector with the former Soviet Union.” Dick Clarke said, “Gallucci
                    has got to come back here, so would you go up?” I was delighted to say yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was the situation, to put us back in the
                        picture, what was the situation vis a vis at this point it was now the
                        former Soviet Union but it had just happened or had it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, it had just happened, the dissolution. That had quite a lot to do
                    with export controls in that whole area.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The establishment of effective export control systems. But that was
                    something that I really got into deeply after the UN time that I was up
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: The UN where I was there for about nine months. UNSCOM is the
                    abbreviation for the UN Special Commission on Iraq sanctions. After Desert Storm
                    and the various things that were imposed by the Security Council on Iraq, was a
                    system of UN inspections to root out the weapons of mass destruction and destroy
                    those that were found. The UN special commission was established as a sub body
                    under the Security Council It was headed by a Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekeus, who
                    was a very competent diplomat. Bob Gallucci had been his deputy. I became the
                    deputy executive chairman under Ekeus with the rank of assistance secretary
                    general. And the senior U.S. person in UNSCOM. Our job was to cover all of the
                    weapons of mass destruction that had been accumulated over the years by Saddam.
                    The particular focus of course, was on the nuclear side. At that time we had
                    discovered and were destroying vast quantities of nerve gas, serum, and mustard
                    gas in addition to going after the nuclear materials. The Iraqis were charged
                    under the instructions from the UN to come clean and report everything that they
                    had done in the nuclear field. This, they dragged their feet on and said that
                    all that they had was a nuclear reactor which they claimed was for generation of
                    power which had been bombed by the Israelis earlier. It was a French reactor.
                    Even though that had damaged the reactor, the highly enriched fuel was still
                    there. So the first order of business was to get that particular fuel and get
                    that turned over to the IAEA. Then to get the fuel rods out of the reactor and
                    send those off to Russia. Then we began trying to find out just what they had
                    been up to. It turned out that not only were they planning to use calutrons,
                    which were great big magnets which we had used as one of the things to produce
                    our first nuclear weapon, but they also had a program that was fairly far
                    advanced, with centrifuges made of maraging steel. Also they had gone into
                    producing a form of lithium which you need to trigger a nuclear device. All of
                    this had been discovered by previous inspections led by Gallucci from New York
                    and also the famous David Kay from the IAEA in Vienna. The inspections were
                    supposed to be a joint operation between UNSCOM in New York and IAEA in
                    Vienna.</p>
                <p>My experience in the time that I was there was that our intelligence on Iraq was
                    just terrible. Remember we had no real penetration through all of the
                    intelligence agencies that we had, really what they had or what they were up to
                    in this area. One example was, and of course you had CIA, DIA, NSA and who knows
                    what else, having all of the analysts, and they weren't coming up with anything.
                    So we kept getting false leads. There was one large building out from Baghdad.
                    It looked like sort of a palace with two reflecting pools out in front of it. We
                    got word that this was no doubt a subterranean nuclear facility. These were
                    cooling pools from reactors and that kind of thing. So we got the people lined
                    up and the inspectors went out. It was a surprise operation.. We didn't tell the
                    Iraqi government where we were going that day. Then once we got outside of
                    Baghdad we went there. Then the big altercation arose would they be allowed in
                    eventually? We were allowed in. It was just one of the many palaces that Saddam
                    had built. It was completely empty inside. There was nothing to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>Then another one was an agent said that there was a place down near the river
                    which was producing nuclear material. So we went down there. It turned out that
                    it just wasn't true at all. On the other hand, the Russians of course, had
                    provided a lot of military equipment over the years to Iraq including scud
                    missiles. So the Russians were very helpful to us by telling us first of all how
                    many scuds they had delivered, where they were being modified by the Iraqis and
                    so forth. So that part went very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you feel that speaking of how the Russians were
                        there, was concern of leakage of expertise or information from the former
                        Soviet Union to Iraq at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I wouldn't be surprised if the Russians had not been involved in
                    some of the technical aspects of modifying the scuds beyond the range that they
                    would normally have. If you recall, during Desert Storm, Iraq launched several
                    scuds towards Israel. Of course one of them did manage to hit Tel Aviv. Several
                    of them broke up in flight. The modification was not technically very good. We
                    deployed the Patriot anti-missile system to Israel but I have the impression it
                    did not hit any Iraqi scuds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you feel that the Russians were really were not a
                        participant in nuclear development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. I am positive that the Russians did nothing to try to help them on
                    the nuclear side because the Russians and us, it goes back to the founding
                    during the cold war, of the IAEA to prevent, to promote peaceful nuclear
                    activities but to combat proliferation. I am sure the Russians were not
                    involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one place where the United States and the Soviet
                        Union were in agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Absolutely. Even during the worst days of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have got these nuclear toys but we don't want anybody
                        else to have them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That's right. Well the Russians did make a mistake I believe right after
                    communists took over in China. I think they did help the Chinese, and then of
                    course when their relations soured, that was a big mistake that they figured
                    they had made. When China then became a nuclear power, that was something that
                    they had contributed to. The Chinese would have done that anyway, but it would
                    have taken longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any concern about two rather aggressive
                        mercantile countries at that time, France and Germany, at least maybe not as
                        government policy, but firms in those countries supplying the Iraqis with
                        know how, material and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: There were occasional instances where we discovered though intelligence
                    that some German firms were violating the sanctions. We would report this to the
                    Germans and they would take appropriate actions to turn it off. We didn't make a
                    great public issue of it. Nothing appeared in the newspapers or anything like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did France play in this equation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: France was not I think a major player. France had done the initial
                    reactor, that is true. They had furnished the highly enriched uranium from their
                    own production for that. But I don't recall that they were a major problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at the time, I mean the Soviet Union had just
                        broken up, so you had its component parts particularly Kazakhstan and
                        Ukraine and Belarus. Was there concern at the UN about leakage from these
                        particular areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes. There certainly was. But that was being dealt with outside the Iraq
                    sanctions operations because as I say, the Russians were on board with the
                    sanctions and with helping us do whatever needed to be done to deal with the
                    weapons of mass destruction. We also suspected that there was a biological
                    component. We asked them about anthrax and other biological elements. They said,
                    “Oh yes we have small amounts of anthrax for veterinarian purposes.” But that is
                    all. It wasn't until two sons in law of Saddam Hussein defected, at the time
                    they defected and went with their families to Jordan. They were debriefed there.
                    They filled us in that there was quite a significant anthrax program. We were
                    able as a result of that to root that out. But Tariq Aziz was the designated
                    person by Saddam to come to New York and Brief the Security Council as to what
                    they were doing. But we had to constantly threaten them that unless they did do
                    what we wanted to do under the Security Council resolutions, we would have to
                    report their non compliance with the Security Council. They were very much
                    trying to show that they were cooperating albeit reluctantly, the idea being
                    that they wanted to get the sanctions lifted which among other things restricted
                    oil exports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the attitude particularly at the top of
                        the UN? What was the feeling from your Swedish head of your section plus
                        your own feeling and people around you about what were the Iraqis up to? Do
                        you think that they, was there even the opportunity give the state of
                        inspection and what you saw for them really to develop a nuclear
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes. They were if desert Storm had not come along, they would, it
                    would have taken awhile. Of course it is no, you can produce fissile material,
                    but then weaponization of that is another big step. They did have the calutrons
                    already in operation when Desert Storm started. They stopped that and dismantled
                    them. Gallucci and David Kay found out about those when they were moving them
                    around. Later on we found out that they had set up centrifuges, and they were
                    ready to start on the centrifuges. That is a much more efficient way to produce
                    fissile material. We had no idea that they were doing this at all, that they had
                    been able to do this. It shows you the difficulty that people have now trying to
                    deal with the Iranian program because you can hide these things relatively
                    easily. One of the main things that happened that I was involved in was once we
                    had discovered the sites where the nuclear activity was going on, they had to be
                    destroyed. The Iraqis tried to persuade the IAEA to take out and destroy the
                    nuclear part, but leave the buildings because we would like to turn those into
                    schools. So I took the position that anything that was related to the nuclear
                    program had to be completely destroyed. That is what we finally did with UNSCOM
                    and the IAEA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, I would have thought the Israelis would
                        have had quite an intelligence operation in there. Did they or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I have the impression that Israel, like everyone else, did not have a
                    significant intelligence operation in Iraq. Somehow Israel discovered Iraq
                    building an enormous cannon in a hillside in western Iraq that could reach
                    Israel. They discovered the European in charge of the project and assassinated
                    him in Belgium. The Israelis did tell us about the German firm's intention to
                    sell maraging steel for centrifuges but I suppose that came from their
                    operations in Germany, not in Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did much intelligence seem to be coming out? Did anyone
                        else have good intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, we were completely in the dark. We were doing everything that we
                    could to, then somebody said, “Well we have got to test the river. We have got
                    to test the Euphrates because maybe some nuclear traces can be found there. I
                    think we got a French group that came in with their wet suits and everything and
                    went into the river and came up with samples. Nothing ever turned up that
                    way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He was the front man. I guess he was foreign minister.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: I thought he was very slick. He tried to present a reasonable face. He
                    was very personable, and knew how to deal with westerners. “Oh we are
                    cooperating, yes we are trying. It is difficult to come up with some of these
                    facts and figures, but we are working on it. Our nuclear program was for
                    peaceful purposes only, and had nothing to do with all that.” Lies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at this point of the operation of
                        the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well, UNSCOM was a unique body with well defined objectives set up under
                    unique circumstances. I have already mentioned that Ekeus took the position that
                    he reported only to the security council, a 15 member body whose presidency
                    rotated. UNSCOM's reports were well received. It also enjoyed administrative
                    autonomy because Iraq paid for it. Prior to the invasion, Hans Blix was charged
                    with conducting a beefed up inspection operation. When he reported that he had
                    not found any nuclear weapons Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were not pleased and a
                    report was leaked that Wolfowitz had asked the CIA for a report on Blix. After
                    the invasion the Pentagon mounted a massive search which also came up empty
                    handed. Then David Kay was charged to assemble another large inspection body.
                    David reported to Congress that Iraq had no nuclear weapons. It would be
                    interesting to know how much these operations cost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well looking at this, you have been in and out of the UN
                        from time to time, could there be an effective Secretary General or was it
                        such that the organization had become dysfunctional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It is almost impossible now. When you know the early days back in the
                    60's and early 70's membership was around 60. What is it now, 180 members? I
                    remember the delegation complaining whenever the decolonization took place, and
                    it was going up to 60 members. It is going to make it difficult for us to muster
                    our majorities. There are some things that the UN can do, and there has been
                    creative. There are some things they do very well on the humanitarian side. I
                    think Kofi Anan, he has not been perfect, but Kofi Anan has helped restore in
                    certain areas what the UN can do. Unfortunately he was put in charge of the
                    bigger task than he could effectively supervise within existing resources. The
                    head of the operation under Anan was accused of gross mismanagement.</p>

                    <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were doing this, this would have been during the
                        Clinton administration just came, or it hadn't come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: It came in while I was in New York in '92. The election took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left that in what early '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, in the fall of '92, I came back to Washington. By that time there
                    had been a big change in PM. Dick Clarke had run afoul of Mr. Funk the inspector
                    General who accused Clarke of not following up on some intelligence, something
                    that the Israelis were alleged up to. I don't know why. So Dick Clarke was eased
                    out of PM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick Clarke was head of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: He was the assistant secretary of state for political military affairs.
                    He was eased out, but he wound up over in the White House as their
                    counterterrorism expert. Bob Gallucci had recently been appointed to replace
                    Clarke when the election took place. The Clinton transition team asked Gallucci
                    if he would stay on. Bob said, “Yes.” He hadn't been in the job for long, he
                    would stay on. Then later on the transition group began to make decisions to
                    which career people would leave and where the political appointees would come
                    in. They started harassing Gallucci and they said, “Where is your letter of
                    resignation?” So Gallucci called a group of us together. I said, “You should
                    tell them that the transition team earlier asked you to stay on, and you agreed.
                    That was the agreement between you and the transition.” So they finally dropped
                    that, and he did stay on then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: After Clarke wound up over at the White House, he persuaded Rand Beers to
                    join him as his deputy. Have you interviewed him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I haven't finished, but I started.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Okay, well Rand Beers was the deputy assistant secretary for export for
                    munitions licensing and policy which was the largest group in PM which issued
                    licenses for the export of military equipment. This all goes back many years
                    when Congress passed a law saying the State Department would be responsible for
                    licensing military items. Of course it all had to be coordinated with Defense
                    and with the other appropriate agencies. A big thing. So I had to quickly learn
                    all about export controls, first of all the laws and then the regulations. Then
                    I was doing that, when Bob Einhorn who was the person that Gallucci relied on
                    for anything to do with nuclear matters, Bob Einhorn came into my office one day
                    and said, “Mike, would you be willing to lead a delegation to Kazakhstan to
                    explain to them export controls?” I said, “I would be delighted to do that.” So
                    we put together a delegation under the Nunn Lugar program which was one of the
                    most far-sighted pieces of legislation that was done to deal with problems
                    resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Nunn Lugar program was to
                    secure and prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials. The heart was the
                    safe and secure dismantlement of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and
                    Belarus but export controls were also a part to short circuit the involved
                    Congressional budget procedures and in view of the urgency of the problems, the
                    Nunn Lugar legislation provided that an initial sum of $500 million would be
                    reprogrammed from the enormous Pentagon budget. Easier said than done. Belarus
                    was a special case but Ukraine and Kazakhstan had so may other problems that
                    they hesitated to address SSD. So I guess I was the first one to be asked to do
                    something under Nunn Lugar. Now this was quite apart, Stu, from everything that
                    was going on at the very highest levels including the president and secretary of
                    state to deal with what is going to happen with all of these nuclear weapons and
                    nuclear facilities in the newly independent states. That was all being dealt
                    with separately. Things like export controls, and then later on safe and secure
                    dismantlement of nuclear warheads and nuclear materials. That was all under the
                    Nunn Lugar program. So I put together my team. It had people from DOD, customs,
                    energy, CIA. So we were all ready to go. We sent a telegram to Almaty which was
                    the capital then. The person that was responsible in PM for getting the Nunn
                    Lugar funding called up defense and defense said, “Oh, we are still working on
                    this reprogramming thing. There is no money available now, and we don't know
                    where it is coming from.” Imagine the bureaucratic scrounging. Nobody wanting
                    their money reprogrammed. Dan Poneman was on the NSC staff. He followed the PM
                    operations. He was having a meeting to discuss a variety things. The assistant
                    secretary of defense for international affairs, I think it was Ashton Carter.
                    Have you ever heard of Ash Carter? No, I think. He was from the Kennedy school
                    at Harvard. So I went over to the old executive office building and sat in on
                    this meeting. When Ash Carter got up to go back to the Pentagon, I got up and
                    went out and I said, “Look, we have got a real problem here. We are supposed to
                    carry this thing forward and Kazakhstan is willing. We can't get any money from
                    you.” He said, “I will take care of it.” And he did. So off we went.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>It was a very interesting experience. Here the Soviet Union dissolved. The people
                    in charge were the people; many of them had been running things under Moscow
                    including the president. Here the United States comes in and wants to talk to
                    them about creating export controls. Of course that raised suspicions. Why are
                    the Americans doing this? What is in it for them? What is in it for us and so
                    forth and so on. But they did produce a Kazakh delegation with all the
                    appropriate people.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>They had just created their own atomic energy agency with their own Kazakh
                    personnel. Of course there were vast quantities of nuclear material.
                    Ust-Kamenogorsk was the largest factory in the world that produced nuclear
                    materials for reactors. So we explained to them our own system and the fact that
                    they needed to move quickly to set up their own export controls. Our system
                    while it is very effective, it is very cumbersome because of the accumulated
                    regulations that we have. I stressed to them that they should set up something
                    that met their requirements and not necessarily try to duplicate what we were
                    doing. They were very receptive. They had their own fledgling experts there. We
                    spent several days in sessions. Airplane connections in those days were not very
                    frequent, so we wound up at the end with a couple of free days. Somebody said we
                    ought to do a field trip. I said, “Sure, where do you think we ought to go?”
                    “Well let's go to Baikonur, their Kennedy Space Center, or we can ask to go to
                    the Chinese border and see what the export controls are on the Chinese border,
                    or we can ask to go to their nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk.” I laughed. “Do
                    you think they will let us go to Semipalatinsk?” So they said, “Well let's ask.”
                    The answer came back, “Well no, we are working at Baikonur.” They first said yes
                    to the Chinese border, and then they said no, there was a transportation
                    problem. They finally said toward the end of our stay, “You can go to
                    Semipalatinsk.” There was a catch though. There were no air connections with the
                    old Aeroflot that would get us to Semipalatinsk and back to Almaty in time for
                    us to get one of the flights back to Frankfurt. My colleagues said, “Let's ask
                    the Department if we can charter a military plane from the Kazakhs to go there.”
                    I laughed and said, “That will take weeks to decide.” They said, “Well we can
                    ask can't we?” “Yeah, go ahead and send them a telegram.” Next morning the
                    answer came back, “Go to the embassy, get $1500. Charter plane and take your
                    delegation to Semipalatinsk.” Off we went. We flew in a modified military plane
                    called a Yak. The Kazakhs met us at the airport and we bussed out to the test
                    site. Drove up to their building and here were the Russian generals with their
                    pie plate hats. “We welcome you to Semipalatinsk on behalf of the President of
                    Kazakhstan.” And they were very nice. We drove around through what had been
                    their open air nuclear test area. Our representative from energy was a lady. She
                    said, “This is all a charade. These cows and sheep that are out here eating all
                    this green grass. It is all radioactive. You would never drink any milk or eat
                    any of this flesh.” So we then stopped by a door. We all got out and went in ,
                    put on the white smocks. They gave us a dosimeter to measure radioactivity. We
                    went down a corridor looking up at a huge reactor, brand new reactor. One member
                    of our delegation was from the Sandia nuclear laboratory. He had nothing to say
                    during the entire time we had been there. Then he started asking questions.
                    “What is the reactor fueled with?” “Well highly enriched uranium. Weapons grade
                    uranium.” “How much? When was it put in? What is the reactor used for?” “The
                    Reactor is used for research.” So we had a very successful meeting there. We
                    went back and had a nice luncheon. As we were getting ready to leave to be
                    bussed back into town, the Kazakhs came up to us and said, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    would you by any chance have space on your plane for some of our delegation
                    because we can't get a plane back to Almaty today?” I said, “We would love to
                    have you on board.” So we had the whole new Kazakhstan nuclear ministry of top
                    officials on our plane. We could talk to them and find out who they were and
                    where they came from. So that started our effort on export controls.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>I did give a press conference in the end where I said what all of us believed was
                    the case, that they had no export controls. In Soviet times all the decisions in
                    this whole area were made in Moscow. So they had no export controls as we knew
                    them. They had to develop them. I made this point and it was reported on the
                    front page of the Washington Post, that they had none, and that we had better
                    hurry up with the Nunn Lugar program in dealing with all of the other nuclear
                    successor states. This remark was not taken kindly by the new undersecretary for
                    disarmament, a Miss Lynn Davis from the Rand Corporation. She had replaced Frank
                    Wisner, and PM came under her. She wanted to know who authorized my statement
                    and had the U.S. government determined that this was the case, and why was this
                    statement being made in Almaty. That kicked off a long period of her
                    dissatisfaction with what PM was doing across the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just bureaucratic assertiveness or was there
                        something was this a policy issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Not a policy issue. The situation in Kazakhstan was clear to anyone who
                    examined the facts. I cleared my remarks in Almaty with all members of the
                    delegation which included experts from Energy, CIA, the Pentagon and Commerce.
                    Later on in our discussions in Belarus and Kiev we found out the same thing.
                    They said there was no need for any sort of local export controls under the
                    Soviet Union. So therefore when the Soviet Union collapsed all of a sudden, then
                    we had to start scrambling to establish not only export controls but other non
                    proliferation measures. There will be more about Lynn Davis a little bit later
                    maybe. So that was how we got started on that particular thing. A little while
                    later, we got permission to come to Minsk. We were very fortunate the first
                    president of the independent Belarus was quite pro American. Unfortunately, he
                    didn't last too long, but at that time they welcomed us. They admitted they had
                    no effective system. So we explained to them what they had to do. They had to
                    sign an umbrella agreement which among other things required them to sign the
                    NPT and join the IAEA. They were very appreciative and welcoming of what we did.
                    Then the next thing was go to Kiev. So on one of our flights from Frankfurt to
                    Minsk, on the plane with us was Jim Goodby. Jim Goodby was charged with safe and
                    secure dismantlement of nuclear material, SSD. So he was pestering the newly
                    independent nuclear successor states to receive his delegation. He wasn't
                    getting anywhere except in Minsk. We were on a flight to Minsk. I had just
                    received a telegram from Kiev saying Kiev would welcome a visit from Ambassador
                    Newlin to talk about export controls, but unfortunately they are not ready to
                    talk about safe and secure dismantlement. I showed the telegram to Jim Goodby.
                    He said, “Judas.” I said, “I have to go. You need to understand, I have to go if
                    they want to see me.” So we later went to Kiev several times, and there I was
                    able to finally negotiate the text of an export control agreement with Ukraine
                    which I think was the very first Nunn Lugar agreement. It wasn't finally signed
                    until sometime later together with the SSD package. Then later on export control
                    agreements were signed not only with Belarus but with Kazakhstan and then a
                    similar thing with the Russians in Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>Another major activity I was involved with was the possibility of collaboration
                    with the Russians on launching of U.S. satellites because all of a sudden they
                    had no money to launch satellites. They had all of these huge rockets. So I was
                    able to develop a policy whereby we could launch on their satellites but still
                    secure the technology of our satellites. That was one thing we were able to do.
                    Unexpected problems could pop up. The Russians had developed a unique nuclear
                    power source for their satellites called TOPAZ. NASA persuaded them to ship one
                    to the U.S. for analysis and possible licensing. When we got ready to return it
                    we found there was a regulation prohibiting the export of anything nuclear to
                    Russia. Finally, the lawyers were able to overcome the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is a period of really great cooperation
                        essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Oh yes, there is no question about it. There was great cooperation. But
                    also under Yeltsin there was great confusion. You didn't know in Moscow who was
                    doing what. They were uncertain themselves. Yeltsin made so many mistakes by
                    turning over huge properties like Gasprom and similar installations to private
                    citizens who just ran them for their own benefit and never paid any taxes. It
                    was a very difficult situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to work when we were dealing with this, I
                        would think it was a touchy time. I mean here a very proud Soviet Union
                        dissolves. I know at the top we made quite an effort not to get into what
                        was known as triumphalism. You know we won the cold war and all of that.
                        With your delegation and all did you have to work so you weren't the victors
                        dictating to the defeated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: We were very award of the unsettled situation and we were very
                    circumspect. The cast of relevant officials was constantly changing. I was also
                    then asked to go to Moscow to discuss rules of the road concerning arms sales.
                    At that time Jim Collins was the Charg�. He welcomed our delegation to come and
                    do this. I saw the deputy foreign minister. I saw the deputy head of the
                    national security council, and their joint chiefs of staff and the minister of
                    munitions and others. The Russians were very interested. They said that they
                    would like to have an agreement as to what they would sell and what we would
                    sell. In communist times all of the political decisions were made by the
                    Politburo as to what would be sold, they would sell to Egypt; they would sell to
                    Iraq; I guess they would also sell to Castro. Maybe they would give to Castro.
                    But then they would give munitions to people like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua
                    and other places that were self styled freedom fighters. I explained to them
                    that now we have a chance to sell arms in such a way that it would not create
                    bilateral problems but that we could not agree to any sort of divvying up of
                    spheres. We would have to compete on the basis of our product. We were glad to
                    tell them whom we sold to and whom we didn't and to collaborate with them. They
                    finally accepted that. So that was a fascinating time to be there. You had to
                    feel sorry for them because there were times that people that were civil
                    servants weren't getting paid. People were working in factories and weren't
                    getting paid. It was very difficult. We were able to set up an international
                    arms registry in the UN whereby major arms makers would report their sales. This
                    was a major breakthrough on transparency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then what did you do after this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well, I will come back to Lynn Davis. She wanted to get rid of Gallucci.
                    When she first was appointed I briefed her on what I was doing. I introduced her
                    to the arms manufacturers association. I thought we had a very good
                    relationship, but she wanted to replace me too. She made life hell for Gallucci.
                    Every morning E-mails to him well PM has dropped the ball again and this kind of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feeling I mean what was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: She came from the Rand Corporation. I don't know, she must have had a
                    background in Rand in disarmament and that kind of thing. But when she was first
                    nominated she was very careful. Gallucci would have her come to high level staff
                    meetings where we were discussing policy. She would attend and just sit there,
                    but she would never indicate what her views were because she didn't want people
                    on Capitol Hill thinking she was trying to perform her official duties when she
                    hadn't been confirmed. But then once she was confirmed, she really made life
                    hell for Gallucci. I give Bob credit. I think he tried to argue with her that I
                    was doing a good job with this new thing. But she finally wanted to replace me
                    with one of her friends who might have been at Rand too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, I mean I an trying to pick up here something that
                        sometimes happens. That is somebody who has earned their credentials
                        essentially in a think tank or the academic world. When they arrive in
                        government all of a sudden it is no longer just you know up in the air
                        thinking about things. I mean they have got real people doing real things.
                        Whereas often in the academic world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: You produce papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you do papers but also there are kind of sharp
                        elbows. You want to get your idea across, and these are ideas. Did you have
                        a feeling that this was in play or was there more to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: No, I think it was strictly personnel. I mean we had to report to her
                    because PM came under her jurisdiction. I think she first didn't like the report
                    from Almaty that the newly independent states didn't have export controls. She
                    didn't like that statement being made. To be made, it ought to be made by her in
                    the context of the Washington scene. Then she took great exception to the fact
                    that I had gone to Moscow to talk about rules of the road. She thought that was
                    something she ought to be doing herself. So I then left the State Department,
                    retired again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: That would have been in 1994. So when I left Jim Leonard, whom you know I
                    am sure, called me up and said, “Would I join something called the lawyers
                    alliance for world security, LAWS?” I did join them working on non-proliferation
                    projects. I also then joined a firm called Jupiter Corporation. Jupiter
                    Corporation worked closely with energy on nuclear matters. John Rooney was in
                    charge of international affairs in energy. He recruited me from Jupiter to work
                    with him on laboratory to laboratory negotiations with the Russians. The
                    Kurchatov Institute in Moscow was the Soviet Union's Los Alamos. All of their
                    early nuclear development took place there including their first reactor. We had
                    several delegations, and met with Rooney's opposite numbers in rundown buildings
                    just outside the Kurchatov Institute. The delegations also had representatives
                    from Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories. Finally they were so desperate
                    for money and funding that we were allowed into the Kurchatov Institute itself
                    and met with the director. We were able to then set up the beginnings. They
                    needed help. I tell you the difference between Los Alamos and the Kurchatov
                    Institute was amazing, everything in Moscow was run down with holes in the
                    perimeter fence and everything. They had all sorts of nuclear material there,
                    but they didn't know how much they had and where it was. So we were able to sign
                    agreements with them and get started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that bringing in money to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>NEWLIN: Yes, and then helping them also. We were able to get funding to upgrade
                    their security. The national laboratory people wanted to bring in all of this
                    high tech stuff from the United States. I said, “Well why don't we try to the
                    extent we can to get the Russians themselves to build their security system.”
                    “No, no, we have got to get this done quickly.” We then got permission to bring
                    our Russian counterparts form Kurchatov to Los Alamos. That was a big deal
                    indeed, to let Russians come in. But it all had to be under security of course.
                    They couldn't be shown anything classified . We couldn't get them into Sandia,
                    but we got them into Los Alamos. So that was it. What happened was that the
                    national laboratories said “Well why should we let Washington and Rooney run
                    this program. We are the ones that are the actors here. So we will take it
                    over.” However, it was Rooney's initiatives in the early stages that led to the
                    breakthrough. If during the Cold War someone told me one day I would enter
                    Semipalatinsk and Kurchatov Institute I would have said they were crazy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National laboratories are what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: National laboratories consist of Los Alamos, nearby Sandia. Los Alamos
                    was where the first nuclear bombs were developed. Sandia was a big place where a
                    lot of nuclear weapons stuff goes on. Hanford, Washington, and then Oak Ridge in
                    Tennessee. Then Argonne in Chicago is mainly for peaceful purposes. They don't
                    have anything on weapons but they do peaceful nuclear research. So then that
                    meant that finally things dried up there, and there was no more contracts to be
                    had. So then LAWS continued, since it was a non governmental agency and
                    privately funded. They then put together some delegations and we went and
                    followed up then on other things we had done. I have here an agreement that we
                    signed in Minsk. This was the LAWS Delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, when the time comes, we can include this in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: All of this is outside being funded by the Department of State. But when
                    the government of Belarus sent this to their parliament for adoption they said
                    this law, draft law has been drafted with the cooperation of the United States.
                    So this is just a follow on to what we had done earlier. Finally when I left PM,
                    this is what Bob Gallucci presented at my farewell reception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, the superior honor award.</hi>

                <p>For the effective promoting of arms transfer policies and persuasive and
                    persistent work at the forum for security cooperation, the conference on
                    disarmament and in Russia, the Czech Republic and Hungary, in helping conclude a
                    precedent setting technological safeguards agreement for satellite launches with
                    Russia. Michael Newlin contributed to harmonizing the seemingly opposing
                    objectives of protecting new technology while promoting increased cooperation in
                    space with Russia. His efforts and accomplishments are sincerely appreciated by
                    his colleagues and his country. February, 1994.Very good.</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it does show you the culmination of what you were
                        doing. It shows that not only is there a life after retirement, but an
                        extremely productive accomplishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I really felt that I was doing something entirely new. This was an
                    opportunity to work with former enemies, with whom we developed friendships, on
                    critically important projects.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Correct. It was the new world.</p>

                <p>NEWLIN: So that was it.Q: Well Mike this has been a fascinating time, and I
                    really want to thank you.</p>
                <p>NEWLIN: Well I need to thank you for your interest and your willingness to stick

                </p>
                <p>NEWLIN: I don't know. She didn't bulk very large on the Washington scene. The one
                    that got all the publicity and everything was Gallucci. He went to North Korea.
                    I told him, “You have achieved everything. Here you are an assistant secretary
                    of state. You go off and deal with one of the most difficult governments in the
                    world. You achieve agreement. You come back to Washington. You go over to the
                    White House and the President announces to the press, 'Here is Bob Gallucci. He
                    will tell you about it.'" I would like very much now that we are finished this
                    operation to invite you to have lunch with me at the Cosmos Club.</p>
