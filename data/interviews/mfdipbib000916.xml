                <p>Interviewed by: Paul McCusker </p>

                <p>This is Paul McCusker interviewing Ambassador Richard W. Petree on the 22nd of
                    July, 1993, at Pelham, New York.</p>
                <p>PETREE: This is Dick Petree getting set for an interview by Paul McCusker in
                    Pelham, New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Dick, I'm happy to have you here in my home in
                        Pelham. We will start with your earliest beginnings because I notice we come
                        from the same part of the country, western New York state. I was born in
                        Niagara Falls, and you were born where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I was born in Jamestown, New York, and lived for a time when I was a baby
                    in Orchard Park, of all places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We used to go down near Jamestown to the Allegheny State
                        Park which was part of my youth. Dick, how did two kids from western New
                        York get involved in foreign affairs? Let's take you, you're the
                        interviewee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Well, like so many of our generation, I think my involvement really came
                    out of World War II. I was at the time, the beginning of the war, I was still,
                    of course, in high school, and then in college in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that college in Des Moines?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PETREE: Drake University. I had graduated from high school there, public schools,
                    and then went into Drake where my father was on the faculty, and faculty kids
                    got free tuition, and it cost exactly 5 cents each way on the street car. That's
                    how I started to college. But remember this was '42-'43; the Navy caught me up,
                    and to my disgust and disappointment, I was pulled out of line in general in the
                    Navy's training programs, and sent, somewhat against my will, to the Navy's
                    oriental language school, which was then seated in Boulder, Colorado, at the
                    University of Colorado.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That can't be too hard to take in Boulder, Colorado.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Oh, no, it was a wonderful place. I met my wife there, I learned
                    Japanese; which was more important, I don't know, but both combined to have a
                    great deal to do with what happened to my career afterward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened...I notice that you studied the language for
                        a considerable period of time. Our careers were very similar. I studied
                        Italian at Stanford University, where I met my wife, and I got involved with
                        the Italian language which determined my entire career thereafter. Obviously
                        the Japanese language that you studied did that for your career too, a
                        highly successful one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Tell me about your government service, other than the Navy, I mean. What was your
                    first post.</p>
                <p>PETREE: When I finally earned enough points, or otherwise became eligible for
                    separation from the Navy in the summer of 1946, I decided that I really had to
                    go to Japan to try this language out to see out to see how I liked it. Because
                    until then I'd been programmed to go back to Des Moines, finish college, go to
                    law school, and join some mid-western company as an attorney. Whether that game
                    plan was what I wanted to do or not had to be tested against these new
                    experiences I'd gotten, particularly the language training. So I applied for a
                    job in military government in Tokyo, and I got a cable from MacArthur's
                    headquarters, through the War Department in Washington, which said they were so
                    sorry, there is no need in the occupation for a Japanese language officer. So
                    they had no job for me. But they did happen to have a job in Korea, would I be
                    interested? Well, I didn't know a great deal about Korea at that stage but I
                    remembered somewhere that they, having been colonized by the Japanese, spoke a
                    great deal of Japanese there, and it would be a good place to go and practice.
                    So I said yes. The only hitch was that I had to persuade my fianc�e that she had
                    to wait a year before we got married. That was a painful decision we both
                    made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Involving separation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>PETREE: That's right, because there was no way during those days in 1946 that an
                    unmarried person could call his fianc�e to a place like Korea where there was no
                    housing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: In Korean I was assigned to a U.S. Coast Guard team that was located down
                    in Chinhae, Korea, on the southern coast near the larger city of Pusan, which
                    became famous later on during the Korean War. As one of the three civilians
                    assigned to this Coast Guard team I was given the job of personnel officer for
                    the Korean Navy which we were then setting up, and beginning to train. And I
                    assisted in initiating all of the various training and personnel records, and
                    other programs that one has to put into motion in order to run a modern Navy.
                    And on weekends, evenings, and odd times I served also as an instructor in
                    navigation and small boat handling for Korean trainees based at this support
                    facility in Chinhae. I stayed there for a year before I went back to get married
                    and to get back into college.</p>
                <p>And that combined with language school persuaded me that I was not, repeat not,
                    going back to Des Moines. So when I went back I recast my objective,
                    academically, and began to try to fill out the political science kinds of credit
                    that I would need for a degree, a B.A., and applied for graduate schools,
                    Berkeley, Chicago, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Harvard, and I got accepted at all
                    of them because they were very busy in those days trying to set programs to meet
                    the needs of the time, particularly area studies programs which were new then.
                    And they had federal funding for most of the student body who could attend those
                    schools. So I ultimately decided on the strength of the China background of
                    people like John Fairbank, that a) I really must go beyond Japan and Korea and
                    learn about China if I was going to build a career in Northeast Asia; and b) the
                    work of those men in those days was, in my mind, pre-eminently better than
                    almost anybody else in the field. So I signed up for the two year master's
                    program at Harvard, which I finally finished in 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just finished two days before the outbreak of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Just two days before the outbreak of the Korean War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From there you went quickly into the State Department, is
                        that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>PETREE: Well, I was on a little bit of a holiday, but I had the summer before
                    served as a student intern in the Department in what was called the Office of
                    Intelligence Research (OIR), a the Division of Research on the Far East (DRF).
                    That moved me to reapply to that office which was what was intended from the
                    internship that they gave me the summer before. But at the same time the CIA was
                    just forming in those days, and they were out after almost every live body that
                    came to Washington looking for a job, particularly those who had any smattering
                    of language and other kinds of area background. So I went through long
                    interviews and testing process with the agency, and they offered me a job that
                    basically was worth quite a bit more than the Department was willing to pay.
                    But, I was not really encouraged by a lot of the questions that they asked about
                    commitment, and the kinds of things that I theoretically could be asked to get
                    involved in. So I chose to accept the State Department's invitation, and signed
                    on in the late summer of 1950 as an intelligence research analyst in DRF. And
                    since it was just the first weeks of the Korean war, I was assigned to the
                    Korean desk of DRF, along with many of our colleagues—Dick Sneider (Richard L.),
                    who has just in recent years passed away. And I worked the standard intelligence
                    assignment featuring briefing hours for senior officers in the Department early
                    in the morning, and late hours collection of all the military and other
                    intelligence required to work on presenting those reports overnight. It was
                    busy, and interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there for how many years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I was there until the Wriston program came along, and offered a chance
                    for us civil service types to switch to the Foreign Service, if we were of a
                    mind to, and along with almost all of the younger colleagues in INR, I chose to
                    switch as quick as I could. I thought it was a wonderful opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was a Wristonee too, but not from the civil service. I
                        was a Foreign Service staff officer as a lawyer at the embassy in Rome. When
                        did you get your first foreign assignment? And where was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Well, I went right on working in DRF for another two years, and finally
                    was able to dredge up one possible assignment as assistant labor attach� in the
                    embassy in Tokyo. I was assisted a great deal by a man whom I came to admire
                    tremendously, named Phil Sullivan, who was the regional labor advisor for the
                    old Far Eastern Affairs Bureau in the Department (FE). Phil later, the following
                    year, went down in a PanAm crash: the plane disappeared between San Francisco
                    and Honolulu. He and his wife were lost right after I went to Tokyo. In any
                    event, he arranged the assignment, and it involved some interim training in the
                    Department before I went to get into labor affairs. And I reported to Tokyo in
                    June of 1957, and worked at the labor business in the political section of the
                    embassy, 1957 to 1960.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The highlights of that period really had to do with learning the ins and outs of
                    reporting, in general, on labor cost factors that affected Japan's early trade
                    patterns with the United States, its competition with the United States. But
                    beyond those traditional areas of work for Labor attach� offices, I became very
                    much caught up in the political reporting on leftist worker organizations and
                    political parties in connection with the whole drive of the left-wing to upset
                    the stability of Japan which culminated in really large scale demonstrations
                    against the conservative government in the spring and early summer of 1960. It
                    was during those demonstrations that President Eisenhower's scheduled trip to
                    Japan had to be called off because of all the instability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across this fellow—his obituary, I don't know
                        where I picked it up—but Shikanai died a couple of years ago, founder of a
                        Japanese media group which, I guess, was his vehicle to confront the
                        communist-run labor unions, that he helped to destroy, virtually. I don't
                        know whether that's true or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Well, I don't think that's true. They're still in existence, but on the
                    other hand he was very much a part of the general right-wing point of view which
                    was dead-set against the liberal development of trade unions' strength in the
                    Japanese economy, and in the society. His group was called the Sankei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then it became Fiji-Sankei communications.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: That was when television came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you had your own post. That's pretty good so early in
                        your career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: In 1960, partly because of all the reporting work I did on the left-wing
                    movements during the upset period, Ambassador MacArthur selected me to be
                    principal officer down in Fukuoka which was the southwestern-most constituent
                    post in Japan. In those days we had a consulate of about 11 Americans, and 20 or
                    so Japanese, and an American Cultural Center, a USIS post, with at times two
                    Americans, and another 30 or 40 Japanese employees. So it was a fairly big post
                    in terms of those small consulates. I also had in that consular district three
                    large U.S. military bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that must have been fascinating, and the problems of
                        the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: And that was ,as it turned out, the real substance of what I did for the
                    next three years.</p>

                        lessons in tact and diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Well, it is kind of a familiar problem for lots of people in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. But there must have been also a lot of
                        consular work there—straight consular work in terms of registration of
                        Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: There was. In the district I had at that time something like 80,000
                    Americans living there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With dependents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: ...marrying, and birthing, citizen work, plus, of course, there were the
                    usual seaman cases and one thing and another that came because of the busy
                    ports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had that in Hamburg. Let's move on to your work on the
                        desk in the Department. When did you get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I went home in the late summer of 1963, and I was assigned as the officer
                    in charge of Japanese Affairs. Under the old office system, you'll remember,
                    within the Bureaus there was customarily an organization along lines of offices
                    which combined under each of the offices, contiguous or logically combinable
                    country desks. In the case of the old FE structure, I was on the Japan desk
                    along with China and Korea, and the three desks were headed up by an office
                    director who reported to the Bureau level above us. Then in 1965 the Department
                    changed the organization of the Bureaus, so that individual country desks were
                    made country directorates with somewhat more senior officers appointed to head
                    them, and theoretically a straighter shot, some authority, and some
                    participation in policy formulation directly through the Bureau. There was no
                    office level through which a desk had to negotiate its own concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was quite a radical change, wasn't it, to have access
                        to the Bureau level directly. There were a couple of big events which took
                        place during your tour on the Japan desk. One of them was, of course, the
                        reversion of Okinawa to...you presided over that, I gather.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>PETREE: I can't say that I presided over it. In the first place, Dick Sneider,
                    who was the first Country Director for Japan, was running that Okinawa show, and
                    I was his deputy. So I was very much involved in it, obviously, and it was the
                    major accomplishment of the whole four years that I spent on the desk. But,
                    you'll remember that the timing was such that reversion itself didn't happen
                    until 1972. I left the desk in 1967, and went off to the War College and then to
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all your Japanese and Chinese language training, and
                        Korean experience, how did you get shunted, shall we say, off to
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I asked for it, and the reason was simply that by 1968 when I finished
                    the War College course, I had worked on Far Eastern affairs almost exclusively
                    since 1943 and I thought I needed to look at some other part of the world. And
                    by process of elimination I ended up in the African trip of the War College, and
                    chose to go back when I was offered a job in Addis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a guy who was a political officer at the
                        consulate in Hamburg, back around that time, 1965, who said, “There's a
                        little bit of Africa in all our futures.” So you went to Addis. How long
                        were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I was there four years, and they got to be very, very long years because
                    I had a hell of a time getting promoted. I was trying to make the break out of
                    Class 3, the old Class 3, and it just didn't go very well with the assignments
                    that I drew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, wasn't there a definite slow-down at that time, as I
                        recall, in promotions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Generally speaking, I think that was true. I don't know whether it was
                    all budgetary, or whether it was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was policy. I've been reading about it recently
                        in the Foreign Service Journal. Now, I notice you were doing AID work, at
                        least part of it there, in Addis. Did you run across the fellow who was AID
                        director in Addis? You probably weren't there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Roger Ernst was there when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The guy is in our retired group in New York, Dick
                        Cashin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Oh, I talked with him early on when the New York group started to meet
                    again.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came into it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: But we didn't cross-over in Addis. I think he was there earlier than
                    I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, I'm sure you kept up your contacts with
                        the local Japanese just as I did with the Italians all over the world.
                        Wherever I was stationed in the Service I always managed to get involved
                        with the Italians because if you speak their language, you're persona grata
                        to your colleagues; in your case the Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Exactly so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you kept up your contacts, and I presume also with the
                        language. You finally did get back to the Far East though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: That was because of Okinawan reversion in 1972 and I was picked up and
                    sent on direct transfer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Addis direct to Naha?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Back to Naha. And I arrived there in early May just days before reversion
                    on May 15th, 1972. I participated in the reversion ceremony down in Naha. I
                    delivered greetings to the Okinawan people, in Japanese, which hadn't been done
                    before. It made a stir in the press and it was fun to watch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into a guy named Jay Van Swekringen, or had he
                        left already?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Sure. Oh, he had left there but I had known him while I was on the desk,
                    mostly because he was out there at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right, because I replaced him in Jakarta,
                        originally as commercial attach�, but we didn't have any commercial business
                        in Indonesia during the Sukarno period. Anyway, we eliminated the commercial
                        attach� position, but I replaced him. He'd been in Indonesia for several
                        years, and then he went off to Naha. That must have been a delicate business
                        representing the American community. The Japanese, of course, I guess, were
                        happy to have Okinawa back as part of their country. How did you find the
                        dealings with the Japanese went?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>PETREE: That was smooth. That was the smaller part of the problem. There was
                    tension between Okinawans and Japanese authorities in Tokyo, principally because
                    Okinawans have always traditionally been treated as second-class citizens on
                    ethnic grounds, if nothing else. They were terribly sensitive about how they
                    would be treated in the new era after reversion. And there was a great deal of
                    nervousness between the two of them in that early period when reversion
                    occurred. And there still is, but it has settled down now, particularly, I
                    think, smoothed out by the amount of money Japan has spent on trying to bring
                    them up to speed. They've thrown a huge amount of central government funds into
                    helping Okinawa get on its feet again.</p>
                <p>But the big job that I'll never forget was dealing with Americans. Understand it
                    was then the Vietnam war, and the focus of the military commanders, who were all
                    very, very senior people, Marine, Air Force, Army and Navy, and they were all
                    present on the island, and they'd been there for many, many years and had their
                    own environment that they had built and hated to see it go. And for the most
                    part were emotionally pitched against the State Department's foolishness of
                    trying to give Okinawa back to the Japanese. So, the big tensions that I had to
                    deal with were in every day's dealings with the feelings and the other
                    preoccupations that the military commanders tried to protect. The general thing
                    that never had occurred to me before, is that we Americans are no different than
                    anybody else in the world. We form attachments for a territory, or a turf, and a
                    place, just like the Panama Canal, and the Philippines more recently. But it was
                    true in Okinawa too. We are colonialist just as much as anybody else, and that
                    had never occurred...I always felt like that was one thing you could forget
                    about. We Americans never did those bad things, never had those instincts that
                    drove other nations. But it was true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did give the Filipinos independence, and we did give
                        the Cubans independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: The second thing I took away from that was how hugely valuable the War
                    College experience was for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you met the same people out in the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Yes. The Marine commander was a guy in my class at the War College. And
                    the Air Force guy was also the class after mine. But what's more important is
                    there seemed to be a way to talk once you've been thrown together, and it helped
                    immensely in trying to hold this show together for that first year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, rank-wise you were what, consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I was consul general, Class 2 officer at that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you ranked with brigadier general, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Yes, upper half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Plus your height, your 6 feet plus presence, shall we say.
                        You must have pulled a little weight with the military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Well, sure you do. You know how they treat the Department. If anything,
                    they're embarrassingly uneducated about who we are, where we came from, and they
                    overdo it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was always impressed with any military contact with how
                        many of them had southern accents. I felt like an outsider right there. So
                        then you went from Okinawa...did you get another direct transfer? Or did you
                        go back to the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Direct transfer up to Tokyo, and that was part of the package, the
                    agreement, to go back to Naha, take one year to set the consulate general up,
                    and then I would be permitted to go back to my area of specialization in Tokyo
                    which I did for three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were counselor for political affairs at that time.
                        That must have been equally exciting, at least you got back into your area
                        of primary interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Yes, that was important to me because I'd been away for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened of particular note? Let's put it this way,
                        what was your greatest crisis, personally, as a counselor for political
                        affairs? I don't mean on a personal life side; I mean in your job. Did you
                        have a great DCM, to start with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>PETREE: Oh, yes. Tom Shoesmith was DCM for that period, and he and I are good
                    friends, and were good friends. We went to Harvard together. He came out of DRF,
                    just like I did. While you speak of crisis, I think that the one thing I
                    remember was in 1974, or '75, just before President Ford was going to visit
                    Tokyo, the first Presidential post-war visit, and, of course, he brought back to
                    mind all of the troubles that Eisenhower ran into when his visit was canceled in
                    1960. So there was a lot of tension about whether the American President ought
                    to be permitted to come in and out of Japan with no overlay of trouble and
                    tension, and instability. The left-wing people jumped up again, and it was also
                    during a period when we were building a new chancery. So we were living in, not
                    a Quonset hut, but a temporary building near where the chancery was being
                    built.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you living, or working in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Working, as a chancery. So some Japanese radicals, activists, stood up on
                    the roof of the Okura Hotel, or near the roof, the 12th floor, and threw fire
                    bombs onto the roof of the American embassy one afternoon. I was, I guess, the
                    only senior officer in the building, and immediately after that they attempted
                    to ram the gates of the embassy with a truckload of people who were armed and
                    out for no good. They did break into the compound and we were wrestling all over
                    the parking lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Marines on hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: They were on hand helping, but, of course, the number on duty are not
                    that many, and they're not armed. But nothing serious happened, it was just
                    terribly...</p>

                <p>PETREE: No, they didn't have time. We got them out of there before anything like
                    that happened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very different from what it was in Indonesia in the
                        mid-60s. The local protection didn't exist in Jakarta in those years. The
                        crowds of paid protesters were storming the gates, and tearing down the flag
                        and burning it.</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>PETREE: The serious part of the work for the political section during that period
                    really was the movement in the U.S.-Japan relationship to try to renegotiate in
                    great detail the terms of our base presence in Japan. This involved the effort
                    to get Japan to pay more for keeping us there. They now, of course, over the
                    years have continually moved the ratio of their subsidy of the base presence
                    upward. I don't know what the current figures are, but it's something over half
                    the total cost, and it's paid for by Japan, which most American people don't
                    really know about.</p>
                <p>Those negotiations, along with the different military rules of engagement,
                    command and control understandings, etc., which came along with new weapons
                    systems—there were missiles to be accounted for. There was a different kind of
                    submarine war with the Soviets going on off Japan. And the ways of patrolling
                    and protecting Japan in the light of all of these threats involved different
                    uses of the bases than had ever been true before. And negotiating all of that
                    was really what kept us up at night. And thirdly, I'd say, very closely related
                    to this business of the pattern of the relations around our military presence,
                    had to do with the rather rapid switch of our forces from conventional weapon
                    systems to nuclear weapon systems. So that it no longer was possible to bring in
                    Army units to do something without considering nuclear weapons problems. This
                    changed the debate, the political exposure, the tensions between the two
                    governments a great deal when we came to try to negotiate around these issues of
                    nuclear powered warships, and nuclear weapons.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nuclear-powered submarines, were they allowed? And there

                <p>PETREE: We eventually got the right for them to enter port, but it has only been
                    in very recent years that one of them has been based in Japan, down in Sasebo,
                    and I think it's still there. They've reactivated a support group down
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, nuclear weapons is a very sensitive
                        subject and I can't imagine very many other places quite as sensitive as it
                        is in Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had obviously a successful tour from your point of
                        view, I think, in Tokyo that time. What did that lead to.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>PETREE: Well, then one night about 3:00 in the morning I was called, without any
                    warning whatsoever, by Bill Scranton, Governor Scranton, who was our
                    representative at the UN at that time. He had been searching for a political
                    counselor for the U.S. Mission to the UN (USUN), and he called me and asked if
                    I'd be interested, and since by that time I'd been four years back in Japan, I
                    really had to plan on going somewhere. I said, “Absolutely, I'd be interested.”
                    And he said, “Please come and talk.” So I got on the first airplane out of Tokyo
                    that noon and flew back and spent three or four days with him in New York,
                    accepted the job, and picked up what I think was really the most educational
                    experience I ever had in the Foreign Service, working at the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course that's a far cry from bilateral diplomacy, to
                        multilateral diplomacy. That's a constant battle, I think, for some people
                        who would rather be in bilateral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: That's right. I didn't know this at the time when I accepted that
                    assignment, but after I got into it I was constantly reminded, and amazed too,
                    at the degree to which our system is biased in favor of bilateral relationships,
                    and psychologically and emotionally tuned out of any previous positions to be
                    friendly, or cooperative with the effort to build multilaterally. I think it's
                    still true. I think this is a basic problem in the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's a basic problem in the country perhaps
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Part of it is because our leadership talks against it. When our President
                    wants to make something happen in the Gulf, or in Somalia, these days people say
                    that we consult, and collaborate, and build UN coalitions, etc., but the fact of
                    the matter is that when a President makes a decision, and we want to do
                    something, we still do it. There is no inclination to factor a multilateral kind
                    of approach into the way in which our policy is debated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. I found that, when I went to work
                        in the Secretariat of the United Nations, I felt immediately at home in a
                        multilateral context. Not that I was representing the United States, but
                        just the sensation of a big world with a lot of countries, and a lot of
                        people from those countries in New York. And you don't really feel terribly
                        nationalistic, or you can't feel terribly nationalistic, in the UN context.
                        I think you're right. I think the U.S. sometimes has been using the UN as a
                        figleaf. People sometimes think that the war in Korea was a UN operation.
                        Well, it wasn't, as you know, and it's kind of hard to describe it to people
                        who think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So, what sort of work were you doing at the UN?</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PETREE: It was a terribly busy kind of assignment. In the first place, the
                    administrations had changed. I went there in the spring and early summer of 1976
                    when Governor Scranton was still there, and he served the rest of the Ford
                    administration which ran until mid-January the following year, and then it was
                    Jimmy Carter who was elected. He ran the transition, and the new Permanent
                    Representative was Andy Young, the first American black ever appointed to that
                    job, and a relatively high-profile public figure, even before he started work at
                    the UN, because of his years in Atlanta, and then as part of the Black Caucus in
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>One of the things that was a part of the learning experience was that transition.
                    That was a very, very difficult time for me, and it had to do with things that
                    are still mixed up in my mind and maybe it's too complicated to talk about
                    here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't think so. Go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I was virtually the only career officer who was left in the Mission when
                    the administrations changed, by people who were quitting, going back to do other
                    things, or Foreign Service personnel who had arranged their assignments onward,
                    etc. And as sort of the memory box for the new Mission as it was made up, I was
                    in a pretty favorable position. But it was very tense around the Mission in the
                    early months because the new crowd that came in was hugely suspicious of anybody
                    who had been there under a Republican administration. This is a story that all
                    of us know, but it was the first time I had been in a place where a public
                    figure of the likes of an Andy Young, and a politician like Andy, came in to be
                    the lead figure in one of these transitions. So there was no cushioning the
                    shock as I bumped up against egos, but also the political instinct to block out
                    participation in the process by anybody who had not come with them along the
                    route of election, or of service in Congress with Andy before, or to some
                    extent, a black face. This was the first time I had ever run into this kind of
                    thing, and the uncertainties about whether I would be accepted, whether I had
                    the right to speak up, whether I would be invited to attend meetings, whether I
                    should go across the street to the UN and conduct my business in the way in
                    which I had been doing it. All of these questions introduced so many tensions
                    into my life that I wonder I didn't have a stomach ulcer before it was over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you, didn't you get an ulcer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: No, but I think it was a credit to Andy, and to some extent his crowd.
                    Don McHenry was one of his deputies, and Bill Vanden Heuvel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember Vanden Heuvel; he was a classmate of mine at
                        Cornell Law School.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PETREE: And the quality of those people eventually told. Andy was only there two
                    years; in 1978 in his own decision he made contact with the PLO representative
                    in New York one Sunday morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Instead of going to church. He should have gone to church.
                        Then it hit the fan, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Yes, it forced him out. Don McHenry took over from him. The work problems
                    of the period were first and foremost Arab-Israeli, mostly Lebanon in those
                    days. It was the time of ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...first invasion of '78.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: ...when the Israelis first moved in, and then it was establishing UNIFIL,
                    the UN force, and agonizing with the Lebanese about why they couldn't get their
                    act together, and what are we going to do? Of course, we all know the aftermath
                    and the pain, and the terrible history of that. That's what I was working
                    with.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were particularly working on Security Council affairs,
                        is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And by that time you also had your rank of ambassador.

                </p>
                <p>PETREE: '78.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We let the tape run out and we talked a little after that
                        so we will now resume on the other side of the tape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dick, the tape stopped, and you were talking about McHenry and your job as the
                    Security Council man, Lebanon, and all that. You were there when Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick came in, I take it. Was it somewhat the same operation for you, the
                    tension because of the change from one administration to another? Would you care
                    to comment on that?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PETREE: Oh, very much so. It was a very tense time. Once again, I got stranded as
                    the memory box for the Mission. I was one of the senior officers at least who
                    was left behind when administrations changed. Which I think is probably a pretty
                    good idea, but it does create a lot of tension for the person involved. In any
                    event, I found that with Jeane the ideological nervousness about somebody from
                    the old administration was even stronger, if anything. I guess I would say, not
                    so much Jeane Kirkpatrick, as the people she brought along. There were a number
                    of younger people who came with her from Georgetown where she had been teaching,
                    and those peoples' attitudes were very hostile toward what we had been doing as
                    a Mission, or what the U.S. had been doing as policy at the UN during the
                    previous administration. And they set out to change it, root, stock and formula.
                    And I couldn't agree with many of their points of view. I saw myself
                    concentrating on making sure that Ambassador Kirkpatrick understood how the UN
                    was operating in relation to whatever the problem of the moment. And rather than
                    arguing policy or reaction, to make sure that she was able to think through all
                    of the probable alternatives from the U.S. point of view, and not be swept along
                    by a group of advisors who only had one kind of a coloration in the way in which
                    they thought and talked.</p>
                <p>It was also kind of a sad time for me because the new crowd that came in with
                    Reagan...you'll remember that spring of 1981, late winter and spring, the new
                    administration just like this present administration, announced that they're not
                    going to do anything about anything until they have had a chance to study it,
                    and all the world is waiting until...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Came to a halt while they're studying.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: That was so frustrating because the places like Cambodia, and Namibia,
                    and Lebanon, and all the other places in the world simply were not going to wait
                    for some new finding by an administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, what developed shortly after that was the
                        Nicaraguan situation, that really in my view, Jeane Kirkpatrick was kind of
                        a spokeswoman for a policy which I thought absolutely abhorrent. And then
                        when we walked out of the International Court of Justice in a huff because
                        we didn't want out policies examined by any such body as the International
                        Court of Justice.</hi>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>PETREE: All of this, what happened in UNESCO, what happened everywhere through
                    the whole system with our presence, and our style, our reputation, I found very
                    troublesome. But I'll tell you, I think in looking back, there were some good
                    things that happened because Kirkpatrick came to town. One of them was that her
                    training, and her skills as an academician, meant that she was very comfortable
                    in dealing seriously with words, unlike most politically appointed Permanent
                    Representatives who very easily tended, at least, to fall into the blabbing that
                    goes on in the UN where everybody tells themselves, “Well, this is the style,
                    and if we don't blabber regardless of whether it means anything, it's not going
                    to fit the way things are done up there, and in any event it doesn't make any
                    difference, why not?” The looseness, the way in which we formulated statements
                    on behalf of the United States. You go back into the record and start reading
                    them...I think she was a cut above almost everybody who ever preceded her in

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he had a pretty good facility with words
                        himself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: She cared a great deal about it, and she fought these problems of wording
                    and expression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what it's all about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I thought that was, in general, a net plus. A second thing that I've
                    thought in retrospect, made me uncomfortable at the time; maybe you'll laugh
                    when I tell you about it. I think that, although it wasn't all personally Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick, it was the Reagan administration, the Republican kind of way of
                    looking at the world, I think, as I look back on it. I think she taught me
                    something about the extent to which the United States can and should be negative
                    in the way in which it responds in a place like the UN. We ought to make the
                    tough speech without necessarily huge emotion. We ought to tell people exactly
                    why what they're saying, or what they're doing, what they're proposing, is
                    wrong, and we ought to withhold our vote. We ought to vote the way we really
                    think, and not fall in with some kind of a majority to make the wheels go
                    around. I think her willingness to hold out in many, many tense negotiations,
                    resolutions, or this or that, the tactics of each problem as they worked their
                    way out. I think it was generally a good lesson for me. I had always felt that
                    the United States really couldn't afford to take a tough posture beyond a
                    certain point because our big hope would be to lead the rest of the world, and
                    bring them along, in a sense. If we take too tough a position, a negative
                    position, the atmosphere of what goes on in the UN, people would tend to fall
                    away from us. I think, among other things, what she taught me was that we ought
                    to be more tough-minded in the way in which we conduct ourselves in the
                    multilateral environment. And we ought to say no if that's what we really
                    believe. We ought not be apologetic about it, we ought to be prepared to explain
                    exactly why and not play tactical games about it. But we ought to be prepared,
                    and willing, to say “no” more often than it was my perception we had done in the
                    past.</p>

                        the UN. In fact sometimes I think we're too self-assertive in taking a

                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I accepted a position as president of the United States-Japan Foundation
                    which was then, in 1981, just in the process of organization, and in fact did
                    start operations on June 1st, 1981.</p>

                <p>PETREE: No, I didn't get much of a holiday. I went to work for them and it was
                    back again to my Japan roots, and that's what was really attractive about it for
                    me.</p>

                <p>PETREE: You know, a professional base from which I could work at it in a useful
                    kind of a way. My object then in those years was to do something about the
                    terrible tensions that were building between the U.S. and Japan. We perceived
                    then that that was a new level of tension we were facing, and if we didn't do
                    something about the level of communication, of understanding, of education, that
                    transpired between the two countries, we were going to let this relationship run
                    itself into the ground, and that, we thought, was bad. The Japanese side agreed
                    with it, and the Japanese conservative establishment proposed to use a one-time
                    gift, and the money was put forward by Ryoichl SasaKawa, who is still alive, who
                    was the chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. He gave a gift
                    of 10 billion yen, which in the exchange rate at the time was about $46 million
                    dollars, and that was transferred to us in four equal annual installments. And
                    so after the first four years we've built up a principal which, with our
                    investment and management of the fund, gradually built up to about where it is
                    now, which is around $90 million dollars. And an annual operating budget as a
                    foundation, making grants, giving money away to help people do things that might
                    be useful in this relationship, an operating program budget of somewhere around
                    $7 or $8 million a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now is that mainly directed to education of young
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>PETREE: It's several different things. We started out to service all the felt
                    needs that the community had in those days for exchange of persons activities
                    generally at various levels, and specialized groups, etc. We barred ourselves
                    from dealing with student exchange just because there were other groups
                    specializing in that, and instead we tried to pick up people from the societies
                    on each side to build a broader extension of the interchange that might be
                    carried on with short term visitor kinds of exchanges.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we set about the business—the first time, no other organization had
                    ever tackled this—to do something about the level of teaching about Japan in our
                    public school system all over the country. Actually I got interested in it
                    because of work that had been done in the graduate school at Stanford where they
                    had run a program in 13 contiguous counties around the San Francisco Bay area
                    near Palo Alto, to train public school teachers to teach about Japan in a more
                    sensible way. And they were beginning to have some impact in that localized
                    area. We went to them and asked whether they could replicate themselves in the
                    country, and ultimately they agreed to manage the expansion of this program to a
                    western area which would cover ten of the states in the west of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who also have a local Japanese population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Not necessarily. We're interested in Americans, whether there are any
                    Japanese living around there or not, Americans who are going to have to be
                    involved with Japan in the future, who were not getting any kind of preparation
                    in the K-through-12 education system of our public schools. We didn't do a thing
                    with private schools at all. They came along later and were very interested, and
                    still are very interested in upgrading their education capacity to deal with
                    Japan. But we dealt through regional centers. There is one at Stanford, there is
                    one at Hawaii, there was one ultimately at the University of Washington. There
                    was another one at the University of Indiana, another one at the University of
                    Minnesota, one at Columbia, one in the Carolinas, etc.; there are several
                    others. So now we have blanketed all 50 states with regional ongoing programs
                    for engaging the teachers in real time training, teaching about Japan. From each
                    of these regional organization networks, it involves a group of key teachers
                    going to Japan every summer, spending a month or more.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The third thing that we tried to do with the Foundation was to do something about
                    the lack of any senior network dialogue between the two countries. People who
                    can talk about the problems at a senior national level. We set up what I called
                    in those days, core groups, small senior expert groups to operate over a 3, 4, 5
                    year period exchanging back and forth a couple times a year, or more, to deal
                    with, for example, broad topics like energy. What do the two biggest users of
                    energy in the world think ought to be the look forward between us. How can we
                    cooperate? How can we deal with obvious problems, energy, not only nuclear, but
                    also fossil fuels, etc. We set up one to talk about how we, U.S. and Japan, look
                    at the Soviet Union right after Gorbachev came up. And we spent three or four
                    years finding out that we had vastly different attitudes toward Russia than we
                    had supposed when we began, and I think it was well worth the investment. Bob
                    Legvold of the Harriman Institute at Columbia, headed the U.S. panel that met on
                    these subjects, and a professor then at a University in Japan, headed the
                    Japanese side. It was a very useful thing.</p>
                <p>Since then this general idea of examining problem areas, or sectors, of our
                    relationship together in that way is still going on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETREE: That's right. We've got several of those going too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't seem to be producing much in the way of
                        harmony, I would say, at this point. Dick, before we leave the general area
                        of U.S. diplomatic relations with Japan, let me ask you about the apparent
                        intent of the United States to support an amendment of the charter to
                        provide at least for seats on the Security Council of both Japan and
                        Germany. There's a lot of cynicism about this stance by the United States.
                        Notice I used the word apparent support for their membership because it
                        could be that the U.S. knows full well that no such thing will happen
                        because at least two other permanent members of the Security Council
                        probably would not support it, particularly on condition they might have to
                        lose their veto power. How do you feel about the possibility of amending the
                        charter to provide seats for Japan and Germany, and probably some developing
                        country members too. I don't know whether that will get support or not, but
                        do you think the U.S. is serious about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>PETREE: I think the U.S. is serious. I think there's no cynicism. In the first
                    place, it's an old position; we've said this for a long time over many
                    administrations. But, of course, it's never been this close to reality in
                    various ways as it is now. I think that we have to do this. It's in our
                    interests, maybe more than anybody else in the world as a matter of fact, that
                    Japan be given a role, particularly a role through the UN above all. All of the
                    worries about ultimately what the end gain will be of Japan's emergence from
                    World War II; or Germany's for that matter, though it's a totally different
                    case. But I think it's in our interest to ensure that those countries, just to
                    begin with, are afforded some way to live, and operate, and satisfy national
                    aspirations within the framework of the UN. I don't think that the way in which
                    the UN is developing, particularly with the disappearance of the Soviet
                    adversary, that the veto carries with it the same emotional wallop that it used
                    to. I don't know where that will end up, but I think the way in which we have to
                    think about the veto, makes it conceivable to me within this coming period of
                    history, that we, and the British, and the French, and everybody else that are
                    going to change the way in which we think about what's called the veto. You know
                    it hasn't been used in the last couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not yet, because some of those issues haven't really
                        come up, issues on which the United States has traditionally used its veto,
                        and that's certainly an Arab-Israeli problem. How does the United States
                        convince the British and the French to not oppose an amendment in the
                        charter which they could easily do under the amendment procedure. You have
                        to have the positive votes, affirmative votes, of all five of the current
                        permanent members. So all one Permanent Member has to do is abstain, for
                        example, and it's down the tubes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: I personally think that the German and Japanese seats will be decided in
                    the context of a package which includes other countries too. I think the idea of
                    a regional permanent membership, say an India, or a Brazil, or Nigeria, who all
                    have been mentioned in the context of this debate. That will once again to some
                    degree, change the cold water: that is, the decision to admit Germany and Japan
                    per se. Secondly, I think the passage of time, and the wrestling of the UN with
                    things like the Bosnia problem, and the whole rebuilding of the concepts of
                    peace-keeping, peace-making, and-enforcing, on all of this that in the end it
                    has the effect of changing the framework within which even the Brits and the
                    French think about this. I think they will in the end have to admit that it is
                    not in their interest to cast the black ball against change per se, because they
                    can't stop the implications of the second largest economy in the world, and the
                    largest creditor nation in the world, and the engine of European growth and
                    development. They cannot stop the effects of this historically.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PETREE: Yes, and there's always going to be a bind as far as we're concerned
                    about how long? How long can we keep saying to the Japanese, “Yes, yes, we're
                    with you but...” And that's always going to be too.</p>

                    happening. Nobody seems very confident that they do know. Jerry Curtis, who is a
                    professor friend up at Columbia, is quoted as saying that this is real. That
                    this is really a benchmark event that's going on now. That the old party is
                    dead, and there is going to have to be a restructuring of the whole political
                    system. I admire him, and I have great respect for his judgment, and I think one
                    ought to pay attention to that. But nobody is sure of that judgment yet. I think
                    that it's going to take quite a long time, and that the intervening period is
                    going to be one of instability, of domestic chaos, politically and in other
                    ways, within Japan. But the drift is going to be away from the control of that
                    political party. And I think that's probably true.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's 38 years. Isn't that a long time? It's true
                        that the Christian Democrats were in power for a very long time in Germany,
                        but eventually they had to give way to the Socialist, who were not very much
                        socialist. I think the change is there, and it's good. I think it's healthy.
                        I hope it's healthy. Certainly you can't say that the Liberal Democratic
                        party has had a distinguished record in recent years with all the scandals
                        that have broken out. I think they have to have younger people...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PETREE: From our point of view, it's going to be a great adjustment that we have
                    to make when this party ceases to govern in the way in which it always has
                    before. It's not that we have done anything wrong to my knowledge at all in
                    maintaining them in power, but it is that with the familiarity, and the long
                    years of working out all of the lines of communication, and the style of
                    communication, and the formulas of agreement that have been worked out about all
                    manner of problems, large and small, have been very much in the American
                    national interests. It has worked. The policies that brought us into close
                    cooperation with that conservative party, and the conservative government, have
                    resulted in a post-war era in the Pacific which has been largely successful in
                    terms of U.S. policy, despite a couple of wars, and the troubles, and the
                    worries, etc., the fact of the matter is the troubles that we perceived at the
                    outset of that period just haven't come to pass because of the stability of the
                    Japanese development, of the Japanese leadership, sensibleness of their ideas
                    about their own domestic policies and management, and their relationships with
                    us and with the rest of the outside world. I think all of that has been well
                    done. So while some of us, I think, agree that it's high time change came, I
                    think we'd better be prepared for a lessening of the stability. It's going to be
                    a more awkward, difficult, uncertain, kind of a connection that we have to
                    manage than it has been in the past.</p>

                        see what will happen, and I'm sure you're following it very closely with
                        your tremendous background in the country, and its affairs and its
                        attitudes.</hi>

                <p>Dick, I think we should bring this to a close because we've been at it now for
                    nearly two hours. I have to say that I personally appreciate very much your
                    doing this, and I'm sure that the Association for Diplomatic Studies will
                    likewise be glad to have your comments on the record, and available to those who
                    get involved in research in the history side of our particular Foreign Service
                    policies, and foreign relations. So thank you very much. We're bringing this
                    interview to a close on the 22nd of July, 1993. Dick, glad to have you here.</p>
                <p>PETREE: Thank you very much.</p>
