                <p>Interviewed by: Dr. Chen Xiaohong </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 16, 1994</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I am Ruth Kurzbauer here at the University of Utah in the
                    International Business program and I am also a former Foreign Service Officer, a
                    USIA Officer. I served from 1979 to 1991 and then resigned in order to join a
                    non-transportable spouse who is a professor here at the University. I am honored
                    to participate in the ADS (Association for Diplomatic Studies) Oral History
                    Program and I am particularly delighted to have as my dialogue participant Dr.
                    Chen Xiaohong here at the Ph.D. program at the University of Utah in diplomatic
                    history, and formerly of the Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, China. So
                    Dr. Chen and I share many moments together in our life experiences, particularly
                    in the People's Republic of China, and I am looking forward to reminiscing about
                    my truly wonderful and challenging life in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I first came in August 1984 to work at the US embassy as the assistant
                    press officer. That is a USIA function, as your know, under the larger embassy
                    mission. And I have to tell you that prior to that time I served in Yugoslavia,
                    my first post, first as a JOT and then as what they call the ACAO, assistant
                    cultural affairs officer. My own background had somewhat prepared me for a
                    European assignment. I had studied European art and literature and come from a
                    European born mother and father. I was a music major at university, stressing
                    European classical music. So I wasn't necessarily Eurocentric, but I was
                    comfortable in a European setting, and ended up being very comfortable in
                    Yugoslavia, and we can talk about that later.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>But I have to confess that I knew almost nothing about China. I will tell you
                    what I knew before my training, and I will talk about that too. I was born and
                    raised in Cleveland, Ohio and we have a wonderful museum there, which is famous
                    for its Oriental art collection. So as a young girl or student I used to wander
                    through and just looked the way you look at great art and paintings anywhere.
                    Then, when I was an undergraduate at Yale University, I worked as the secretary
                    to two very famous American scholars of China, but that was a chance assignment.
                    I worked for Arthur Wright, who is the great scholar of classical and ancient
                    Chinese history, and an expert on the Sui dynasty. Then I worked for Jonathan
                    Spence, the famous scholar of modern China who was Arthur Wright's student. Then
                    the academic dynasty passed to Spence when Arthur Wright unfortunately died.</p>
                <p>So I had some exposure to China by typing papers and doing library index research
                    and meeting the Ph.D. students in the Chinese History program. But that was the
                    extent of my professional exposure. The rest I knew about China was what anybody
                    who is interested in the world around them learns from reading newspaper
                    headlines and occasional books and stories. But I had no other preparation than
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that you speak Chinese to an extent and the
                        Chinese you speak from my point of view is very fluent and very
                        understandable. How did you acquire that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: This is thanks to the Foreign Service Institute, which is the training
                    school for American diplomats. I got my assignment through the bidding process
                    that goes on in the Foreign Service. My first choices after Yugoslavia were
                    either in the Balkans, Eastern Europe or somewhere around the Mediterranean,
                    which at that time was my area of interest. But I had put Beijing down somewhere
                    at the bottom of the list because I thought it would be exotic and we were
                    required to distribute our bids among posts that are considered to be hardship
                    posts. So I had to put one hardship post down and at that point Beijing was a
                    greater hardship designated post. I am not sure that it is today—it probably
                    shouldn't be because of the comfort and diversity of life now possible there.
                    But in those days, 1982-83, China was not the China of today.</p>
                <p>So I put Beijing down, and lo and behold I got a cable back saying this is going
                    to be your next assignment. Then USIA officers and State officers, but I think
                    USIA officer even more so, despite junior or middle rank, and I was not a high
                    ranking officer, were allotted a full course in Mandarin Chinese through the
                    Foreign Service Institute. It consisted of one year in Washington, language
                    training and area studies, and almost a year at the extension school in Taipei,
                    Taiwan. So in 1983, I spent about ten months in Washington going to language
                    class every day, four or five hours a day. Also attending the East Asia lecture
                    series given by academics from the Washington area and elsewhere at the
                    Department of State once a week. And then, following that and passing the exam
                    for that year, I was sent with my colleagues to Taiwan for follow up
                    training.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>As you know, in the Foreign Service not everyone gets full course language
                    training. It depends on your home agency, on the function you will be doing. For
                    example, the assumption is that as a press officer, a public affairs officer,
                    the network of persons that you will encounter and will have to reach is
                    somewhat broader in number than those working in the administrative function.
                    Your mandate is to go out and make contacts and discuss and learn, etc. with a
                    broad sector of local society, so that the ability to communicate in a foreign
                    language is perceived as being an absolute requirement. So, even though I was of
                    a more junior rank, as a USIA officer, because of our agency's policy, I usually
                    received full language training. I am not sure I can speak for State, but I
                    think junior officers in consular work, although the encounter with the local
                    population is intense and daily, is not necessarily always given a full course,
                    so I was lucky that USIA's policy supported the full course. By the time I got
                    to the People's Republic I had more than a year and a half of Chinese language
                    study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I guess that was very helpful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: It worked well. I had gone through the Foreign Service Institute once
                    before and that was before my tour to the former Yugoslavia. It pains me to say
                    “the former Yugoslavia,” but we are speaking now in 1993. Anyway that was my
                    very first tour of duty, my junior officer tour and following on in Belgrade
                    with cultural officer duties. I was given eleven months of Serb.-Croatian at the
                    same Institute. Then I and two other colleagues, both from the State Department,
                    were sent out on kind of an experimental language intensification program to
                    live on the land, as it were, with Yugoslav families for three months. We were
                    the first ever selected, I believe, and I am not sure if the program ever
                    continued. After our formal training in Washington, FSI picked three of us to go
                    out and find a Yugoslav family and just live with them and interact for several
                    weeks in the hope that that would intensify our language use before we actually
                    got into the embassy and began our diplomatic work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't do that in Taiwan, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: No, not in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get your training in Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: There is the AIT, American Institute in Taiwan, a language school
                    extension, if you will, of the Foreign Service Institute. It is a formal school
                    attached to the diplomatic training process. It used to be in T'aichung and then
                    moved to Taipei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were again going to classes over there further
                        learning the language.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Right. Of course, the purpose of sending us abroad was the hope that
                    after 6 hours at language school every working day and lots of homework, that
                    living in Taipei we would get out and do things in the community and use Chinese
                    in the process. And I think to a certain degree that happened. We were a group
                    of between 20 and 40 students from various US government departments doing the
                    advanced Chinese program. We developed strong group rapport and friendships, so
                    we had a nucleus of friends and used to do a lot of things together in Taipei
                    city. But we also took off on our own.</p>
                <p>For example, I was trained as a musician before I went into my adult work, so I
                    hung out with the Taiwanese classical musicians. I went to art galleries and met
                    artistic types. In many cases the common language was Chinese, although the
                    younger Taiwanese speak English very well, so it was sometimes a hard pull to
                    speak in my limited Chinese and not have my Taiwanese friends break out into
                    perfect English. But it worked. You just lived a normal life. I had no car there
                    so I took buses. My living quarters were up in the suburb of Taipei, which is up
                    on a hill above the city, so in order to get down into Taipei City I had to take
                    local buses and find my way around. It worked very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is always a prejudice in society against women when
                        we talk about a certain kind of work. I think at your time when you made
                        your decision to get into diplomatic service, was that a challenge, or how
                        did you make your decision that you were going to get into the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Well, it is interesting, because I have to confess that for me the
                    decision was on one hand, I think, deep, but in a way unconscious and on the
                    other hand serendipitous. I have always been interested in international things.
                    Most everything I did as a student or as a person on my own had some
                    international link. I was playing European music when I was a student, or
                    assisting foreign students in adjusting to university life. I was just always
                    interested in the world in a broad dilettantish way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have family that impacted you that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Yes. My parents were born in Vienna and escaped after the Nazis
                    occupied Austria. A year later through a series of miracles and stories they got
                    to America. They came from the “Mittel Europa” culture, the culture of the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire...literature, art and music, etc. But they also had a
                    curiosity about the world. And they taught me a strong respect for people
                    regardless of what function a person might hold or what status in society, or
                    where they came from. I think that was genuinely built into the way they looked
                    at the world. I never had a car when I was a teenager, we didn't have color
                    television then, I think they expressed more the intellectual and cultural side
                    of life. But we had trips in the car and traveled across the United States a
                    lot.</p>
                <p>I went to England on a local Cleveland Rotary music scholarship when I was
                    sixteen. Maybe that was where it accelerated because I landed at the airport and
                    had the address of a music students' resident hall, which was a commercial
                    venture, not attached to a university. I had already organized the possibility
                    of studying music with a famous piano pedagogue, but who was also not attached
                    to a school. I was introduced to her by an American professor who said, “I
                    recommend that you go and study for a semester, if you can find the funds, with
                    this famous European piano instructor.” So that was arranged. But when I got off
                    the plane I had the address of a boarding house and the address of my teacher,
                    whom I was to meet a week later, and that was it. I had never been out of the
                    United States before. Of course I was in an English speaking country, but
                    nothing else was set up. Yet, it worked. I had such a marvelous experience. I
                    ended up in a boarding house living with international music students from
                    everywhere in the world. A lot from Commonwealth countries. So for the first
                    time I met South African blacks, Malaysian Chinese, etc. I think that experience
                    was probably the first conscious beginning of my general interest.</p>
                <p>But going back quickly to the Foreign Service, I was working at Yale University
                    as an administrator in the History Department after I went to school there and
                    was thinking, “Well, what can I do interesting in the world?” Someone mentioned
                    the Foreign Service exam and I thought it sounded good to me and took it. But it
                    wasn't a really deeply thought out process that led to my decision to apply to
                    the diplomatic service. It was: “Well, I have always been interested in the
                    world, and here is somebody telling me about all you have to do is register and
                    take a Saturday morning and try an exam. You pass, maybe not, but you don't put
                    your life on hold and radically alter your plans in order to prepare for the
                    exam or in order to take the first steps.” I think that is one of the nice
                    things about our diplomatic service, the entry process is very egalitarian I
                    feel because it is based on an exam that is offered broadly throughout the
                    country and abroad to Americans who might be living overseas. It reminds me of
                    the SAT and the GRE exams that you might encounter. So, if you have a
                    broad-based interest in a lot of things you have a good chance of at least
                    passing the written exam. At the same time you don't have to take nine months of
                    a special course in order to prepare. It is something you do parallel to the
                    main course of your life, which I think makes it accessible to a broader range
                    of people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you have said, I have the feeling that you had
                        been by that point a very compatible person who was willing to meet
                        challenges. Did you think of yourself as a woman at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: No, to be honest I didn't. And that may be...I don't know if that is a
                    failing or a lack in my own...how would I put this...sense of society and
                    history, if you will. Maybe because in my own personal experience...I went first
                    to a music conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland for my college training and there
                    it was how much did you practice and how good a musician were you. As students
                    there was no particular feeling of male students having a priority, that this is
                    a classically male field. Then, when I went to Yale University, I was in the
                    first class of undergraduate women that was admitted when Yale opened their
                    undergraduate doors to women. Up until that time the graduate school was open to
                    women but not the undergraduate school. So in a sense we were a pioneering
                    class, but I felt it was a very collegial camaraderie environment. I didn't feel
                    any particular bias, either more special or less special.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you just felt like you were a person who could meet any
                        kind of challenge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I think in a way I probably didn't realize how great the challenges
                    were. And also because I sort of did it, you know, it was my Saturday morning
                    attempts, rather than I have worked seven years to be a lawyer and now comes the
                    bar exam and I stand or fall on this, my career is on the line. I really didn't
                    know what to expect, to be honest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's great, I think you just got into the right
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: It was luck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since I come from China I am most interested in your years
                        in China. After your training in Taiwan, you got an assignment to work in
                        Beijing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Right. The assignment predated the training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew the assignment and took the training in order to
                        fulfill the assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Exactly. And it was training not in the PRC but training outside the
                    PRC. Most of the diplomats being trained in that group were destined for
                    Mainland assignments at that point, although others were going to Hong Kong and
                    Taiwan. The thinking was, and I think it was true for all three agencies that
                    feed into the Foreign Service, by and large that if you have training in a
                    language you do some of your tours of duty in one region of the world and other
                    assignments would be in another region entirely, unlike foreign services of some
                    other countries where they have deep specialists. I remember the former Soviet
                    Union diplomatic service. I met quite a number of USSR diplomats when I was in
                    Yugoslavia and they were actually area specialists. They were in a way like you,
                    Ph.D. level or intensely trained geographical specialists and they would stay
                    much of their diplomatic career in the area of their geographic specialty. Many
                    of us in the U.S. service are more general and taken from here and put there and
                    taken from there and put here. But the chances of going back to an area,
                    especially like the Chinese speaking area, once you have received hard language
                    training, are high. In fact many of my colleagues have gone from Beijing to
                    posts outside China and then back to another China post or related post. So
                    there is some long term continuity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because when one acquires the language ability, it is
                        easier to use that person in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: But I, myself, had never been to Mainland China and as I mentioned
                    before and except for the training that I received at the Foreign Service
                    Institute I had no academic or professional background in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so my next question is besides the language you
                        learned about the history and culture of China...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Yes, we had an area studies series that Dr. Howard Spendelow from
                    Georgetown University was the coordinator of, a professional US academic Chinese
                    specialist. These were weekly lectures, two or three hours a week on various
                    aspects of Asian history, economics, politics and then more intensely focused on
                    China during the second half. So it was almost like a graduate survey course.
                    The participants were diplomats, including high ranking ones and junior officers
                    and other agency personnel, but it was basically a survey. I learned a great
                    deal, but it wasn't an intensive Ph.D. seminar with specialists all together
                    investigating deeply a certain topic; it was to give a broad background
                    introduction to the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you learned from the training program in that regard
                        did you find out that was exactly what China was when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I will tell you about stepping into China, I remember this vividly.
                    One of the things I remember vividly is reading...you have to realize at that
                    time, we were in training in 1982-83...I left Yugoslavia in August of 1982 and
                    then went into the first half of the language program in Washington, 1982-83,
                    and then the second half in 1983 in Taiwan. I imagine you were in China at that
                    time, but looking back relations had barely been established and barely at a
                    cordial level. There was not much interaction, travel, movement back and forth.
                    You can't compare it to the situation today at all. There were very few general
                    books on contemporary China that had any roots in contemporary reality. There
                    were views of China by experts who had been outside the country for many years,
                    but there were very few people who had actually been there. Some Canadian
                    specialists, some folks from countries who had had longer diplomatic relations
                    with the PRC than we had, but not very much. Nothing to equal the wealth of
                    articles and periodicals and books and popular magazines that you have today,
                    even articles in the general press. So one book that had just come out was Fox
                    Butterfield's book on China, which I think is called, “Alive In The Bitter
                    Sea.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was very controversial in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I will be interested to hear your reactions to it because I read it
                    knowing only general things about China. I read Fox Butterfield's book about his
                    own experiences as a journalist in early reformist China, if you will. I am sure
                    that he wrote them exactly as he experienced China. Some of the incidents that
                    have to do with surveillance and caution and the difficulty of interaction
                    between foreigners and the Chinese I am sure happened. But the image from
                    that...if he published it in 1982 then the material was gathered in 1980-81...I
                    think back to China 1981 just in a very anecdotal and not very deep image, but
                    in China then the Beijing Hotel was the landmark and the most comfortable and
                    most luxurious hotel in Beijing and that is where foreigners would hang out
                    when, you know, you needed to kind of group together and get a perspective on
                    your new experiences in China. And it was from what I read, and from what I
                    remember even going to the Beijing Hotel, it was very Chinese in many ways.</p>
                <p>Now, today, you go back and there is some symbolic contrast here; think of the
                    China World, the sheraton, the Jonglun, which is no longer even a major hotel.
                    One luxury hotel after the other! Obviously that is not all of China and not a
                    symbol of a nation, but it is a symbol of changes, evolution and prosperity of
                    society. In my time, in luxury hotels Chinese nationals could not easily enter
                    unless they were accompanied by a foreigner or had an official reason to be
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had to show our ID.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Now that has disappeared. If you have the bucks you go! That was not
                    Fox Butterfield's China. I think he had a great affection for the Chinese, but
                    his time was both challenging, exciting and stressful, which I think is probably
                    a very realistic way of describing experiences in China as it was unfolding from
                    cultural revolution to the period we are in now. So my image of China from his
                    book and others was darker. I had just read about the cultural revolution and
                    the great dislocations and the terrible traumas. You look back twenty years
                    before then, the Great Leap Forward, and then you look back again to war-time to
                    Japanese invasion and then you look back again beyond that and there is civil
                    war. So the imagery to me was one of turmoil and darkness. If somebody asked me
                    how I imagined China, I would have said regimented, everybody in lock-step,
                    everybody wearing the same clothes, everybody reading the same book—or turmoil
                    or anarchy! These two kinds of extremes.</p>
                <p>I know that is an emotional image, not a scholarly or professional image, but
                    that was my view. So at first when I was assigned to Beijing, I didn't know what
                    to expect and I didn't think it was going to be an easy assignment. I thought it
                    would be isolated, difficult materially, but more importantly emotionally
                    isolated. There would be foreigners, officials, China and a kind of gap in
                    between, only bridged occasionally by formal interactions. So my view, I think,
                    was cautious, nervous and uncertain. It was very interesting, when I got
                    there...again this was maybe an extreme, but for me it sort of sums up how
                    unexpected things really turned out for me, at least personally. I got to the
                    Beijing airport in August 1984, got off the plane and the embassy always sends
                    an officer or staff member already residing in the country to meet the new
                    arrival regardless of the rank or function the new arrival holds. I think it is
                    an important custom. Well, there waiting for me was a member of our USIA section
                    and the embassy driver. We got through customs without a problem, through the
                    diplomatic entrance. I tried out my Chinese for the first time in the PRC when I
                    said, “Hello” to the custom official who was looking at my passport. I got in
                    the car and the first thing I noticed, and that was when my imagine began to
                    turn a little bit...in Fox Butterfield's book he talks a little bit about how
                    the trees had been cut down in Beijing under Mao because of the anti-sparrow and
                    anti-pest campaigns. But as you know along the road from the airport into town,
                    which takes about 40 minutes, are willow trees and it was all green. I found
                    that interesting.</p>
                <p>Okay, then we get to the Jianguo Hotel, as you know, which was at that time the
                    only international joint venture hotel. I had expected, gee, I knew I was going
                    to be living in a hotel because there was not enough space in the diplomatic
                    compound. Relations were expanding and the embassy was growing and, as you know,
                    diplomatic personnel in Beijing lived in Chinese built diplomatic compounds
                    either in Jianguomenwai or Sanlitun, so you have nations' diplomatic corps plus
                    most of the journalists living there. It is kind of a canton system, sort of
                    like keep the barbarians all together! Anyway there was not enough space because
                    relations were improving and officers and staff were being added, more programs
                    and interaction. So many of us newcomers, especially those of us who were
                    single, were housed in hotels for a couple of months. So I was housed in this
                    new joint venture hotel, the Jianguo, which was my beloved home for eight
                    months.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Another image of China that started to turn my mind even more was as we pulled up
                    to the Jianguo, there outside were staff members, probably from the hotel,
                    getting on bicycles and bicycling off home. But there inside, as I walked in,
                    was this beautiful Chinese musician in the lobby of the hotel in a white satin
                    gown! I will never forget that. My image of China was Fox Butterfield, Mao
                    revolutionary oppression, regulation wear of green, green, green, blue, blue,
                    blue, everybody in high necked tunics. But I walked into the hotel and there is
                    this beautiful young musician wearing this silk gown with sequins, sitting at a
                    grand piano playing Brahms. And I thought, “Well, this is not quite the way I
                    imagined it.” Again I realize this was not all of China, but it was a small
                    piece of another part of China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least you are in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I think then this was “foreigner's China,” if you will, but it has
                    expanded now. Just a few weeks ago I got a New Year's card from the Shenyang
                    Conservatory of Music, which is the major Chinese music academy of Northeast
                    China—Manchuria. We had many cordial and successful cultural exchange type
                    programs between our U.S. Consulate in Manchuria—my section—and the Shenyang
                    Conservatory. On the New Year's card I just got from the Conservatory director
                    is a picture of the brand new Shenyang concert hall. As you know, Shenyang is
                    not the culture capital of China, but the people have invested in a cultural
                    center which is aimed at presenting classical, Western and well as other kinds
                    of music, and it has become a popular place to be! You wouldn't have seen that
                    in 1976 or imagined that the mayor of Shenyang would be opening the Shenyang
                    Conservatory of Music's new concert hall with a Beethoven symphony. It would
                    have been unthinkable under Mao.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is what we say is the opening up of China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Or that “Farewell My Concubine” is a best selling film in the United
                    States. These interactions are growing and the world is being enriched. I think
                    I was there at a wonderful time because 1984-85, as you know, was a time of
                    expanding relations. New excitement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: So the Jianguo and Great Wall were the two major international
                    business type hotels in Beijing in 1984. The USIA section and the embassy rented
                    the ball room and had an election party where beamed in by satellite were the
                    election returns from the US. And for the first time since 1949 we were able to
                    invite whole classes from China's number-one university, Beijing University,
                    political science classes and international studies classes of Chinese students
                    who came with their instructors to an American embassy function at the time of
                    election. This was new. It had not been possible before. So there was a lot of
                    excitement in these kinds of first encounters. So I came at a very auspicious
                    time.</p>
                <p>Of course there were restrictions and there were difficulties and there also was
                    the “spiritual pollution” campaign. Relations would go up and down. But the
                    overall contact possibilities were expanding at that point. So it was really
                    exciting for me to be there then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think you were actually in that country at the
                        right time if you wanted to see the development of relations between two
                        countries. China and the United States had had a relationship before, but
                        there was a long time cut off, and it was really picking up speed at the
                        time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: One of the interesting things for me was to meet some of the older
                    Chinese academics, some in government institutions, probably some in your own
                    institution, who had gotten their early training at US universities before the
                    Second World War and then had either been caught up in the war in China or here
                    in the United States and had not been able to get back to China during the
                    Japanese occupation, and then came back to China in the late forties to help
                    build the new China. Of those I met there was a great deal of joy in the ability
                    to be able to communicate again with Americans scholars or bridge the gap that
                    had existed for the last 40-50 years. So someone who had spent his or her youth
                    training in Oberlin College or Harvard and then had gone through all the series
                    of events in China that we know about and had been cut off from broader world
                    ties, now able to reach back out...it was a very moving thing. People like me,
                    American officials, not because of our own personal worth, but because of the
                    function that we held and what we represented, were recipients of that joy. And
                    there was a special emotional quality to some of the encounters and some of the
                    programming that we were able to initiate or promote or extend. Because of that
                    it was like friends finding each other after a long, long separation.</p>
                <p>Now, obviously that group of Chinese scholars had not known me, but I
                    represented, or my colleagues represented, that other world for which they had
                    affection also. It was a very moving thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and moving also not only because they were separated
                        from a country where they spent their youth, but also because of the time
                        period they had just gone through. Remember, if they had training or
                        education in the United States, most of them suffered one way or another
                        during the Great Leap Forward or the cultural revolution, which lasted more
                        than ten years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Some would tell me their experiences and some would gloss over them by
                    saying “that that was then and now I am still alive and am here.” But you are
                    absolutely right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in a lot of ways, their joy reflected not only their
                        personal feelings, but really on behalf of the whole country. The country
                        was changing from an entirely isolated radical phase into a phase which was
                        hopeful at least.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Towards great normalcy and stability. It is interesting because if I
                    compare interactions in China to interactions in another Communist
                    country...actually I served all my tours in countries that were Communist
                    politically. People used to tease me that Personnel must have thought I was a
                    Communist because every assignment I got had something to do with Communism.</p>
                <p>But in Yugoslavia it is interesting, the personal interactions...of course, as
                    you know, Yugoslavian Communism had a different face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tito Communism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Although there was certainly surveillance of certain personnel, no
                    question about it, we couldn't feel it but it was understood. We just couldn't
                    run around and not be observed by some aspect of security or some aspect of the
                    Party. But there was no overt restraint in personal relationships in Yugoslavia
                    then. So, for example, I sang in a Yugoslav choir. I had Yugoslav friends as I
                    have friends here in Salt Lake City, perhaps more! I went to their homes; I went
                    to their weddings; stayed up all night and drank tea and brandy in the kind of
                    Latin Quarter, the Bohemia cabaret district of Belgrade called Skadarlija. In
                    those days (unfortunately I am sure there have been massive change after all
                    that has happened there now), but it was a kind of live and let live city with a
                    lot of drinking and sitting around with friends in cafes. Kind of an old style
                    European cafe life in a way. A lot of hanging out and window-shopping and
                    socializing. Group social activities were very strong in those days. And there
                    was no constraint for me as an American official to do all that with Yugoslav
                    friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Now in China in 1984-86 it was still different. No matter the curiosity, the
                    interest, and in fact, indeed in many cases, the friendship and the affection, I
                    think that our Chinese official colleagues and unofficial friends, let's say
                    students or musicians, had to be cautious and were. So going to someone's home
                    was extremely rare. At the end of my tour of duty, I was invited to private
                    homes, but then I was “safe” because I was leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I left in August 1986.</p>
                <p>I went to the homes of several mid-ranking government cadres, but...part of it
                    may be that people live in small quarters and it is very hard to invite somebody
                    to such cramped spaces. I think there was a perception that we can't invite a
                    Westerner who comes from a pretty luxurious style of life into our one-room
                    apartments! Maybe there is some “saving face” involved. But I think there was
                    also political caution. That you know probably better than I. Certain
                    interactions were authorized by a work unit because they were professionally
                    necessary. But in this new period when the rules were changing within Chinese
                    society, but were not clear, people most often, I think, needed to be cautious
                    so that they wouldn't over-step some kind of unwritten rule that they might not
                    know about! Are my perceptions accurate?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. Especially when you are talking about a certain
                        section of people. I am afraid that even if they wanted personally to invite
                        you or felt there was no constraint on them in terms of inviting an American
                        friend, they still have to tell their boss or authority that that is what
                        they were going to do and is that all right. Sometimes they will get an easy
                        okay, sometimes they would say that it has to be reported somewhere and will
                        get an okay afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I think it affected some of our Chinese colleagues in terms of
                    professional programs, they had to receive professional approval in order to
                    participate in the various USIA programs. Now when I was in Shenyang, five years
                    later...of course you know that Liaoning is a pretty conservative province, it
                    is a military district headquarters, etc....I found a great deal of possibility
                    in official programs that we did which were somewhat new or fairly new. We were
                    able to expand in a number of cultural and educational and press exchange areas
                    which surprised me. A lot of it, I think, was due to our staff. I would like to
                    say a word about them if I can. And there were, I think, real professional and
                    personal likings which developed. Not only with me but with my consulate
                    colleagues as well. But still that caution prevailed. When I left I had a whole
                    slew of invitations. Not only banquets from institutions and work units which
                    are par for the course, but from individuals with whom I had worked and who then
                    told me that they sort of needed to wait until I left in order to go that extra
                    step. If they had been too friendly on a personal level with me or American
                    colleagues during the course of our stay, it would have been a little too much,
                    maybe too risky. They were welcome to participate in official doings, but not to
                    extend that too much into a more personal interaction.</p>
                <p>For example, a professor at a university. We had a number of programs for
                    professors of English or American literature which we had established in the
                    consulate. We invited both American teachers of English who lived in China at
                    the time and Chinese professors of English and American literature from various
                    universities in Northeast China. And we had a number attend our regular monthly
                    “Literary Salon” that I and my staff established. But those same professors who
                    were able to come to the consulate for those events, which was quite unusual
                    actually, would not feel comfortable enough to say, “Well, come over to my
                    apartment on campus.”</p>
                <p>Now in 1994 I understand that as far as the American business and academic
                    communities it is pretty much an open door. Whether or not there is still
                    caution towards an American official, it probably exists among some, but if you
                    are a non- official foreigner there is very little that you can't do and very
                    few places you can't go in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the fact that you were in Shenyang and there
                        at that period of time which was six months after Tiananmen Square...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Actually it was almost nine to ten months after Tiananmen. I arrived
                    at a time when our political relations were still not all that cordial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So as a representative of the United States government,
                        did you feel anything that had something to do with the Tiananmen Square
                        incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Well, that is an interesting question because as an officer in the
                    public affairs, public diplomacy section of an embassy, namely the USIS
                    mission...we have a twofold mission: one is to present the vast spectrum of
                    American society, culture, politics, intellectual life, etc. to the foreign
                    public, whichever country that may be, and two, to help bridge the knowledge gap
                    between our own American public and a foreign culture and society. That is the
                    overall mandate. We do it through a variety of programmatic means. One way might
                    be assisting a school like the University of Utah that wants to expand an
                    academic program with China, in making contacts with local Chinese universities
                    that might be appropriate partners. Others are formal programs which are
                    mandated by Congress like the supervision of the Fulbright Scholar Exchange
                    program or the international visitor program that brings leading younger
                    professionals from a foreign country to the United States for a month to meet
                    American counterparts in the hope that they will establish an ongoing
                    intellectual and professional dialogue. This has nothing to do with the
                    government, but we are the facilitators of that introduction.</p>
                <p>Other things are social science and cultural and educational types of programs
                    that basically bring both sides, protagonists and professionals, together. The
                    media function, of course, is presenting the American foreign policy point of
                    view, distributing material on issues that might be difficult between the US and
                    China, for example, trade imbalance, MFN. Part of my job was to talk to the
                    local journalists and people who could spread information in the Northeast about
                    why does America have this particular position, what are the trade issues, and
                    explain to government officials of those provinces and also to media people, our
                    positions and viewpoints, etc. So, a variety of activities and tasks.</p>
                <p>But the bottom line is presenting America. Now presenting America, obviously, was
                    not the most popular thing to do from the point of view of an official Chinese
                    government ministry at that particular time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is exactly so. Your feeling about what the government
                        was supposed to do....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Of course we also had an understanding that we were supposed to go out
                    there...that all diplomats are learners as well as doers. We are there to learn
                    and understand as best as we can in a limited way. What is the thinking in that
                    local society? What are the problems and goals? What are the issues from the
                    point of view of that country, its population, its society? So it is a two way
                    mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you have to feedback to the government so that they
                        would make appropriate...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Yes, diplomats in many ways send reports back to Washington that are
                    then reviewed by the policy makers and hopefully are factored into the next
                    policy stage. So we promote and listen. But the promotion function, you are
                    right, how do you do it when officially your host country is not all that
                    encouraging of your method and mission? And I think what happened in my section
                    was that I was lucky because I dealt in some aspects with less controversial
                    issues. I had in some ways in some programs “goodies” to hand out. Some of the
                    things we were interested in doing dovetailed with China's own stated political
                    goals of education development... development in science, development in
                    economics, development in industry...so that as a representative of the cultural
                    and educational side of the USG, I think that some of our programs or contacts
                    were encouraging of Chinese development and that made it a little bit easier to
                    get in the door.</p>
                <p>For example, the Northeast universities want to train more of their faculty in
                    English. So I think they were more likely to respond to the kind of programming
                    that we were able to initiate and to continue, both what we designed on the spot
                    in our consulate and what we got from Washington and then presented, because it
                    agreed with Chinese orientation and development.</p>
                <p>But, not all. Sometimes there was the problem of how do you work it. A lot of
                    times you had to go through the “back door” and then through the front door.
                    Every provincial government, as you know, has a “waiban,” a foreign affairs
                    office that is suppose to facilitate and assist foreign activity in that area,
                    but also keep an eye on it and make sure that what is being done is not contrary
                    to the perceived interests of China or the provincial government. I believe that
                    most of the cultural and educational and scientific and media institutions in
                    Northeast China with whom our consulate had either existing relationships or
                    expanded relationships had to report to their provincial government or at least
                    their institutional foreign affairs office the contacts they might have with us,
                    or the plans that they might have to do some program with the American
                    consulate.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>So I decided with the help of my staff, who were fantastic..as you know the
                    American embassy and consulates are directed by the American officer and
                    American professional staffs that come through the American diplomatic service,
                    but the work really rests on the foundation of local national employees. This is
                    the case in all of the countries in which we have diplomatic missions, not just
                    China. You will have, for example, cultural advisors, economic advisors, media
                    assistants who are nationals of the host country, as well as the janitors, the
                    drivers and administrative staff. So really you have a small layer of American
                    diplomatic personnel supervising and working with a larger group of host country
                    nationals. There have been arguments and I have read in our newspapers and in
                    Congress about the wisdom of that. Shouldn't a diplomatic mission be run by
                    Americans?. Isn't that safer, more secure? It keeps our policies done and
                    executed by Americans. Frankly I think it would be impossible to do the most
                    effective work without the assistance and cooperation of Foreign Service
                    Nationals. They provide a window of understanding into the culture and even are
                    vital in pragmatic things. In some countries you just can't go to the counter
                    and buy a train ticket, you need to know how to maneuver and where to go to get
                    the most efficient service and whom to butter up! No American flying in for two
                    years is going to know that.</p>
                <p>In the case of China, I think the foreign national employees were in a difficult
                    position, but they gave outstanding service to the development of bilateral
                    relations and I will tell you why if I can be frank. They were assigned to the
                    American consulates and embassy by the Chinese government's Diplomatic Service
                    Bureau. In France, for example, if the US embassy needs a cultural advisor or an
                    education assistant, you advertise in the French newspaper and look at the
                    resumes. It is just like you would hire in the U.S. If your desiderata is
                    somebody with a PhD in American Studies who has worked in academic exchange
                    programs, then you look at the resumes that come in and hire, just as you would
                    if you were running an American business or big US institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without any institutional censorship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Exactly. But in China the government selects people to fill the
                    function on a two, three, four, five year contract as necessary, not only in our
                    diplomatic mission, but all foreign missions that rely on foreign nationals.
                    Now, for example, the Soviet mission did not hire any Chinese local staff. They
                    were staffed completely by Soviet employees from drivers all the way up to the
                    senior adviser. But most western missions have a mixed diplomatic supervision
                    and local staff, which I think all in all works quite well.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>So the staff we received was staff from the Chinese government. Now, obviously at
                    a time of political tension or political disagreement or differences, foreign
                    national employees are caught between two masters. On the one hand the job is to
                    help bridge the gap and help. If I the officer am doing a program to promote
                    American music or to promote understanding in new developments in American
                    environmental science, my staff member is trying to get an audience or get the
                    appropriate format or create the right atmosphere to promote these ideas and
                    this information. At the same time there is probably a certain amount of
                    pressure on that person from his other supervisor, meaning the Chinese
                    Diplomatic Service Bureau, not to go too far to push a positive American
                    program. I'm speculating, obviously none of my Chinese staff sat down and told
                    me that, but I think it is pretty obvious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we are talking about the right period of time,
                        because if we both think about the primary reason for the Tiananmen Square
                        incident from the point of view of the Beijing government, the explanation
                        or interpretation was the students had had too much Western ideas or had too
                        much Western influence and that is why they were demanding democracy and
                        brought the country into chaos in 1989. So there was some kind of a measure
                        after that to try to reduce it. From your point of view the program is to
                        promote understanding, from the Chinese point of view it is to expand
                        contact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: So it is a difficult task for the American officer, but I think even
                    more of a difficult task for the Chinese employee of an American or other
                    foreign mission who has to really look at two missions, one is the mission of
                    his own political society and the other is the mission of the foreign consulate
                    which, to simplify greatly, is to expand contact and understanding.</p>
                <p>Maybe because I had exceptionable people on my staff, or they were genuinely
                    dedicated to...I think they genuinely believed that China and America are two
                    great countries and there is a lot that can be shared. That may have inspired
                    some of their really outstanding efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't personally encounter any difficulties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Oh, there were difficulties but my staff always advised me how to get
                    around them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were able to get around them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: But had I not had the staff...that is probably my point and I want to
                    emphasis the value of the Foreign Service National to diplomatic work. At least
                    the diplomatic work we do in many countries. Because without these employees I
                    could be the same person with the same mission with the same diplomatic training
                    from Washington and with the same intermediate Chinese language fluency, but I
                    would not have known whom to go to for “permission,” or to invite so-and-so
                    because that will help promote the program among the provincial government
                    officials, etc. So it was a very extensive personal network that the staff was
                    able to advise me on. And in China, as you know, that helps to get things done.
                    Now, maybe it would make no difference if I was in New Zealand. If my staff
                    member says to me...let's say I want to do work with the New Zealand Institute
                    of Animal Technology (I am making that up). So as a diplomatic representative I
                    have my staff call up the director of the university or the vice president for
                    external relations and say, “We have this really interesting program between
                    American animal technologists and we have some scholarships or we have some
                    dialogue possible, would you like to look into cooperation or would you like to
                    be introduced,” I don't think there would be any... For them it would be a
                    matter of do they have the interest in the topic, the time or resource to invest
                    in it, is it productive for them intellectually. But in China at the time it was
                    more than is it productive intellectually. Is it political correct, is it useful
                    in local terms, is it politically suspect? There were many, many other levels.
                    Many people in the Northeast had not had extensive contact with the outside
                    world, unlike institutions in Beijing or institutions in Shanghai or
                    institutions in Canton, the great centers. Northeast China, except for Russia
                    and Japan, was not the center of great external relations with the rest of the
                    world. Manchuria was off there, cold and remote. There were many institutions
                    who had little or no external contacts, not only with Americans but with other
                    countries. And we were just beginning to build. So there was caution, hesitation
                    and uncertainty: was it okay to proceed this way, was it useful. The advice that
                    I got from the staff on personal connections, who is important, what key
                    institutions might be interested and which might not be, what did it mean if
                    somebody said, “no.” Were they offended or were they just politically unable to
                    respond? Or did I just phrase my program in a way that was incomprehensible?
                    What were all the meanings and results of actions. That was invaluable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The staff you are talking about is the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: That's right. My cultural assistant, my press assistant, my
                    administrative secretary, they were all involved as a team in our programs and I
                    think without them those programs would not have been done.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have another question. As a representative of the United
                        States government and as a diplomatic official who is supposed to carry out
                        the American policy of that period towards that country and in this case the
                        PRC, in both period when you were in Beijing and in Shenyang, did you
                        personally experience any kind of conflict? In order to implement your
                        official policy this is what you need to do, but in reality you really found
                        that is not a very smart idea to do it in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: That is a third element that I did not experience personally, but that
                    is an experience in the Foreign Service, and that is what happens if the
                    individual officer fundamentally disagrees with his own country's policy on a
                    particular issue, and I am thinking about having recently read about the
                    resignation of a couple of our Yugoslav policy officers who resigned on
                    principle because they disagreed with current American position in Yugoslavia.
                    And, of course, having served there I have an emotional attachment to the issues
                    and very much respect the decisions of the four promising young men, who made
                    their own decision to leave government service (even though it is a wonderful
                    career and maybe a unique career), because they could not agree with their own
                    government's policies. That may be rare, but that is a third element. At the
                    time I was in US government service I was not faced with a moral conflict
                    between what I personally believed and what the policy was of my government
                    towards a particular situation in the country I was serving in. So I was spared
                    that.</p>
                <p>Your question also points to a pragmatic issue of here's your mission but can you
                    really do it. I have to say again I was pretty fortunate: in Shenyang I think
                    given the overall political differences at the time between China and the US,
                    the programmatic expectation was that not much would be able to be accomplished
                    in that period. So I was not burdened with over expectation on the part of
                    superiors or our program people back in Washington. In fact, it was the
                    reverse.</p>
                <p>But, from what I have seen in my service experience, there is a fair amount of
                    latitude given to individual officers in the execution of their duties. I found
                    that especially in a small post like Shenyang...we had five Americans and
                    everybody else was family or Chinese nationals. And in the compound next door to
                    us were five Japanese diplomats. So it is a very entrepreneurial and very
                    collegial setting. Now in a large embassy obviously the division of labor is
                    much stricter and the hierarchy may be a little more severe. We in Shenyang were
                    almost like a new joint venture; we were out there at a frontier post! We were
                    given a lot of latitude. And that is helpful, because if you can do something
                    constructive you are one step ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also I think it has something to do with the United
                        States government's understanding of the post-Tiananmen Square situation in
                        China so they were not expecting the embassy people to do a lot.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I understand the people in Beijing, especially after Tiananmen
                    happened had a very difficult time starting the more programmatic aspects of our
                    work up again. I came after Tiananmen and it may be that it was harder to
                    operate in the capital than out in the provinces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Especially the Tiananmen incident had a strong effect on
                        Beijing and even in Shanghai you felt the difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I was Branch Public Affairs Officer in Shenyang, so head of section.
                    That sounds very grandiose, but I was the only American USIA officer in my
                    section. So I was head of myself and my Chinese staff. I reported to the Public
                    Affairs Officer who was the Minister-Counselor for Public Affairs in Beijing. He
                    was the senior USIA officer for all of us stationed in China and there were
                    quite a few of us since every consulate had USIA officers. I also reported to
                    the Consul General of my own consulate in Shenyang, who was kind of a mini
                    ambassador of that. Over all was the ambassador who was the supervisor of the
                    entire U.S. diplomatic mission in China, regardless of the agency you
                    represented. Then you also had your own agency bosses back in Washington. It
                    sounds like a lot of reporting and hierarchy, but there was also a considerable
                    amount of latitude.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I think I found that, interestingly enough, as I went further north, the looser
                    things were politically. Heilongjiang province, at the time, I found probably
                    the easiest in terms of initiating some new contact with some new program
                    activity. Jiein, as it is geographically, was kind of in the middle, and of
                    course we were based in Liaoning. I think the provincial government's foreign
                    affairs office looked more closely at us there then they would obviously when we
                    went off to Heilongjiang. But even in Liaoning, with the right relationships, in
                    programs that were not perceived to be too threatening to China, there was a lot
                    that was possible to initiate. But I noticed going up to Heilongjiang, which is
                    the Russian/Chinese border, that there was a kind of frontier independence. As
                    you know a hundred years ago it was the frontier. There was gold mining, there
                    were wild native tribes. The railroads helped open up that area just like it did
                    in the West. I think there are a lot of similarities between parts of Manchuria
                    and the American West. Underpopulated until recently, depending on mining
                    extraction, fur industry, developed by outside powers...in the States it was
                    easterners coming west and developing western mining industries, etc. and in
                    Manchuria it was Russians and Japanese coming in. But there is a frontier
                    mentality there of “we are our own bosses.” I found of all the provincial
                    interactions that the Heilongjiangers were kind of like the American Westerners
                    here in the U.S. Southwest. Beijing was important, but it was far away somewhere
                    else and the Heilongjiangers didn't have to look over their shoulder for every
                    permission. Whereas the Shenyang authorities were much more cautious and not
                    terribly open, very careful, very considering of every proposal and taking a
                    long time to coming around to certain decisions. Of course the provincial
                    government of Heilongjiang had to do the same thing but I think they were more
                    ready to say, “Our goal is making Heilongjiang a wealthy province and if that
                    means bringing in American business, fine; if that means sending our folks to
                    America for training and bringing some Americans in, fine; whatever it takes to
                    get us moving, that is what we want.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, China is a large country and we have a saying
                        that is carried down from centuries ago which says...The sky is high and far
                        away and the king is remote from me...and means that I can do whatever I
                        want. That in a way explains the rapid development in Canton, Guangzhou. I
                        have heard Cantonese people say that if we want to do something we still do
                        it whether it is after the Tiananmen incident or before that. See, it did
                        not have such an impact on them as it did especially on the intellectuals in
                        Beijing or on the general public of Beijing. So I think being stationed in
                        Shenyang would make a difference then if you had been stationed in
                        Beijing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Oh, I am sure. If you draw a spectrum and talk about north China, and
                    this is really speculation on my part, really not deep knowledge, you would have
                    Beijing on one end of the spectrum and Harbin or Heilongjiang on the other.
                    Liaoning, Shenyang would be closer in terms of caution and political supervision
                    to Beijing. One incident, for example, was that the president of the major
                    university in Liaoning, who was apparently a well known reformist
                    economist...again this is a secondhand story I heard in China...kept his
                    students out of trouble during Tiananmen Square, but he didn't prevent them from
                    going off, down to Beijing if that is what they chose to do. He is still
                    president, he maintained his presidency, but he was kind of under wraps for
                    foreigners. It took a year for him to be able to attend a US consulate function
                    after Tiananmen. Whereas, his staff like the vice president and department
                    heads, could under certain circumstances and did participate and respond to our
                    invitations to various academic and professional programming. But although the
                    president was invited each time (he normally would be the one to receive the new
                    Consul General and section chief, like me). was kind of under wraps for
                    foreigners. I remember the first time he was “out” was in the spring of 1991.
                    That was when he felt able to accept an invitation from the consulate to attend
                    a consulate function. So that was 1989-91, two years during which he had to
                    maintain a cautious position.</p>
                <p>Now, others did not. Usually the economic officials had the most latitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he was president of the university and we
                        understand the Tiananmen incident had most to do with universities, and if
                        he was in that capacity, whatever position he took would have a great impact
                        on him afterwards for a while. It was good to hear that finally he did
                        appear.</hi>

                <p>KURZBAUER: He appeared at a dinner that we hosted for the visit of the head of
                    USIA's East Asia Bureau. But there are many interesting vignettes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question. In China we use the term “peaceful
                        evolution,” that is the strategy of the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Well, that is what Chinese political commentators say is the strategy
                    of the United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the official Chinese line and they said to watch
                        out for the “peaceful occupation”...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: In a sense it implies that our real hidden agenda is intellectual
                    occupation by peaceful means.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, or intellectual invasion of China. Now, as a USIS
                        official, as you were laying out the objectives and everything, that if
                        something of that kind is behind all those, then you are the one who is
                        doing something which would contribute to that so-called strategy of the
                        United States diplomacy in China. Now what I am trying to get from you is,
                        how would you interpret the so-called “peaceful evolution” as a strategy in
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Are you using the term, “peaceful evolution” in the way that the
                    Chinese political commentators would use it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I am using it within quotations. I am saying you
                        worked for that section and generally you worked as a diplomatic
                        official...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Is somebody going to be thinking that my real purpose is undermining
                    the Chinese present system by the introduction of or the exposure to a variety
                    of American alternatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could you persuade Chinese officials in Beijing that
                        that is not what you are doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: This reminds me of a question when I was in Beijing in 1984-86 as
                    assistant press officer and I was asked to give a series of talks about American
                    culture and policy to the New China News Agency's English language group of
                    journalists. It was among the early times that foreign diplomats were allowed to
                    go to Xinhua headquarters. Probably now it happens all the time, but this was in
                    1985. I had a fabulous time. These were young journalists being trained under
                    the Thompson Foundation program. The British press magnate, Lord Thompson, had
                    given money to Xinhua to develop professional journalism standards and training.
                    So this was a special group of Xinhua journalists who were English speaking and
                    would be working in foreign posts.You know how it is in China, audience people
                    did not easily ask questions openly. A lecturer finished lecturing and that's
                    that. (I know in Europe in the old days my father told me he never would ask
                    questions in a German-Austrian high school or college.) The professor lectured
                    and the students took notes, you didn't raise your hand and challenge, etc. So I
                    think part of that in China comes from another sort of academic tradition and
                    part of it is also social and political caution. So I went to lecture and didn't
                    expect really very many questions. Instead, I got a whole wealth of questions.
                    One of the young journalists said, “Well, isn't it true that all diplomats are
                    spies?”!! So, they asked me about being a spy, so I had to answer them, but no
                    one ever asked me about “peace evolution” so I never had to answer it. But it
                    was obviously in the back of the minds of the people who were looking at the
                    programs we were doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>My answer would be that I am a representative of my country and my culture. This
                    is how my country and culture operate. We have had successes, we have had
                    failures. We have challenges, we have many problems that we have not overcome
                    and we are struggling with. And we have had things that we think work. I am here
                    to present the reality as best as any one small program can or any one section
                    can of the vast diversity that is the United States. Openness is a hallmark, so
                    we are open or try to be. Disagreement and critique is part of our cultural way
                    so we have to be this way. The adjustment in a China-aimed program has to be in
                    approach, but the fundamental values cannot be adjusted or otherwise we betray
                    who we are. At the same time we are here to look at China as best as we can and
                    understand it from a Chinese perspective. I am not here to tell you what to do.
                    I may believe that a certain way of doing something is the best, but I am not
                    presumptuous enough to tell you that you must do it that way. I can only present
                    that aspect to you and have you see if this is appropriate. There are some areas
                    where there are obvious benefits of working together in a collegial way. There
                    are environmental problems, narcotic transfer problems, AIDs problems, medical
                    problems that both of our countries face. We can bring together our best experts
                    and our best methods to solve these problems. And I think one can agree that
                    there obviously are political and social differences because you have 5,000
                    years of history and we have 200 plus. China is not really an ethnocentric
                    state, but I think in many ways you can say there still is a dominant Han
                    culture and at the same time a lot of diversity within that Han culture. But if
                    you want to over simplify, there is a core that over thousands of years Han
                    Chinese have seen themselves as related and united at least culturally if not
                    politically or geographically. We are very different. Our whole history is
                    serendipitous, diverse, and so naturally that history affects our values. So I
                    am here to be as best as I can be an honest representative of what I perceive or
                    what our programs help us to try to perceive about who we are. I am here also to
                    honestly listen to you and all of what you are. We have to be honest
                    representatives of who we are. And that is how I would answer it.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>If I am an American diplomat serving in Jordan where there is a constitutional
                    monarchy, I would be lying and betraying who I am and what I represent to say to
                    you to make you feel comfortable that monarchy is obviously the best political
                    system. Maybe it is appropriate for Jordan. But this is not what I represent, I
                    am presenting you with the alternatives that the American experience has
                    generated. No political official in China has ever asked me that directly. I
                    mean, they asked me the spy question and that was a journalist. I remember that
                    answer because I was so shocked for a moment I didn't know what to say.
                    Obviously I don't know much about spying but from what I read the purpose is
                    basically to gather information. I would say, “Well, you know an embassy gathers
                    information. How do we gather information? We gather it by talking to you. We
                    gather it by reading your newspapers. We gather it by reading your literature.
                    And your diplomats and your journalists are doing the same thing in the United
                    States. Now is that bad? I don't think it is bad because if we don't read your
                    literature and your newspapers our perceptions of you are stereotypical, just as
                    mine were of China...everybody running around China dressed in green and blue.
                    Even as an educated woman and as an American official, before I went to China I
                    knew I had a stereotype, but it was there unconsciously inside of me. 'China is
                    grim, the Chinese are regimented, the Chinese don't think for themselves.' All
                    kinds of things. If I hadn't been to China, if I hadn't seen, if I hadn't
                    gathered information that stereotype would prevail. So I think the information
                    aspect comes through reading, talking, programs and interactions and I think it
                    is very important for both countries.” And that is the answer I would give.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is wonderful. I purposely asked this question in
                        order to provide some material for a future researcher because I think there
                        ought to be somebody who gets into that to do research to explain what
                        “peaceful evolution” is in terms of relations between countries, what ought
                        to be and why this is perceived as “peaceful evolution.” I mean, I just felt
                        like it needs to be answered because it is very one sided and the Chinese
                        government says it and tells people that way what do you mean by that..</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>KURZBAUER: That's interesting too because I think there is a perception among...I
                    am not really a deep expert in broad policy formulation, as an officer I have
                    been much more the implementer than the policy designer. That is both my
                    background and functional assignments and probably what I do better. I think I
                    am probably a better facilitator than I would be a staffer at the National
                    Security Council creating the right policy we hope for the right moment. But
                    still the general thinking is, I would think, that obviously relationships with
                    nations, states or countries, that have similar perceptions and values are
                    easier. Obviously we relate to Great Britain in an easy way although we have our
                    differences and problems as well. We have them with France, as you just saw in
                    the GATT negotiations and agricultural subsidies. Every nation is going to look
                    out for its own self-interest, and that is the way it should be, even if they
                    are closely related by history or political system. But overall the
                    relationships tend to be easier with those whose systems are similar. So there
                    is a presumption that in the best of all possible worlds, most nation's
                    political and social systems will be organized somewhat akin to ours. But you
                    know, the US society is changing and evolving. Our social criteria change. Our
                    social problems are changing. Our issues are changing. So no society is ever in
                    this ideal state. And there is no such thing as the ideal republic or the ideal
                    democracy. We kind of strive towards it but it is going to take a different
                    form. Even the British democracy's working out of social practice or political
                    relationships are not like ours entirely. I think there are some basic
                    assumptions that are similar and we might want to consider as universal. But the
                    working out of those universals and those values differs even among politically
                    akin nations. And in the end, I am sure scholars are going to say, it will have
                    to be China that decides somehow for itself, and it is a very difficult process.
                    America has been evolving for 200 years. We were not born as we are now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Personally as a student of diplomacy and diplomatic
                        relations, my deep belief is that we ought to do everything as a person to
                        promote understanding between and among countries. The more we understand
                        each other the less we will fight against each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: I would want to believe that also. Some people say that it is like
                    personal relations, if you know too much about somebody, you wind up hating
                    them. But I am still an optimistic and have that same personal belief as you
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is based on the recent history. If you look at
                        the kind of things that the United States foreign policy was based on or the
                        Chinese foreign policy, or the Soviet foreign policy, was based on during
                        the Cold War years. Now in retrospect we have a great number of books that
                        we can read which tell us that there were a lot of misconceptions,
                        especially between China and the United States. There were literally no
                        contacts at all and so each of them were trying to understand the other by
                        their own bias or prejudice and that created a lot of problems. So from the
                        recent history I feel that the more we understand each other...</hi>

                <p>KURZBAUER: I am taking a course over in the political science department now in
                    administrative theory. We have been assigned to read a book called “Group
                    Think,” which you may have heard of. It is by a social psychiatrist at Yale. He
                    analyzes foreign policy decision making in certain key episodes. One of them was
                    the decision to cross the 38th parallel during the Korean War. He goes into the
                    long discussion bringing in the historical and diplomatic and scholarly
                    literature on U.S. misperceptions not only of the Chinese resolve, but of China
                    itself. We did not see China as a proud new revolutionary state with its own
                    perception of its own self-interests. It sounds like from just reading secondary
                    sources in this “Group Think” book that our policy makers saw China through a
                    very stereotypical lens and that was as a tool of the Soviet Union. That is just
                    a small anecdotal example, but it points right to your point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to add to it quickly, what happened in Vietnam. It
                        turned out that the perception was that Vietnam was operated from Beijing
                        and Moscow, but we now know it is not all that true.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right and that is how the United States jumped
                        right into it. That is the period that I concentrate on in my studies and
                        that is how I come to this sort of conclusion that the more we understand
                        the less we will fight against each other. I think to promote understanding
                        between countries is everybody's task.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: You know it is strange because you look at that and you see how our
                    two nations have had a history of close alliance, the World War II history, and
                    positive mutual perceptions. And then a great divide of mutual hostility and
                    mutual misperceptions and so forth. But we can approach that and can find
                    congruence at least on many levels.</p>
                <p>And then there is Yugoslavia and I am still trying to figure it out, even having
                    worked and lived there for two years and probably having gotten more deeply into
                    ordinary society than I did in China, to be honest. Trying to understand how
                    people who are fighting each other stem from the same nation, if you will, the
                    Slavic nation. They speak basically the same languages: Croatian and Serbian
                    linguistic differences are minute. It is analogous to British and American
                    English. The people are Slavic by original ancestry but history for a variety of
                    reasons has divided them into the Catholic, Orthodox Christian, and Muslim
                    segments. Empires from the outside came in and changed histories. People found
                    themselves on different sides of imperial lines, the Ottoman and Austrian. It is
                    like saying the Shandong and the Hebei people who both stem, at least according
                    to legend, from the Great Yellow Emperor, are now fighting each other to the
                    death. And yet not only are the Slavs originally from the same stock way back,
                    they have had the experience of living, working and intermarrying with each
                    other in many cases for at least the last fifty years. And yet that nationhood
                    was not able to sustain itself.</p>

                <p>So you have the optimist and pessimist. On one hand you have two nations like the
                    US and China who are so diverse and have both a bitter and a sweet history, who
                    are somehow making more and more approaches towards each other. And you have
                    peoples who are interrelated but are separating. I will leave it to the
                    historians and the academics to answer that questions. But we belong on the
                    hopeful side, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's hope so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Thank you very much for your time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you, I enjoyed it. I have known you a lot but we
                        have never had such a concentrated conversation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Maybe we can talk more at another time professionally or personally. I
                    read about the Oral History Project in the Foreign Service Journal and wrote a
                    letter to the gentleman in charge of it and they explained about the volunteer
                    project and hopefully I will be able to do some. You might be interested or
                    willing, if you have time to come with me when I interview Ambassador Huntsman
                    who was in Singapore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That should be interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: It should be interesting because as you know he has a very strong
                    affiliation, interest and knowledge of China, both as a public servant and a
                    major business figure. And he speaks Mandarin and some Cantonese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would love to if the schedule fits.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: It will be some time this winter. Anyway, this experience helps me to
                    reflect back because now I am not in it. While you are doing it you don't have
                    much time for reflection. Sometimes, late night, you get together with your
                    Foreign Service colleagues and friends at the embassy or after a cocktail party
                    or in somebody's apartment and you start talking, but most of the day is
                    involved in the day to day, what's the policy, what's the immediate crisis,
                    what's the program, and you don't have time to sit back and reflect. It is
                    really nice for me to have someone who understands the process and the country
                    and it helped me focus back on these reflections.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I certainly have my own tendencies, I was asking
                        questions mostly about China. But I am glad you brought in your Yugoslavian
                        experience in several places, which hopefully will make this recording
                        useful to someone who is interested in Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER:Well there were similarities and differences. In fact China and
                    Yugoslavia have very positive relations at the time when I was there. even
                    though the way they unfolded under the communist-socialist system was quite
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After China split from the Soviet Union and India in the
                        early sixties, they too got....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KURZBAUER: Well, it was a natural because Yugoslavia was a maverick state. What I
                    found so interesting...when I was assigned to Yugoslavia I didn't know much
                    about it but thanks to Foreign Service training I at least got an
                    introduction... what I didn't realize was that when Yugoslavia left the
                    Cominform, it was not because there had been a policy or sovereignty reason to
                    separate, but because Stalin threw them out. Tito, at that time, was a devoted
                    Stalinist communist and he organized Yugoslavia after the war on democratic
                    centralist lines with everything coming from the top. Yugoslavia ended up
                    through the decades as a federated system. But it was not initially because
                    policy makers in Yugoslavia thought this through, it was because Stalin
                    perceived Tito to be a threat, he was too independent, too nationalistic, even
                    though Tito perceived himself as a loyal communist. So all of a sudden
                    Yugoslavia was left hanging. It was like your father throws you out of the house
                    and what do you do now? So they had to reinvent themselves in some other way, to
                    define themselves in such a way so they could say that they were the true
                    communists and it was Stalin and his system that were the aberrations.</p>
                <p>China too had its thorny relationship, so I think it was a natural alliance. Two
                    countries that in one way or another had been threatened by the Soviet Union.
                    There were a lot of Chinese students and diplomats in Belgrade when I was there.
                    That was, I guess, my first introduction to official China, the meeting of these
                    Chinese students and diplomats at various functions.</p>
