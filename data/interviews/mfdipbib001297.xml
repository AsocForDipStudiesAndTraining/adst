                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Wyman, we're going to be concentrating this interview
                        on your time in Ethiopia. What was the period you were in Ethiopia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: That was from 1972 to 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which were rather crucial years in the history of
                        Ethiopia. Before that, I wonder if you could give just a short summary of
                        your background: how you came into the Foreign Service, and the type of
                        posts that you'd had until you were assigned to Ethiopia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, I came into the Foreign Service in 1946, directly from military
                    service during the war. I had two days in-between. I took my discharge in
                    Berlin, and went into the Foreign Service right there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of military service did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, I was in the field artillery, and got into the fighting at the very
                    end, in the Battle of the Ruhr. I'd started out in the Air Force, but wound up
                    in the artillery.</p>
                <p>I had always wanted to come into the Foreign Service, ever since I was in high
                    school, and had it in mind all the way through. And when I was still in the Army
                    in the summer of '45, and saw the announcement about the Foreign Service
                    examinations, I hurried to take the opportunity right then to put in my
                    application.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what type of assignments had you had, prior to going
                        to Ethiopia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, it was a mixture, really, of mostly political assignments, and
                    economic assignments—quite a few. All together I'd spent ten years in Germany:
                    twice in Berlin, once in D�sseldorf. I'd had some experience in Berlin, on the
                    second tour, towards the end of it, in a position that was called Political
                    Advisor but actually was the counterpart of a DCM position.</p>
                <p>Then I'd been to the University of North Dakota, as a Diplomat in Residence for a
                    year. I was over, briefly, in the Pentagon as a State Department advisor in the
                    Office of Policy and Planning, for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Then I went out to
                    Vietnam and was Province Senior Advisor there in Tay Ninh, from 1970 to 1972.
                    And that was my last assignment prior to going over to Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in your background, you really had quite a bit of
                        experience with the American military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes our most difficult diplomatic assignment is the
                        difference between the State Department and the Department of Defense.
                        (Laughs) Well, how did you get your assignment to Ethiopia? Do you know? Was
                        it a routine one, or had you sought it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, no, I hadn't particularly sought it. When I came back from Vietnam,
                    I had indicated I was very much interested in a DCM position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might—just for the record—say DCM means Deputy Chief of
                        Mission, which is the number two person in the embassy; it's deputy to the
                        ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: I had simply indicated that was the kind of position I was most interested
                    in, and I did not particularly seek out Ethiopia. But that came to me—the
                    proposal that I go there—and I was very pleased with it. I thought it would be
                    an extremely interesting job, and it proved to be even more so than I had
                    thought. (Laughs) Of course, I do remember thinking that with Vietnam having
                    been my last post, I was going to a place that would be very quiet and peaceful,
                    in comparison to what I had just come from. And I turned out to be wrong about
                    that, of course. (Laughs) It was anything but!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, who was the ambassador at the time you were
                        assigned there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Ross Adair was the ambassador when I came. He was a former congressman
                    from Indiana, and had been congressman for—oh, quite a long time. And then he
                    was defeated in an election, and very shortly after that was appointed the
                    ambassador to Ethiopia.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was there for part of the time you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, he had already been there for—oh, I think about a year and a half
                    before I arrived. And then I had, basically, a year and a half while he was
                    still there. Then, for health reasons, he resigned and left. And it was, I
                    believe, four days after he left that the very first event of the Ethiopian
                    Revolution took place; one that we were not immediately aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now just to give a full picture of this, how did
                        Ambassador Adair use you as his deputy? There's always a difference in the
                        way ambassadors use their deputies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, he relied on me very much, and on the whole staff. He was very
                    conscious of the fact that his experience was, in most respects, very different
                    from that of a Foreign Service Officer. And he felt it was entirely appropriate,
                    and wanted, to rely heavily on all of this staff. And I must say, from that
                    standpoint, I was delighted with the whole arrangement. He sought our advice. He
                    took it very seriously, and expected us to make recommendations to him, and paid
                    great attention to our recommendations. I would like to see all non-career
                    ambassadors follow the kind of pattern that he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me, where do you see his strengths? I mean, if
                        he was relying on you, what was his input into the operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, he was—of course, as a former congressman, tremendously skilled in
                    dealing with people. He had a great deal of contact, and many cordial
                    relationships with the people in power in Ethiopia at that time, and with the
                    diplomatic community; and certainly, I think, did a good bit to promote respect
                    for the United States, in that way. I think he felt that his principal
                    contribution could be more along those lines, than it would be, say, in
                    initiating new policies, and changes in policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to the events in Ethiopia, just a little
                        background. How did you find the staff? I mean, you had not come with any
                        experience in Africa. You were a skilled political officer. You had come
                        from a turbulent place, where you had to use all your skills in Vietnam. But
                        still, you didn't know the Horn of Africa. How did you find the embassy
                        staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: I felt they were very competent. There were very few, really, that had had
                    experience in Africa. I remember one or two. I hadn't had experience in Africa,
                    although I had served in Cairo many years previously; and that had given me at
                    least some greater awareness of that part of the world than I would have had
                    otherwise.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>But I did find that our people—when they arrived—invariably became quite
                    interested in the history of Ethiopia, and dug into it, and learned something
                    about the background. Part of the reason for that, I think, was that, when you
                    get into it, Ethiopian history is quite fascinating.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of countries in Africa where there isn't a great deal on the
                    record, farther back, as to what was going on. Well, that isn't the case in
                    Ethiopia; there's a lot known about Ethiopian history, going right back to B.C.
                    And it's been a very turbulent and dramatic history. The country is dramatic
                    itself, physically. We usually found that our people would get very much
                    interested in Ethiopia, and wanted to know more about it, as soon as they
                    arrived. And that helped.</p>
                <p>Our Political Counselor was a person who had arrived at the same time I did—Peter
                    Sebastian. And he, particularly, did this kind of thing, and acquired an
                    excellent background—I felt—in Ethiopian history, and particularly the current
                    history, very rapidly. He was a tremendous source of strength all the way
                    through the whole period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When in the year did you arrive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: In the summer of '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Ethiopia at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, our primary interest, actually, was Kagnew Station, located in
                    Asmara. That was a communications station for the Navy. It was a very special,
                    high-powered communications station which had a very important role in our
                    overall communications network around the world. There wasn't anything quite
                    like it anywhere near there. It was regarded as being of great importance, from
                    the military standpoint.</p>
                <p>So we, of course, operated that station with the consent of the Ethiopian
                    government. And we had had it for many years before, and were very anxious to
                    keep it. We, on our part, were important—well, I'm going beyond your
                    question—but we were very important to the Ethiopians, from the standpoint of
                    both economic assistance, and military assistance. And those, too, were programs
                    that went back a long way. We had provided them—as we had, of course, many other
                    countries—with a lot of economic assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But also—and this was different, certainly, from the situation elsewhere in
                    Africa—we had been giving them a lot of military training, and had many military
                    advisors on the spot—I mean, in country—to help with the training. And also, we
                    had provided military equipment. Most of it was on terms of grant assistance,
                    where the Ethiopians did not have to repay for the acquisition of this
                    equipment. And so, in both terms of training and equipment, the Ethiopian
                    military was very heavily dependent upon the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Expanding this a bit, from your point of view—we had this
                        army dependent on us, but a fairly well equipped military force, and yet
                        most of it at that point was poised against Somalia. Somalia was another
                        country with whom we wanted to maintain good relations, and the balance
                        between these two was always a major problem. How did you feel about the
                        Somalia part of the equation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, the key factor there was that although we desired good relations
                    with Somalia, the Soviet Union had come in some years before I arrived, and
                    really become the primary patron, the primary backer, the primary helper of
                    Somalia; in a fashion which, in some respects, resembled our position in
                    relation to Ethiopia. However, they had provided practically nothing in terms of
                    economic assistance, but their emphasis on military assistance was very heavy.
                    And they had actually—on an annual basis—provided much more military assistance
                    for Somalia than we had for Ethiopia—much more.</p>
                <p>The result was that Somalia was yearly becoming a greater threat to Ethiopia,
                    because Somalia had always claimed—ever since it became independent—that it was
                    entitled to a very large slice of Ethiopia, known as the Ogaden. They made it
                    clear that they expected one day to get it back, by one means or another. Since
                    the Ethiopian government showed no disposition to give them an inch of it, there
                    was a distinct military threat there that everybody was aware of. And the threat
                    was growing, as I say, every year. So that was the picture between Ethiopia and
                    Somalia. That played a very important role in all those events that were to
                    follow, during the Revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could now describe the situation in
                        Ethiopia when you arrived? Remember, we're trying to have you say how you
                        saw it, and how we were looking at the situation at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: The Ethiopian situation as it looked when I arrived. Yes, and I'll make
                    that distinction, and emphasize that I'll speak of it now, as it looked when I
                    arrived, because of course, looking back later with hindsight, you would tend to
                    emphasize things a little bit differently.</p>
                <p>As I arrived, the Emperor, of course, had been really the government.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Haile Selassie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Haile Selassie had been the government since he took power in 1930—some 42
                    years before the time that I arrived there. He had introduced quite a few
                    liberal reforms when he was a young man, particularly in the 1930s. Things such
                    as abolishing slavery, introducing a constitution, a cabinet, a parliament. And
                    rather amazingly, these were things—as far as I can tell from reading the
                    history—practically nobody in Ethiopia had suggested. He came out with them
                    himself; he absolutely led the way as a reformer in those early years.</p>
                <p>As time went by, though, he definitely became more conservative. Despite the
                    existence of a parliament and a cabinet, it was largely a system of one-man
                    rule. He made all the basic decisions. And he became more conservative. He put a
                    lot of emphasis on education; that was one of the things, certainly, that he
                    deserves the most credit for. In that respect, he did something that I think is
                    absolutely unprecedented: while Emperor, he took the title of Minister of
                    Education. I don't know of any emperor that ever did anything like that. And he
                    did it strictly to emphasize how important he thought education was for his
                    people.</p>
                <p>But, as I say, as he got older he tended to become more and more conservative,
                    and you began to get—particularly from the people that had been thoroughly
                    educated—more and more of a desire to break out of an old fashioned system of
                    government, into something a bit more modern. And finally, in 1960, there was a
                    coup that took place, while the Emperor was out of the country. That was a very
                    clear signal that dissatisfaction was building up.</p>
                <p>But the Emperor came back very hastily, by airplane, and soon after his arrival,
                    he got control of the coup. The situation quieted down entirely and it remained
                    quiet in the years following. So in that period, from 1960 to '72, when I
                    arrived, things had gone on quietly and smoothly, for the most part. And it was
                    certainly the conventional wisdom when I arrived that the situation would remain
                    basically unchanged until the Emperor died.</p>
                <p>To say it was the conventional wisdom is to understate the case. It was a
                    unanimous opinion. The reason we would ask about that kind of thing so much was
                    that so many of us were new, and we could see that the system was quite
                    different from what you had operating elsewhere, even in Africa. So we would ask
                    about the stability of it, and the prospects for the future. And we always got
                    the same answer. I can't remember anybody who was a maverick on this point. All
                    bets were off when the Emperor died. But as long as he was alive, obviously
                    things were going to go along pretty much as they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is an interesting point. Sometimes when you
                        have people coming in from the outside—as often happens in the Foreign
                        Service—they have not absorbed the local cultures. So sometimes they can
                        look at things with a clearer and colder eye. But if you get the
                        conventional answer, you get trapped into that mind set.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, that's right. And if you looked for real symptoms of trouble—while,
                    of course, it was obvious you had an antiquated type of government—you had an
                    economic situation that was very poor. There were very, very few countries—maybe
                    a handful in the whole world—that appeared to have an average standard of living
                    lower than in Ethiopia. In that sense, everybody knew there was potential for
                    trouble there. But the only symptom of anything breaking out had been way back
                    in 1960, and, as I say, that had really disappeared almost immediately once the
                    Emperor reappeared, and things had been quiet since then.</p>
                <p>So people were speculating quite a bit as to what might happen after the Emperor
                    died. There was no agreement on that. There were all kinds of different
                    possibilities. But it looked as though you would have stability until the
                    Emperor died. That was really the major thing that one could say about the way
                    Ethiopia looked, at the time I arrived. That, and the fact that, in economic
                    terms, it was a disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now just one further question on the situation then.
                        We had an AID program at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well was that done, with the problems of distribution,
                        corruption, and all that? And how did we cope with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, I think that we did quite well with our AID program. I do not
                    believe that we had too much problem with corruption there. I don't think we
                    were losing a lot of the value of the aid for that reason. It was a pretty
                    modest program of economic assistance; modest in terms of what needed to be done
                    and modest if you compare it with our AID programs elsewhere. If you compare it
                    with the amount of Ethiopian government spending on improving the economy, it
                    was not modest; it was very impressive in those terms. But still, in dollars and
                    cents it was not a large amount. And given the vast amount of development that
                    Ethiopia needed, one definitely should not have, and could not have, expected
                    any miracles from it.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I do remember one other factor that we had to struggle with there, and that was
                    that we felt, really, that the building of roads was particularly important in
                    Ethiopia. They had incredible figures: something like—the vast majority of the
                    people lived more than a full day's walk from the nearest road. So we felt that
                    building roads was very important to any kind of development. Well, at that
                    particular time, at least, our Congress was very much prejudiced against
                    spending AID money on roads, and we had to battle with that all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With this in mind, how would you characterize Ethiopian
                        society, as you saw it? Speaking particularly about the bureaucracy, the
                        military, the merchant class, and other groups—as we saw it. Were there
                        tensions between these classes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: No, I wouldn't say you had unusual tensions there. The society was
                    normally characterized as feudal, and I think that is a pretty good term for it.
                    There were members of the royal family, and governors of different parts of the
                    country, who exercised a lot of authority in their own geographic areas. They
                    were subject to, and definitely took orders from the Emperor, but nevertheless,
                    they had a great deal of authority in their particular parts of the country. And
                    that, of course, was very feudal in nature.</p>
                <p>There was a definite assigned sphere for the military, and the types of things
                    they could do; and for the bureaucracy. The different components of society were
                    operating within clear limits, I would say, established by the Emperor. So to
                    use the term feudal society was probably the correct one.</p>
                <p>I don't think there was so much tension between the different classes of the
                    society. However, there always—in Ethiopia—had been a fair amount of geographic
                    tension, between different parts of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was really an empire in the true sense, wasn't it? You
                        had Tigre, you had Eritrea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had different tribal groups, too, who were . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WYMAN: That's right, and some areas had become part of Ethiopia much more
                    recently than others. In the mid-nineteenth century, for example, great chunks
                    in the south had been added. And the feeling of national unity was weak, despite
                    the fact that Ethiopia went back centuries and centuries and centuries. So there
                    always had been a lot of tension there. And of course those regional differences
                    were also rooted in differences in languages. So there was a good bit of tension
                    of that kind, but that had always been true in Ethiopian history, and was not
                    anything new. It wasn't perceived that there was any particular danger of that
                    pulling the society apart.</p>
                <p>Now, Eritrea was a special case, and there's too much of a history there, really,
                    for me to get into. But beginning in 1962, there had really been an organized
                    resistance in Eritrea, and they were trying to acquire independence from
                    Ethiopia. That resistance had, more or less, grown year after year. By the time
                    that I got there in 1972, it was a well-developed, internal resistance movement.
                    And fighting would occasionally take place in different parts of Eritrea. But
                    this was on a very, very small scale compared to what came later. And certainly
                    one made a visit—as we Americans did—to Asmara and Massawa without any feeling
                    that you were really getting into a dangerous area, or anything like that. Other
                    parts of Eritrea—more remote parts—were somewhat dangerous, but not there in the
                    big cities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now I think having sort of set the background of how
                        we saw it, can you talk about how events unrolled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, one suddenly began to hear, early in 1974—and I believe it was the
                    latter part of January—one began to hear of a strike by the taxicab drivers in
                    Addis, and a bit later a strike by certain teachers, and a bit later of a local
                    military mutiny against the commanders in one particular spot. And all of these
                    things involved demands being made by the lower-ranking people in the situation,
                    for certain concessions. These were not demands about changing the form of
                    government, or deposing the Emperor, or anything like that; they were very
                    localized demands.</p>
                <p>Now, it's difficult for me to remember the exact sequence at this time—and I
                    wouldn't really want to spell it out, anyway—of which event preceded which.
                    Eventually, we found out what the first event was. We didn't know at the time,
                    but later on we did find out the event that I think unquestionably was the start
                    of the Ethiopian Revolution. And of course it was of particular interest to find
                    that out, because after all, when you have something as momentous as a
                    revolution that turns a country upside down—its whole power structure—it's
                    particularly intriguing to know what really set it off—what was the start.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Well, what happened was that in some distant military outpost, in the Ogaden—the
                    semi-desert area, in the southwest of Ethiopia, where there were a good many
                    military outposts because of the fear of a Somalian invasion—there was a severe
                    shortage of water The well was not producing as much water as normal—the well
                    that everybody relied on for water. The officers insisted on taking a large
                    proportion of the available water for themselves, and apparently leaving little
                    water for the enlisted men, and certainly considerably less water than they
                    thought they should have.</p>
                <p>Well, they finally mutinied in that situation and they captured the commander of
                    this local outpost, which was quite small, and I think a couple of other
                    officers. They really just held all the officers—just tied them up—and insisted
                    that this situation had to change; they had to get enough water, and I think
                    they demanded one or two other reforms, too. But the basic one was water. The
                    officers agreed and were untied. Nobody was hurt in the incident at all. One
                    might well have thought that that would certainly be the end of it, and I think
                    it would have been except for one rather odd little feature of it.</p>
                <p>And that was that the enlisted men apparently decided that there might be some
                    retaliation against them eventually for having done this, even though they'd won
                    the demands; and that they might be safer off if they would let other enlisted
                    men in the army know what had happened, and give them the straight version of
                    the story—that this might protect them from retaliation. And so, over the
                    military network that connects all the military units in Ethiopia they put out
                    the word of what they had done.</p>
                <p>Well, this was absolutely like the proverbial situation where you have a tiny
                    snowball at the top of the mountain that starts down and picks up snow as it
                    goes. Because it was only a very few days after that that there was some
                    somewhat larger scale mutiny—but still at a low level—at another spot in
                    Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>Then the word of this got out beyond the military. The taxicab drivers had been
                    dissatisfied anyway. They noticed that the enlisted men who had pulled off this
                    mutiny had not been punished, and had achieved their demands. This gave them a
                    little incentive. They went on strike, and as I mentioned, the teachers did
                    later on. This was not all simultaneous; there were gaps in here of three, four,
                    five days—a week to ten days. But an amazing series of events like this began to
                    develop.</p>
                <p>And after they had gone on for, I'd say, approximately a month, they were
                    growing, obviously, in importance. And the labor unions got into the picture
                    later on, with a strike of their own. As these things became more serious, of
                    course, there was more and more publicity, and more and more people heard about
                    them, and decided this was their opportunity to improve their lot. And so the
                    Prime Minister resigned after about a month of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Well, then the Emperor chose a new Prime Minister. But about this time the
                    movement had gone far enough so that the different military units selected one
                    representative from each one, to go to Addis Ababa and get together to present
                    their grievances to the new Prime Minister. And that group that met in Addis was
                    called the Derg, which is a committee . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell Derg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Derg. And that became, eventually, the controlling factor in the whole
                    revolution. But it started out as just being these representatives that were
                    sent by their units to present grievances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these enlisted men, mostly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Usually they were non-commissioned officers or low-ranking officers. I
                    think the highest rank you would have found in there was major, but even that
                    was unusual. A lot of them were non-commissioned officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were our military advisors reporting on the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Oh yes, they started reporting on it in the very early stages. As I say,
                    that first event we were not aware of at the time, but we started reporting
                    regularly on each one of these things as it came along. At quite an early
                    stage—I can't remember just when, though—we began referring to it—I'm not sure
                    whether we did it so much in the telegrams, but certainly around town—the phrase
                    that was often used for this situation was “the creeping coup.”</p>
                <p>Because, you see, there had been a lot of military coups in Africa, and everybody
                    was very conscious of that. The typical coup, though, was something that would
                    happen absolutely overnight; the situation changed from one day to the next,
                    with a totally new group in control. But here—as I've tried to describe it a
                    bit, with this snowball simile—things were happening one additional event after
                    another, a few days apart, and this coup was developing more slowly. In the
                    first stages one thought of that word “coup”, because it was so commonplace in
                    Africa, and not at all—at the beginning—of the word “revolution”, because that
                    would mean something quite different. And there hadn't been revolutions in
                    Africa recently, and so we were thinking of it in terms of a creeping coup.</p>
                <p>But it was quite apparent, quite early in the situation—well, certainly with the
                    fall of the Prime Minister—that it was a very serious proposition, and nobody
                    was quite sure where it was going to go.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, as this goes on—this is an unclassified
                        interview—but was the CIA helpful, or were they probably keeping no more
                        abreast of it than you were getting from the regular sources?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, I'm pausing not really to be cautious. There's no particular need
                    for that, because I think I'll speak only in general terms. But I was really
                    trying to recall. There obviously was some information available from the CIA
                    that was not available elsewhere. If I remember correctly, I don't believe it
                    added much to our understanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's not the sort of thing—this would be a very hard
                        thing for it to get a handle on anyway; things sort of
                        disorganized—lower-echelon ranks, anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: You're absolutely right, and that gets back to a point that I'd want to
                    make anyway. There was certainly no controlling group at the outset. There was
                    no Lenin here who was organizing things, and making decisions as to today we'll
                    do this, and tomorrow we'll do that, and so forth—and bringing all this about
                    deliberately. It was certainly totally haphazard, uncoordinated, at the
                    beginning. Now, eventually, when the Derg came into existence—well, from then on
                    there began to be some centralized planning, and that did make a difference. But
                    not prior to that. And as you say, under those circumstances it's hard to
                    imagine what the CIA could have found out that really would have been of great
                    help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then how did this progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Let me back up, by the way, because I've left one factor out that I want
                    to put in here, and it's one that should be mentioned. One of the factors that
                    preceded the revolution, the year before, had been the terrible drought in
                    Ethiopia. I didn't mention it because the questions that you happened to put
                    didn't point, really, in that direction. But it was an important factor.</p>
                <p>In 1973 there had been a terrible drought in Tigre, and other central parts of
                    Ethiopia—north of Addis Ababa. Tremendous suffering resulted from that and many
                    people died as a result of it. It was a very flagrant example of the inability
                    of the Ethiopian government to cope with a really difficult situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>It's very clear that the government at that time was extremely anxious not to
                    give the impression that there was a drought crisis here, with which it could
                    not cope adequately. It did not want to have any publicity about that drought,
                    and the famine that was resulting from it. And this was a very important reason
                    why the efforts of outside countries to come in and assist Ethiopia, in coping
                    with the drought, came much later and slower than they would have otherwise. If
                    the Ethiopian government had come with urgent requests, at an early
                    date—anything like an early date—to foreign governments, the results would have
                    been considerably better than they were.</p>
                <p>I can remember, very well, that when we would—at the early stages of the
                    drought—when we would go to the government officials and ask them about this,
                    and ask them about their needs—well, it would be oversimplifying the case
                    somewhat—but generally their attitude was, “Well, this is not really as serious
                    as you might think. The accounts of it that you heard have been exaggerated. We
                    really don't think it's cause for that much concern. Yes, modest assistance from
                    you people would be welcomed, but let's not make the mistake of making a great
                    story of this. It's just not that serious.” That was their general attitude.</p>
                <p>And it had an effect on what we did. I've always felt very badly that we didn't
                    get into a major effort to help Ethiopia, because of that drought, until later
                    than we should have. But I think none of us could really believe, at the
                    beginning, that the situation was as bad as it was, when we met with this
                    attitude on the part of the Ethiopian government. So that was very sad.</p>
                <p>Now, sometimes the question is raised of how much that drought had to do with the
                    revolution that got started the following year. I think it certainly had
                    something to do with it, because it strengthened the impression among the
                    educated people of the country, who really were conscious of what was going on,
                    that the government had not shown the compassion toward its own people which it
                    should have, or made a concerted effort to do something about the situation. So
                    it damaged the government's reputation to a certain extent. But on the other
                    hand, I think that factor could be overdone, too. It would be a gross
                    oversimplification to say that the revolution got started because of the
                    terrible drought; it was one of the factors involved, but I don't think it was a
                    crucial factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now during this time of this creeping coup, you were
                        the Charg�; is this correct? The ambassador had left, so that you were in
                        charge of the American mission there. Were you seeing Haile Selassie, and
                        how did you find him at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: I saw him probably twice at the palace, to discuss things with him. I had
                    not seen him—well, that close up, you might say—before, and I was really shocked
                    by his mental feebleness, when I did see him. I had the definite impression,
                    frankly, that he was senile. He did not react with the degree of alertness that
                    I would have expected, really, from any head of state.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>On one of those occasions, I told him that the United States was planning to
                    leave Kagnew Station eventually and was cutting down the number of its military
                    personnel there substantially in the near future, which was an important
                    development from Ethiopia's standpoint. It was clear, from his reaction, that he
                    didn't like the idea, but he virtually had nothing to say on the subject. I
                    found that astonishing.</p>
                <p>Certainly this was a very important factor that enabled this incipient revolution
                    to get out of control. If he had been in full possession of his faculties, or if
                    he, at that time, had had somebody as Prime Minister to whom he gave full
                    support, and had acted very vigorously, the outcome might have been different, I
                    think. But that wasn't the case. So his condition had a lot to do with the
                    development of the revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then I suppose you might proceed with how things
                        moved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, once this Derg that I referred to came together in Addis, they began
                    to exert influence more and more on the situation. As a matter of fact, all
                    other authorities seemed to have lost their authority, to put it most simply.
                    You had what was increasingly seen to be a power vacuum, and it looked as though
                    the only people who could get some things done—you became increasingly aware—was
                    this Derg. Their influence was growing and expanding into this power vacuum,
                    where nobody else was really able to control matters.</p>
                <p>That situation went on, basically—I don't think there's too much point in going
                    into the details—went on, basically, until the Emperor was—in August of that
                    year, roughly six months after the revolution started—was really thrown out of
                    his palace and taken off to house arrest. The violent phase of the revolution,
                    though, had still not been reached at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how were we reading the Derg? Obviously, this was
                        taking place slowly, and you were watching the Emperor fade from sight. What
                        were our concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, we of course were very anxious to preserve the special relationship
                    that we had had with Ethiopia, really going back to the time prior to World War
                    II, when we had refused to recognize the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. That was
                    the first thing in our history of relations with Ethiopia that really
                    established us in a very special position. We had had that special position ever
                    since, with these special military assistance programs and economic assistance
                    programs, and we wanted to keep that relationship up.</p>
                <p>It wasn't entirely clear, I would say, what tangible advantages we were going to
                    derive, for our own strictly national interests, from that special relationship,
                    now that Kagnew Station was obviously diminishing in its importance.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because of technological progress—satellites, and
                        that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Exactly. That's the whole story. So, as I say, it wasn't clear exactly
                    what tangible benefits we were going to derive from it, but still it was a
                    relationship we were proud of, and we felt very strongly it was something we
                    wanted to keep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I ask a question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often it arises that American policy is driven by
                        economic—particularly commercial— interests. Did we have any particular
                        feeling that “Gee, there are markets here.”? I mean, was this an imperative
                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: In a word, no. (Laughs) I think that's easy to answer. I think of two
                    economic interests we had there at that time, but they were not going to be
                    imperilled, really—whatever happened, I would say. One, we bought a lot of
                    coffee from Ethiopia, and that was going to continue no matter what happened in
                    Ethiopia, quite obviously. And then we had an oil company—Tenneco—that was
                    prospecting for oil; hadn't found any, as yet, and in fact, didn't find any. But
                    that was not a significant factor, really, in our outlook on the future.</p>
                <p>There was some feeling that Ethiopia had some military significance in terms of
                    access to the Red Sea. It was a bit vague, I always felt, but the Soviet Union
                    was obviously strengthening its position in the Middle East—in this very
                    important oil area—and there was some feeling in our papers on the
                    subject—strategic papers—that Ethiopia, being close to that whole oil area of
                    the Middle East, had a certain importance for that reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a little bit geopolitical in theory, but in
                        practice it's a little hard to translate it into the real factor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see the Derg, and the elements surrounding it,
                        in East-West terms? Did we see this as a potential Communist organization,
                        or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, we did. Of course there was tremendous secrecy regarding this Derg,
                    and what it was doing, and who its members were. That was understandable,
                    because in that kind of atmosphere I'm sure the Derg members were always
                    concerned that particularly military officers loyal to the Emperor, and the old
                    regime in general, might try a counter coup of some kind against them at any
                    time, and try to wipe them out. So there was a lot of secrecy involved here.</p>
                <p>It was hard to find out the names of the people in the Derg, and what views they
                    represented. We were concerned about their views, and to what extent they were
                    pro-Communist, and that type of thing. But it was a great mystery to us. We
                    hoped, at that time—and a lot of Ethiopians hoped, particularly the educated
                    civilians—hoped that all of this uproar would lead to a parliamentary, a real
                    parliamentary system. There were a number of signs along the way that were
                    fairly encouraging in that respect. At one point there was even a committee set
                    up to work out methods of establishing a more democratic system.</p>
                <p>So we were concerned about that, but there was nothing you could really do about
                    it, and it was very hard to find out, for quite some time, how great that danger
                    was. We're still talking about the beginning period. Later on it became
                    considerably more obvious that the communist-minded ones in the Derg had gotten
                    control of the organization. But that came later on, about the end of 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But now, to get the sequence, the Derg—after about six
                        months or so—put Haile Selassie under house arrest. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about that at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Because of the excellent relationship he had always had with the United
                    States, we felt a lot of sympathy for him. We regarded him as an old friend. On
                    the other hand, it had been apparent for some time now that events were clearly
                    moving in that direction; it was not a real surprise.</p>
                <p>It happened a little bit sooner, though, than anyone would have expected. You
                    didn't know, until that happened, whether all of a sudden some counter move
                    might come out of the blue, on behalf of the Emperor, that would change the
                    situation radically. There were still a lot of powerful men, who had supported
                    the Emperor, who had not been executed; they were still there. We didn't know
                    what was secretly going on, and this possibility of a counter movement was very
                    much around.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>But when the Emperor actually was placed under house arrest, it was clearly—well,
                    a matter for the Ethiopians to decide; it was not an issue between them and the
                    United States. There was no thought of our protesting, or anything like that.
                    And we continued to endeavor to keep up the best relationship we could, with the
                    authorities in power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of authorities, how was daily business done? Was
                        this becoming more and more difficult, as the government became weaker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, it was—yes. The principal difficulty was that you knew, when you
                    went to negotiate or discuss things, that you were no longer discussing them
                    with the people who mattered. I mean, to take the simplest example: if you went
                    to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a year earlier, to talk about any subject—and
                    you talked with the man, say, on the American desk—you knew that what he had to
                    say really was backed up, right up to the Emperor.</p>
                <p>But when you went in now—under these new circumstances—to talk to that same
                    person, he was as polite and friendly as ever. But you found, probably, that he
                    was much less willing and able to say anything significant. He probably would
                    tell you—whatever your representations concerned—that he would report what you
                    had to say, and eventually get a response to you.</p>
                <p>And you also had the distinct feeling that even if he personally felt that your
                    representations were entirely agreeable, and consonant with Ethiopia's
                    interests, the answer he later came back with wouldn't necessarily be of the
                    same tenor. (Laughs) You were just talking to a courier. That was basically it;
                    you knew you were just talking to a courier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in some mysterious way, if you asked, say, for
                        Ethiopian support on a United Nations vote or something, it would disappear
                        into the Derg somehow, and come back? And so you just didn't know where the
                        decisions were being made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, you knew by then that the decision was going to come from the Derg,
                    and it would get back to you eventually. And you suspected by then that the
                    answer would not be of the type that you wanted. But let me speak to this
                    question of U.N. affairs, anyway. That was a very special area that didn't
                    change much when the new regime came in.</p>
                <p>Because, basically, in Ethiopia, and let's say, not unlike the situation in many
                    African countries, our representations—and remember that Ethiopia was very
                    pro-American until this all started—were really quite pointless. What mattered
                    to them was, you might say, peer approval, by the other African states. They
                    were not going to get out of line with the general position of African countries
                    except under extraordinary circumstances. If you'd found some particular U.N.
                    issue where their interests very clearly and strongly went one way, and the
                    African countries were going the other way—all right. But it would be unusual to
                    find that kind of case.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>In general, the argumentation that we would put forward would be far less
                    significant to them than simply the fact that all, or almost all the African
                    countries were going to take a certain position. So we really couldn't hope to
                    affect their votes in the U.N. before the revolution, during the revolution, or
                    after the revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If seems to me that you must have had the entire
                        diplomatic corps, particularly those that were active in the world, rather
                        than just the pro forma representation—everybody must have been running
                        around trying to make contact in this Derg, and to find out who's who, and
                        whom to talk to, and how to cultivate it. Because that's how diplomacy
                        works. Did you and your colleagues get together and try to read the Derg tea
                        leaves, to find out where things were? And were you able to make any
                        contacts, or ties to this amorphous body?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Okay, the difference there is whether you're talking about getting
                    information about what the Derg was up to, or whether you're talking about
                    contacts with the Derg. I don't believe the members of the Derg had any direct
                    contacts with any of the Western countries, during this time. They clearly did
                    not want it. They couldn't have done it without coming under intense suspicion
                    from other members of the Derg, and that might mean their sudden death. So they
                    were not doing that.</p>
                <p>Whether they had such contacts with the Soviets, and some of the other Eastern
                    countries that were there, I don't know; perhaps they did. I just don't know.
                    They may not have, because they were still very secretive.</p>
                <p>But you're right, of course, in terms of comparing the tea leaves, and trying to
                    figure out what the Derg was up to. There was tremendous diplomatic activity in
                    exchanging rumors and reports on that.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of that at diplomatic receptions, of which there were a lot in
                    Addis Ababa. But you always had to take that information with lots of grains of
                    salt. The trouble was that one of the ambassadors could come in with something
                    he had heard, and maybe he wasn't at all sure of it but he kind of wanted to
                    test it out—this particular report—and he'd mention it to a couple of his
                    colleagues, when he first came into the reception. Well, by the time everybody
                    went home, probably every ambassador and charg� there had heard that story, you
                    know, and gotten it from all sides. (Laughs) By that time it had—to pick up this
                    term we use now—it had become the conventional wisdom. (Laughs) Just because one
                    guy brought it in one time, to test it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had nothing else to work with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Not much.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Emperor had been put into house arrest, you had
                        this sort of shadow, but powerful government. You had a shell of a
                        government which you used as a courier to do things. But how did it play out
                        after that? We're talking about the end of 1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, we haven't quite gotten there yet. It's only still about August,
                    1984, when they put the Emperor under house arrest. And the other thing that
                    happened at that time was that a military general took over as head of
                    state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: This was General Aman Andom. He was one of the very few generals in the
                    Ethiopian Army who had a reputation for liberalism, and for having, to some
                    extent, stood up against the Emperor on a previous occasion. So he was really
                    quite widely respected in the Ethiopian military establishment, but definitely
                    not one of the Emperor's men. So he seemed to be a fairly logical choice for
                    this position, at that time. But they were very anxious—that is the people
                    behind Andom, the Derg particularly— about what the reaction in Ethiopia would
                    be when Andom became the head of state.</p>
                <p>What happened there was that I got a telephone call—I think it was the day after,
                    or maybe two days after the house arrest of the Emperor, asking me to come and
                    see the new head of state, General Andom. They wanted me to come on very short
                    notice—about two hours after that. I felt this was clearly the right thing to
                    do, and as I said before, there was certainly not going to be any question of a
                    U.S. protest about the Emperor having been deposed. That was up to Ethiopia. So
                    I felt there was no question that it was entirely proper for me to go, and deal
                    with him as a head of state.</p>
                <p>What I hadn't realized—not that it would have made any difference—was that the
                    reason the Derg had wanted this to take place was that they were going to make a
                    photo opportunity out of the whole situation.</p>
                <p>When I got there—in the outer office of General Andom, and was waiting—I was
                    aware that in the office I was obviously going to be ushered into, there seemed
                    to be a fair amount of noise back there, and confusion, and sounds of things
                    being shifted around. That puzzled me.</p>
                <p>After a short wait they opened the door and ushered me in. Well, I came right in
                    to a battery of lights, so they could tape the scene for television. And there
                    it was, that night, that the American Charg� d'affaires had called on the new
                    head of state.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The Derg was still very much worried at that time about the domestic reaction to
                    the deposition of the Emperor. And it wasn't just the American Charg�, they also
                    called in some of the Western European ambassadors. All this was on television
                    that night, you see. They were showing their people—here are all these
                    governments around the world that have accepted the head of state. So that was a
                    very interesting case.</p>
                <p>Neither one of us said anything important, you know. It was strictly a photo
                    opportunity. He more or less said, “I just wanted to meet you.” And I said, “I
                    wish you well.” (Laughs) That was about it. But anyway, I was glad that I didn't
                    say anything about recognition. The Ethiopians were annoyed with one or two of
                    the ambassadors who slipped in some reservations that their visit should not be
                    construed as a final decision on the question of recognition. The Derg did not
                    like that at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hadn't had any instructions, or really any time for
                        instructions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you just went.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes. I was sure it was the right thing to do, and it didn't bother me. So
                    I just went ahead.</p>
                <p>Well, to go on with the chronology, the trouble is I don't want to get into too
                    much detail here. General Andom disagreed with the Derg, it soon became
                    apparent, primarily over Eritrea. He was an Eritrean himself and he was in favor
                    of reaching a compromise agreement of some kind with the Eritreans. The Derg had
                    decided on the use of military force to put down the Eritrean revolt, and they
                    wanted to go that way. So because of these differences with General Andom, they
                    really executed him, in his own house, in a fire-fight.</p>
                <p>Then they chose a new military head of state, somebody who was fairly well-known,
                    Tafgrre Bonti. He was still a general, in other words, not one of the members of
                    the Derg.</p>
                <p>Then the next development of real importance was in, I think, November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WYMAN: Seventy-four, still, yes. They had arrested, by this time, a lot of the
                    leading men in the country. And in November, one night, they executed 60 of them
                    all at once. There had been a discussion before then of bringing them to trial;
                    there had been a lot of that in the papers. They were going to bring these men
                    to trial for their crimes: embezzlement, and corruption, and this kind of thing.
                    And then they executed them overnight.</p>
                <p>So that's what I referred to as the beginning of the violent stage of the
                    revolution. Of course that shocked everybody in the country and out of the
                    country. Very shortly thereafter, on the basis of instructions from Washington,
                    we informed them that our military aid was being suspended. We very carefully
                    did not say “terminated,” we said “suspended.” And it was made clear by
                    implication, I would say, that a continuation of this type of brutality might
                    prevent a resumption of military aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often when relations are poor with a country, the
                        ambassador is withdrawn, and a charg� is left. Was the point made that no
                        new ambassador was going to be named?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: It was never mentioned; we never told them anything on that subject.
                    Curiously enough, Washington never told me anything on that subject, either.
                    (Laughs) I told them, from time to time, that in spite of our professions to the
                    authorities of our desire to go on helping the government with economic
                    assistance and military assistance, and of our good will and so forth—I said
                    obviously they tend to take these statements with a grain of salt, when we don't
                    appoint a new ambassador, and they should be aware of that. Those telegrams went
                    in, and I never got a response from Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after the bloodbath—when they killed the leaders—you
                        must have known, being a political observer—that within Washington, nobody
                        was going to send an American ambassador out under those circumstances, for
                        some time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew you were there for the long term.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, although the greater length of time without an ambassador was prior
                    to that. It was still a few months away but most of the time I was there as
                    Charg� had been prior to that bloodbath.</p>
                <p>I think at this point I ought to come back to discuss an area that we haven't
                    gone into, one which I think is clearly the most important aspect in terms of
                    our relationship with Ethiopia. That's the question of our military assistance
                    program.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Now, in what I've said before, I think you can see the beginnings of this story,
                    when I talked about the Soviets backing Somalia with far more military equipment
                    than we were providing to Ethiopia. The key thing, I think, to have in mind
                    here—in terms of U.S.-Ethiopian relations—was that prior to the revolution—and
                    in the early stages of the revolution, and also right up to the time I left
                    Ethiopia—the one subject the Ethiopians wanted to discuss with us any day and
                    every day was increased military assistance.</p>
                <p>As I say, they had very little to say about the drought. They never really came
                    to us and wanted additional economic assistance, as such. But they hammered away
                    at us constantly on, “Why can't we have more military assistance?” And quite
                    understandably, because they not only had a very serious insurgency going on in
                    Eritrea, but they also had a threat from Somalia—that had openly said it wanted
                    this chunk of territory of theirs—growing all the time. So they were very
                    concerned about it. They wanted to get far more, in terms of military
                    assistance, from us than we were giving them.</p>
                <p>Now, what we were providing them in military assistance, when I arrived, was
                    approximately $9,000,000 annually. In response to all of this urging from them,
                    constantly, we finally got up, I believe, to a level of about $12,000,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still pretty small potatoes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Of course. Now, what needs to be taken into account, at that point, is
                    that this was still in the period when South Vietnam was in existence, and the
                    American Congress was dominated by the Vietnam syndrome; and when military
                    assistance—in political terms—was an obscene word, practically.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>To go to congressional committees, and try and get an increase in military
                    assistance—at the time when military assistance was being cut back because of
                    the Vietnam syndrome—was an impossible job, frankly. You could try. I guess I
                    shouldn't say impossible, because we did manage to get these very slight
                    increases, but beyond slight increases was obviously impossible. There was no
                    way. Congress just could not focus on the particular Ethiopian-Somalian
                    situation to that extent. They were dominated by this general idea that military
                    assistance—we've got to cut back, it's a bad thing.So we were really boxed in on
                    that score, and yet this was the one thing that all these Ethiopian governments
                    cared about a great deal. And there was an interesting aspect of that, too. We
                    had to provide an explanation to the Ethiopian government of why we didn't
                    provide more military assistance, in view of this Somali threat. There were
                    basically, I think, only two arguments that could be used. One was that we
                    really think you're exaggerating the Somali threat; it's not really as bad as it
                    looks. And you would support that thesis one way or another. Or, the other
                    argument you could use was to talk about the effect of Vietnam on the U.S.
                    Congress, and on its attitudes towards military assistance. And explain, in
                    practical terms, the limitations this placed on us when we tried to increase
                    military assistance for Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>The telegrams we would get from the Department stressed the first argument about
                    the threat from Somalia being overdone, much more than the other one. I tried
                    hard—well, put it this way—I stretched the instructions I had just as far as I
                    possibly could to emphasize the congressional difficulty, rather than the
                    overblown threat from Somalia. Really, for two reasons.</p>
                <p>One, I felt that their concerns for Somalia were perfectly well-founded, and in
                    fact, they proved to be. Secondly, I realized—well, I could naturally be more
                    conscious of this than they would tend to be in Washington—that if you went to
                    the Ethiopian authorities at that time, and said, “Look, you don't really need
                    to worry about Somalia,” they would write us off—particularly those of us who
                    were talking to them there in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>They would think, “Well, obviously what Washington is getting from its people in
                    Mogadishu, and from Addis, is just total nonsense. We're dealing here with some
                    idiots. Talking to these guys is hopeless, because they're idiots; they can't
                    see the situation.”</p>
                <p>And I thought, “Really, we don't want to get that reaction from them, because it
                    will impact on everything, if they regard us as idiots not worth talking to.” If
                    you put the stress on the other factor—how military assistance looks to Congress
                    because of Vietnam—I don't think it will be as damaging in terms of their whole
                    attitude towards our government, and its representatives to them, as the other
                    viewpoint would be. So that's why I did it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're talking about this, what sort of reports were
                        you getting from the other side of the moon? And that is, from our embassy
                        in Mogadishu, in Somalia, at the time, about the Somali threat, and the
                        buildup there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, we were getting reports that gave us a fairly good idea of the large
                    dimensions of the assistance that was coming from the Soviets; that was pretty
                    apparent. I don't think that they had all the details, because of course the
                    Soviets were concealing that to some extent. But it was certainly clear from
                    their reporting that the amount of military assistance, and the actual physical
                    equipment that the Soviets were pouring into Somalia, far exceeded what we were
                    doing for Ethiopia. That was the key factor.</p>
                <p>And that was why I personally felt there was plenty of reason for the Ethiopians
                    to be concerned about this situation. I have a feeling that in some of the
                    telegrams I sent we indicated that the threat looked pretty bad to us—from
                    Somalia—seen from Addis. And I believe that the Department didn't really answer
                    us directly, but whenever they would send us some instructions to be conveyed to
                    the Ethiopians, as to why we had to turn down their latest request to increase
                    the military assistance by a vast amount—there would always be this point in
                    there that really the Somali threat isn't as big as it appears.</p>
                <p>Now let me weave this into the chronology—this military assistance point, again.
                    As I say, this emphasis from their governments on this point, and on increasing
                    it; and a desire to have meetings with us, attended by their top-ranking
                    generals—which we did participate in—all of this was very pronounced, all
                    through this period that I was there.</p>
                <p>I remember it most vividly at one particular meeting, shortly after the Emperor
                    had been deposed, and General Aman Andom had come in as the head of state—and I
                    met with him. The one subject that he wanted to talk about was military
                    assistance. He hadn't discussed it with me before, himself. He gave me the
                    standard approach, as to how great the Somali threat was, and how they had
                    openly said long ago they were going to have the Ogaden—they must have it back.
                    How, as the long friend of the United States, Ethiopia needed help from us, and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>I gave him, in a little more extended version than usual even, all the
                    response—although it was difficult to talk too long on the subject, particularly
                    when I didn't want to put much emphasis on this point of the Somali threat not
                    being very great—but I made it as clear to him as I could why we could not do
                    more. And he kept coming back with questions, and so forth. We had quite an
                    extended meeting on the subject, and I really felt that I'd said everything that
                    could be said, and said it as clearly as it could be said. And as we were saying
                    goodbye, he said to me—his exact words were—”Mr. Wyman, just tell Washington
                    that I still don't understand.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's the hardest thing in the world to explain the
                        American political system, which is driven by internal politics. Well, do
                        you feel that as things played out there, that our military aid—with a
                        modest increase, or more than a little, it still would have been on the
                        modest side, compared to what we were pouring into Israel, and other
                        places—would have been a real factor in maybe changing things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, my reaction to that question—when you put it that way—is that the
                    question is totally academic, for the reasons I gave. There was no possibility
                    whatsoever of Congress doing that. So to speculate as to what level of
                    assistance could have had an impact on the situation, is just quite fruitless, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it could be academic, but we're also looking at this
                        as what are tools of diplomacy. And so there might be a lesson learned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: I agree with you there. Okay, let me take that point up. There is a very
                    important lesson here, because the principal point I want to make about all this
                    is that this question of military assistance was the crucial one that led
                    Ethiopia to depart from and abandon its long-standing virtual alliance with the
                    United States, and turn to the Soviet Union. So while on the one hand, the
                    possibility was not there for us to do more, in terms of military assistance, it
                    did prove to be the decisive factor in the situation, not surprisingly.</p>
                <p>Because what would eventually happen here was that as the Derg increasingly
                    realized, over time, that they couldn't get a really substantial increase in
                    military assistance from the United States; and as they increasingly discovered
                    that their military efforts in Eritrea were not sufficient to defeat the
                    resistance, and retake Eritrea for them; and as they saw the Somali threat still
                    getting bigger all the time, with the Soviets pouring in more and more aid, they
                    became, I think, fairly desperate about this situation. They came, inevitably,
                    to the one conclusion: we've got to have much stronger military forces than we
                    have now, we can't get them from the United States, we're not able to purchase
                    them, we don't have the money to purchase them from outsiders—the British, the
                    French, or something like that. What's left in the whole world? The only thing
                    left is the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Now, of course the big difficulty there was the fact that the Soviets were aiding
                    the other side. (Laughs) And these developments, then—going over to the Soviet
                    side—that took place after I left, and I don't know the details of it at all.
                    But what is obvious is that finally they wanted so much to get that military
                    assistance, and made that so evident to the Soviets, that eventually the Soviets
                    took a very questionable decision, I think, from the standpoint of their own
                    interests. They decided, well, all right, we'll go along with that, and we will
                    give them a lot of military assistance, because we've got a group in control of
                    that country that would really respond to that, and we can establish a very
                    solid relationship with them.</p>
                <p>Now I have the impression that at the beginning, the Soviets really thought they
                    might be able to have this solid relationship with both countries: Ethiopia and
                    Somalia. And of course that quickly proved impossible. But this is going beyond
                    the period that I was there, so I'm not going to talk about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>You can say, in a sense, that as we'd lost China after World War II, we lost
                    Ethiopia to the Soviets. And clearly what did it was the fact that they could
                    get so much more from the Soviets, in terms of military assistance, than they
                    could from us.</p>
                <p>The Soviets came in, eventually, with military assistance that made what we had
                    previously provided—at least on an annual basis—absolute peanuts.</p>
                <p>So in that sense, here's where the inevitable logic of the situation comes
                    in—that they wound up in the Soviet camp. It's kind of an unusual situation;
                    that's what I think is fascinating. I don't think you find too many situations
                    in recent history that have been of that type, where the military assistance
                    itself was considered so enormous in importance, compared to all other factors,
                    and where in the East-West competition, the Soviets had this tremendous
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, but also the timing was such that you had the—I
                        don't know if you want to call it the Brezhnev doctrine, or the Brezhnev
                        policy—in full flower, at the same time; with the end of Vietnam syndrome
                        becoming so strong in the United States. Where we were withdrawing at the
                        same time the Soviets thought that they really could do things in Africa.
                        Because looking at it later—I mean, the Soviets don't want to play this game
                        anymore, and we don't—we're taking a little more rational approach to
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did things play out while you were there? You
                        were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: I left in the summer of '75. And so far we had talked about reaching this
                    period of the executions in November. Well, the radicalism of the regime became
                    even more apparent in those remaining months, because they introduced the
                    nationalization of agricultural land. And just as I was leaving, they were
                    starting to introduce the nationalization of business firms, too.They were
                    still- -at the time I left, the summer of '75—still relying on us; we still had
                    all our military advisors there, and they were still getting the military
                    assistance from us. A lot of the propaganda that was coming out of the
                    government was unfriendly towards the United States, and Western countries
                    generally, and certainly pro-Soviet, and pro-Communist.</p>
                <p>But they had this key relationship still going on with us, because again, while
                    it was a strange looking situation, I think you can see the logic of the
                    situation. It had to remain that way because military strength came first, and
                    they weren't going to abandon us until they could get the support from the
                    Soviets, no matter how much they might dislike us, or be disgusted with us for
                    not giving them more.</p>

                        Were Americans particularly in danger, or anything like that, at that
                        particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Well, that's a good question. We never really knew. With all that was
                    going on—all these signs of mutiny, and authority disappearing and crumbling,
                    and the revolutionary group gradually taking power—it was obviously a very
                    volatile situation and inherently risky. The dangers didn't actually—for
                    Americans, at that time—materialize. We were worried about it, quite worried
                    about it.</p>
                <p>I remember on one occasion addressing all of the wives in town, at a special
                    meeting, to give them my analysis of the whole situation in the country. The
                    gist of what I had to say was that the potential for real problems for Americans
                    appeared to be there, but that we hadn't really quite gotten into that area yet,
                    and that I would certainly sound the alarm at the first time that we really did
                    get into that area. We were kind of circling it, and I couldn't see that we were
                    getting into it.</p>
                <p>There was one incident that did take place, but it was not so much connected with
                    the revolution. In Eritrea there were some Americans who were captured by the

                <p>WYMAN: Right, yes. That was not a problem that we had with the Derg at all, and
                    eventually it was solved. We had to spend a great deal of time on it, and it was
                    a dangerous situation. It did work out; they all got back safely, thank

                <p>WYMAN: There were a couple of effects there that were immediately visible. A lot
                    of the people that we had been friendly with, really did not want to have
                    contact with us anymore, after a certain point. Because they felt it was too
                    dangerous. So of course we took account of that, and were able to understand it,
                    and didn't do anything we felt might compromise them.</p>

                        who wanted to get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: There wasn't really much that we could do about that, because the ones
                    that needed help were ones that knew they'd get out only if they completely
                    escaped the notice of the authorities. Those people were not going to telegraph
                    their intentions by trying to get a U.S. visa or anything like that. They
                    weren't coming to us at all; they were just trying to get out surreptitiously.
                    Because it was quite early in the game that the authorities announced that they
                    were going to take a very sharp look at anybody who wanted to leave the country.
                    It was generally very difficult for any of the influential people to leave the
                    country after that. So there wasn't much we could do about that situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left then in the summer of 75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the new ambassador arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: Yes, Art Hummel had come in—I believe it was February of '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he come with any particular instructions to take a new
                        look, or did he have anything in his pocket, such as attempts to influence
                        using aid, or anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYMAN: I don't believe so; I don't recall anything of that nature. I don't think
                    there were any new instructions that he had.</p>
                <p>I think we've covered the points of greatest interest here. The finale, in a
                    sense, was still to come, after I left, when they did turn to the Soviets. Seen
                    from the Washington standpoint it didn't have much of an impact here, but in
                    terms of the local picture it was such a very dramatic turnaround when the
                    Soviets went on their side. Somalia, then deciding that it was now or never in
                    terms of an attack, went ahead and attacked. And the Cuban troops came in, and
                    so forth. But that all came later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>As I say, there was a certain inevitability that the Ethiopian government at that
                    time would go in that direction, provided the Soviets were willing to leave
                    behind all their investment in Somalia to do that. The answer may be that at the
                    beginning the Soviets thought they could be friendly with both sides. There was
                    a report that Castro was supposed to come over and try and mediate, and convince
                    the two countries that the Soviets were going to be a strong supporter of both
                    of them. But then that option was really blown up when the Somalian government
                    went ahead and went in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to thank you very much. I think this was a crucial
                        time in our relations with the country, and I think you have pointed out
                        some of the factors. Thank you.</hi>
