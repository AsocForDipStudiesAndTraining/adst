                <p>AMBASSADOR JOHN R. BURKE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 26, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, how did you become interested in foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: My interest in foreign affairs really grew out of my service in the Navy
                    during World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I was a naval officer serving in the Pacific in the Third and Fifth
                    Fleets. And I led a detachment of sailors ashore on August 29, 1945 and
                    established communications for Admiral Badger, who was the commander of the
                    occupation force of the Tokyo Bay area. And, I guess, as a consequence of this
                    experience and actually some other ports of call made in the Far East aboard the
                    aircraft carrier Hancock, in which I sort of began to develop an interest in
                    foreign affairs generally. I was then a 20-year-old ensign and had not yet
                    finished my undergraduate degree or graduate degrees and, therefore, determined
                    that I was going to conclude my studies in the field of US diplomatic history,
                    which I proceeded to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you known anything about diplomacy before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Not beyond what I read and just from that, every basic courses that I'd
                    taken in US history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BURKE: I went to Lawrence College for part of my undergraduate time, and I got my
                    bachelor's degree from University of Wisconsin, and I got my master's at
                    Wisconsin as well. I had the good fortune of having Fred Harvey Harrington as my
                    major professor both as an undergraduate and graduate at Wisconsin, and Fred
                    Harrington's specialty was US diplomatic history. He's got several books in the
                    field. And he later became president of the University of Wisconsin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you get into the Foreign Service itself? You
                        came in when? In 1956?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I came in in September of 1956. I wrote the Foreign Service exam—I can't
                    remember precisely; it must have been the previous December, passed it, passed
                    the oral. And because I had some graduate work to finish up, I asked for a
                    couple of months delay before coming on duty, and, therefore, there is that gap
                    between December of 1955 and September of 1956 when I actually came in. I had
                    the misfortune, however, to have been appointed a Class 6 officer, and by the
                    time I came on duty, they had established the eight grades, so I came in as an
                    FSO-8 instead of an FSO-6.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's too bad. I had come in a year before and went from
                        an FSO 6 just to an FSO 8 It was rather traumatic. We're obviously going to
                        concentrate on the later part of your career, but your first job sounds
                        quite interesting. I'd like to talk a little about it. You went to Bangkok,
                        didn't you? How did that develop, and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, my first post was Bangkok. I had expressed a preference for service
                    in the Far East, because I felt I knew the region and already had a basic
                    knowledge of it and wanted to build on it. When I got to Bangkok, I was
                    originally slotted for a political officer job.</p>
                <p>However, when I arrived, they had worked a couple of switches within the
                    staffing, and the job available and open to me was one as deputy chief of the
                    SEATO section. That, in effect, was the US permanent delegation to SEATO that
                    consisted of two men, myself and John Calvin Hill, Jr., who was my boss. And the
                    two of us really handled the day-to-day work and representation of the US on the
                    permanent working group of SEATO, which was the body that sat regularly in
                    Bangkok and handled the activities of the organization on the political side.
                    There was representation from the other six member governments as well drawn
                    from resident embassies in Bangkok and the other member governments. So it was
                    an excellent experience, and I got my feet totally wet right up to the hips, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you and those around you at the embassy view
                        SEATO at that time? Because today it's looked upon as being sort of an
                        ineffective nonstart of a treaty. How did you feel about it at that time? It
                        was brand new or almost brand new.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BURKE: It was fairly new, of course, as you say. It's kind of curious in a way in
                    that my first job in the service was in Bangkok on the SEATO delegation, and
                    then later I came back to Bangkok as DCM, and I was present at the termination
                    of SEATO and sat in on the last meeting of the council representatives when
                    SEATO was dissolved finally.</p>
                <p>I do feel that SEATO was “bad-mouthed” by several people who didn't really
                    understand that we got over time, I think, a great deal of bang for the buck out
                    of SEATO. We never spent much money on it. Our contribution on an annual basis
                    when I was there in the mid-'''50s, I think, ran something like $300,000 a year.
                    Plus we had a few people detailed to the international staff, and we had some
                    military people on the military committee as well. But the total outlay from the
                    US side was really minimal in modern terms or even then terms of what we were
                    spending on NATO and, I guess, SENTO and the [unclear] it was. But as an
                    organization, I think it performed some useful services particularly in terms of
                    providing the regional members—by that I mean, of course, the Philippines and
                    Thailand and Pakistan—with a great opportunity to work together on a variety of
                    projects. And I think the Thai, by their experience, gained a great deal of
                    savior-faire, if you will, in the international realm which they built on
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is really their first international organization,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, other than the U.N.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your ambassador and the rest of the staff view
                        SEATO? Did you feel sort of a stepchild, or were you—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, Max Bishop, who was the ambassador when I first arrived, I think
                    took a reasonable interest in it and did participate fully. He left the
                    day-to-day running, of course, to John Hill, who just, by the by, is probably
                    one of the most extraordinary Foreign Service officers I ever served with in
                    terms of his intellectual capacity and his negotiating skills. John Hill, I
                    think—and I say this, I'm also including comments that I received from British,
                    Australian, New Zealand diplomats who were there present at the time—they all
                    felt that John Hill was the guiding genius behind SEATO in the early days and in
                    the early years, and any effectiveness they had was due to a large extent to
                    Hill's competence and abilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>But getting back to the question, Max Bishop was quite content to leave the
                    running to Hill, and it was done extremely well. The successor to Max Bishop was
                    Alex Johnson, and Alex, I think, had an interest in SEATO. I don't really have a
                    feel for how he regarded the organization in terms of its long-term value or
                    what we might be getting out of it in terms of national interest. But he
                    certainly participated very actively in all the meetings of the council
                    representatives [unclear].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view Vietnam from there, I mean, your personal
                        view? Was it a problem at that—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: No. In those days, of course, Ngo Dinh Diem had just begun to consolidate
                    his position in Saigon. And I had friends in the embassy in Saigon and used to
                    travel back and forth on holiday to Saigon and traveled around the country, to a
                    certain extent, with them a lot. It was still quite easy to make that trip by
                    road. I talked to the people in the embassy about their view of SEATO, and
                    certainly SEATO looked at Vietnam very carefully, looked at the insurgency and
                    looked at the threat posed by the insurgents in Vietnam and elsewhere and what
                    had been French Indochina.</p>
                <p>At the same time, of course, they were protocol states— Cambodia, Laos, Thailand
                    and Vietnam—under the SEATO treaty, and there was no obligation. But it was not
                    as clearly defined as one might have hoped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, really, your next assignment—we'll sort of move
                        rather quickly—you were in Paris as a consular officer from '58 to '61. Then
                        you're in the Department from '61 to '62 when you went into Vietnamese
                        language training. And so to move to what was your major area of
                        specialization, what attracted you to specialize in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, my interest, as I said before, was in Asia and particularly in
                    Southeast Asia even before I came into the Foreign Service. I had taken courses
                    in Far Eastern history and especially the economy in the Far East as a minor
                    working on my master's and then working on the doctorate, and I wanted to build
                    on that experience. When I came back to the Department from Paris, I was in BNA
                    as the assistant UK desk officer, whose responsibility is for Ireland and—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: BNA stands for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: British Commonwealth and Northern Europe. It's an office within the EUR,
                    the European bureau. And a friend of mine, whom I had met, as a matter of fact,
                    in Saigon, was then in Personnel.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>And he contacted me one day and said, “Would you be interested in going into
                    Vietnamese language training? We are very interested in developing some
                    competence among the FSOs in Vietnamese.”</p>
                <p>And I thought about it for about one day and said, “It seems to be a very
                    sensible thing to do.”</p>
                <p>I was convinced, personally, that Vietnam was going to become more and more in
                    the forefront in terms of US foreign policy. So I thought that this would be an
                    excellent career opportunity and be an excellent opportunity just in terms of my
                    own interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking a little about career opportunities, these
                        interviews are designed for somebody who might not know too much about the
                        Foreign Service and how people get directed. How did you see it as a career
                        opportunity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, when an officer comes into the Department, it doesn't take him too
                    long, unless he's terrible obtuse, to get a feel for where the opportunities
                    lie, career officers. Bureaus, geographic bureaus, functional bureaus had
                    reputations that are pretty well known both by personnel and personalities
                    working within the bureaus and by people outside the bureaus. Some of the
                    geographic bureaus traditionally have a good reputation as being good places to
                    serve because they have been over the years fairly well run by competent
                    officers, senior officers. And the work they did caught the attention of the
                    seventh floor and also the White House and, of course, Washington.</p>
                <p>The Bureau of East Asian Affairs, I think, had a reputation as one of the
                    strongest bureaus in the Department over the years. When I was in BNA,
                    obviously, I was working in the Bureau of European Affairs. But quite honestly
                    looking about, I wasn't all that interested in one of the more traditional jobs
                    in one of the larger European embassies, which I might have expected in a BNA
                    assignment. So I was interested in getting back to the Far East and to work
                    within the Bureau of East Asian Affairs—it was Far East, of course, in those
                    days. The name didn't change until 1968.</p>
                <p>So I really jumped at the chance to take Vietnamese, going to Saigon and—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of officer would you characterize—this is the
                        early '''60s—was taking Vietnamese? I mean, was there a characterization
                        would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I'm trying to think of some of the people who were in the language
                    program with me: Bill Marsh, who is still in the Service; Dick Holbrooke, who
                    later got out of the Service and came back into the Department as the assistant
                    secretary for the EA; Vladimir Lehovich, who had a very distinguished career in
                    political military affairs; Jim Rosenthal, who later became ambassador in Guinea
                    and is still in the Service; David Engle, Tony Lake, and Sam Thomsen.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was, you might say, a high caliber type of motivated
                        person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I would say so. The group that I was associated with, I would rate them
                    all very highly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went to Saigon when, and what were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I went to Saigon in—I think I arrived in June of 1963. The way the
                    Vietnamese language course was set up, the first six months were Washington at
                    FSI and with three additional months in Saigon. So my first couple of months in
                    Saigon, I was told to bring in the language but doing some odd jobs in the
                    political section in terms of covering things that might not otherwise get
                    covered by the political section, which was fairly—it was a lean political
                    section at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the later half of '63 can be pointed to as the
                        crucial thing and probably with the finger more pointing towards the month
                        of November, October-November. And so you were there on the scene. Before we
                        get to that, how did you view the situation from your vantage point as a
                        relatively junior officer in the summer of '63 in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I should back up just a bit. On my way to Saigon, because of my
                    experience in BNA, and because I had been the assistant UK desk officer and the
                    Irish desk officer, I was asked to stop off en route in Ireland. And I was there
                    as an advance man during the visit of President Kennedy.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, Pierre Salinger announced in Dublin that the White House
                    had decided to name Henry Cabot Lodge as the ambassador to Saigon replacing
                    Fritz Nolting. So I continued on to Saigon after the presidential visit. And, of
                    course, Fritz Nolting, whom I called shortly after my arrival, was already
                    packing his bags and getting ready to terminate his mission. And Cabot Lodge did
                    arrive in, I think, around the 23rd of August in 1963. So it was a very
                    interesting time, a very active time in the embassy. A lot of things were going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the officers view Nolting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BURKE: I would say that the officers had a regard for Nolting. Many of the
                    officers had served with him in Paris, and he brought several people with him at
                    that time to Saigon when he was named ambassador. You had Noel who was a
                    political counselor. You had Bill Trueheart, the DCM. And then you had Bob
                    Miller, who was number two, the man for the political section. So I think all of
                    those people had a high regard for Nolting. He was certainly a very charming
                    individual. And I thought he was a very dedicated professional, really, in his
                    approach to the job of being ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was, at that point, the view of the Vietnamese
                        government and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Toward?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, your view and the view of those around you, the
                        political section and other officers in the embassy, how did you view the
                        situation in the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, the situation, really, in the summer of 1963 in Saigon was somewhat
                    turbulent, because in May you had the beginning of the so-called Buddhist crisis
                    which began at Qu�, the incident of May 8 in which Tri Quang organized a
                    demonstration demanding that Buddhist in conjunction with their observance of
                    Buddha's birthday be permitted to fly the Buddhist flag on some of the pagodas,
                    and also they demanded that their demonstration be broadcast over the local
                    radio station.</p>
                <p>An incident developed on the night of May 8th. It's also been looked at and
                    examined and reported oftentimes inaccurately. It was a very confused moment, in
                    any event. Because of the confrontation before the radio station, there were a
                    number of casualties and some Vietnamese demonstrators died. And this triggered
                    a rather turbulent period. The demonstrations by the Buddhists began to spread
                    down into Saigon and picked up by students, the students demonstrating on behalf
                    of the Buddhists and demonstrating against the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem.</p>
                <p>And there were also, of course, many American journalists on the scene, some of
                    whom made their reputations in Saigon in the summer of '63, notably, Malcolm
                    Brown, who was reporting for the Associated Press; Neil Sheehan, who was
                    reporting for the United Press International; and Halberstam—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: David Halberstam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BURKE: Who was reporting for the New York Times. These were young journalists. I
                    think with the exception of one, this was their first post abroad as reporters,
                    as foreign correspondents. And they began to file extensive reports on the
                    developing conflict between the Buddhists and the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem. Their
                    reports began to make front pages of the newspapers throughout the US, and they
                    brought a certain amount of pressure to bear on the Kennedy Administration and
                    on the government to do something in terms of intervening to somehow help
                    resolve the situation between the Buddhists and the Dinh Diem regime.</p>
                <p>We were already committed to supporting the Dinh Diem regime against the
                    Communist insurgency, which had well begun in 1960-61, and we didn't yet, of
                    course, have combat troops in Vietnam. However, we had a growing commitment in
                    terms of military advisors. I think we may have had about 15,000 thereabouts in
                    the country already. And certainly we had begun to supply important resources in
                    the meantime, commodity import program, resources to the government of Vietnam.
                    So it was in our interest, obviously, to try and solve this—all this regarded by
                    some as a side show—main problem of insurgency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, involved to the extent that we were reporting to the Department, to
                    Washington, what was going on in terms of the demonstrations. Of course, the
                    reports by the journalists were what caught the public attention, and you had
                    that one remarkable photograph taken by, I think it may have been Malcolm Brown.
                    I didn't know he was a photographer, but he took the famous photograph of a
                    Buddhist, Quang Duc, who was really not well known at all. He was a gentleman
                    who one noon sat himself down in a major intersection in Saigon, poured a can of
                    gasoline over himself and set fire to himself. This was such a remarkable
                    photograph; it was just flashed around the world. It was a photograph similar to
                    the famous one during the war in China in 1937 when the baby was set—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a baby on railroad tracks, yes. Well, now, did you
                        have any contact with these newspaper reporters? I mean, were they
                        cultivating you? Were you cultivating them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I had limited contact with them and knew them all. I used to chat with
                    them from time to time. But their principal contacts were people like the head
                    of USIS and John—the name escapes me just now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can fill it in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BURKE: He wrote a book subsequently called Mission in Torment. And he was the
                    principal contract with the correspondents. But they did have social contacts
                    with some of the other members of the embassy staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got into the political section—you were there
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I'd say I was getting toward full time in August of '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the political section at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, Mel , as I mentioned was the political counselor and Bob Miller was
                    his deputy. And Mel has retired. He was ambassador to Central African Republic
                    and then Liberia before his retirement. And Bob Miller was ambassador to
                    Malaysia and the Ivory Coast and is still in the Service. But that was the
                    lineup. There were several other officers: Jim Rosenthal was in the embassy at
                    the time; Bill Marsh was in the embassy; Melvin Levin; Charles Bloughery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at it, would you say the embassy was sort of
                        one mind? I mean, this was a very “Do we support Diem or do we cut the
                        ground out from under him?” It was certainly a debate in other areas. How
                        did the men of the political section view the Diem regime up to November
                        1963?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I don't think there was any single view. There were shades of
                    opinion across the spectrum. There were probably one or two who felt that Diem
                    had to go, the Diem regime had to go. There were, I think, others on the other
                    side of the spectrum who felt that, “Okay, if Ngo Dinh Diem must go, who will
                    succeed him and how will the succession be arranged, and what will this do to
                    the effort to [unclear] the communist insurgency?”</p>
                <p>I'd say there was a great deal of debate back and forth that would go up and down
                    from day to day. As far as Ambassador Nolting is concerned, on the basis of my
                    conversations with him which were limited then during that period because we
                    didn't overlap all that long, but I have spoken with him subsequently and read
                    the article he had before in the Foreign Service Journal and his book that
                    appeared recently, and his position really hasn't deviated. He felt that it
                    would be a mistake to consider a change of administration because the presidency
                    of Ngo Dinh Diem was still valid, that the government was capable of functioning
                    and that the Buddhist affair was a regrettable side show, in fact, distracting
                    people from the real problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>There were some people in the political section, I think, who probably learned
                    upon review that once you get rid of—it's clear now from all the documents that
                    have been released, the various books that have been done, that there was an
                    interest particularly in Washington on the part of then Assistant Secretary
                    Roger Hilsman, possibly to a lesser extent Averell Harriman and others within
                    the administration who felt that the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem had lost its
                    effectiveness and probably should be replaced by a more effective regime,
                    possibly the more elite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think, was there a proprietary feeling within the
                        embassy? You know, we're doing this, and we really should rather than sit
                        back and watch events, that we felt we should get more and more, you know,
                        not concerned but really manipulate things within this government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I think there were probably some people who held that view. There were
                    others, of course, who had served abroad and appreciated the fact that
                    regardless of the American stake in a foreign country, the number of things you
                    can do, the amount of influence you can wield is quite limited. I think that
                    it's—I had been through a coup in Bangkok. And I remember how that unfolded and
                    what role the US mission was able to play in all of that scenario, and it was an
                    extremely limited role if any role at all.</p>
                <p>So I'm afraid that I felt that it's well and good to say, “We have an important
                    stake here, the government must change its way to do certain things to
                    accommodate us in view of our investment.” And I think that in most foreign
                    environments where you end up in this would be indigenous. After all, the people
                    of the country, in the final analysis, say to themselves, “This is our country,
                    and this is our government, and we will accept advice up to a point if it's
                    consistent with our view.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feel for how the CIA—its role there? Did
                        you deal with them? I mean, did they have their own policy or own line? How
                        did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I was, as I say, a fairly junior officer in those days, and I had
                    little contact with that side of the house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, how did it play out for you personally, and how did
                        you see the November situation of '63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I think it's important to mention Cabot Lodge's arrival and the way
                    he chose to operate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, if you would talk about his method of
                        operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. I think that one must bear in mind that Cabot Lodge had been the
                    Republican nominee for vice president in the election of 1960 which John F.
                    Kennedy won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Narrowly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Narrowly. And I'm sure that Cabot Lodge would be accepted to come to
                    Saigon as ambassador. He brought thought to himself, “Why am I being chosen to
                    come?” He's a very shrewd political animal—he was—and he could, I'm sure, put
                    two and two together and probably arrive at the conclusion, although he never
                    stated this to me—although he's stated several things to me on other
                    subjects—that possibly his selection was an effort on the part of the Kennedy
                    Administration to make the Vietnam effort more bipartisan and get the Republican
                    involvement.</p>
                <p>Lodge arrived on the scene, as I said, on August 23rd—I believe that's the
                    correct date. He arrived at a particularly crucial moment, because the Ngo Dinh
                    Diem regime had decided to try and surgically eliminate the Buddhist problem, I
                    think on the night of August 21, and they invaded the pagodas in the Saigon area
                    and rounded up several of the activist Buddhist bonzes who were sort of leading
                    the demonstrations. And Lodge arrived at a very tense moment. The American press
                    was out in force to cover his arrival. The obvious question asked was, “What do
                    you intend to do about this terrible thing that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime has
                    done to attempt to liquidate the Buddhist threat?”</p>
                <p>He brought with him two advisors or two aides. One was Herbert W. Blot, who had
                    previously worked for CIA. He was more or less a political advisor to Lodge. The
                    other advisor was a colonel who Lodge had met at the Pentagon named John N.
                    Dunn, US Army. And these two people, certainly in the early weeks that Lodge was
                    there, became, in effect, his eyes and ears and conduits to both the US military
                    establishment in Saigon and to the mission itself, the embassy political
                    section.</p>
                <p>The economic section was AID. Mike Dunn, who was a friend of mine, has been over
                    the years, I didn't know him all that well at that time of his arrival, but he
                    was a very intelligent officer, got a Ph.D. from Woodrow Wilson School in
                    political science and very active individual, a very effective aide to Lodge and
                    was able to do everything Lodge asked of him. And that is the way the Lodge
                    embassy worked, really, through those two conduits.</p>
                <p>I'd say eventually, over a matter of weeks, possibly a couple of months, Dunn
                    became the important member [unclear]. And he was the one that the ambassador
                    depended on most heavily to keep the mission functioning and make sure that he,
                    the ambassador, was being informed about everything that was going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is often a problem when you have put a military man
                        in because of the training, which is, “What does the ambassador want? I'll
                        see that it's done.” I mean, we've just recently had a case of Lieutenant
                        Colonel Oliver North causing a lot of trouble in the name of our government.
                        But I mean, there is a military mind set, no matter how intelligent. They're
                        trained to see the objective and not often see the repercussions
                        particularly in a political environment. Do you think this might have been a
                        problem here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I don't think it was a problem. Your question is a little more—I can
                    understand what you're saying. In terms of the personalities involved, Mike Dunn
                    is a very subtle individual as well as being intelligent in the military
                    individual and coming from his background. I do know on the basis of my own
                    experience with him that he was every bit as tough on the US military side even
                    in Saigon as he was in the embassy. In fact, I know from a couple of my military
                    friends, they said more than once, “Wait till we get Dunn back in the Army!”
                    However, he was able to get back into the Army and eventually made major general
                    before he retired.</p>
                <p>But in any event, he was out there, and I think he served Lodge faithfully and
                    did everything Lodge wanted done. And the same time, I think he was subtle
                    enough to provide a cushion between Lodge and the mission. Now, I do feel that
                    Lodge arrived, he knew nobody as far as he had never served with any of the
                    members of the staff, the diplomatic members or the Foreign Service members of
                    the embassy staff. I think he was suspicious, one, as to why he had been
                    appointed. Two, he didn't know the members of the staff. Three, he knew he was
                    moving into a very, very dicey situation in terms of the relationship with the
                    Ngo Dinh Diem regime and what he understand Washington to want.</p>
                <p>So I think he was very suspicious throughout that entire period in that he did
                    not accept a great deal of advice that might come to him directly from the
                    embassy staff or from any other source within the mission. I think he was
                    extremely cautious, kept his counsel with a very narrow circle almost consisting
                    entirely of Dunn and Blot. And over time, I think he began to appreciate the
                    quality of the people on the staff, but it took a while. And I'd say it wasn't
                    until the overthrow, the coup of November, 1963, that he had begun to get to the
                    point where he was willing to accept advice from counsel directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, from your vantage point, how did the November 1963
                        coup play out as you saw it, and what were the feelings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BURKE: Well, the rumors were rife in late August that a coup was in the works,
                    something was going to happen in the very near term. Most reporters felt this. I
                    should say this just in passing, but Cabot Lodge made a great effort to butter
                    up the American correspondents on the scene. Almost from the moment of his
                    arrival, he was accessible to them, and I think his press was extremely
                    favorable throughout this period. I think he saw them individually. He gave
                    individual background interviews to some of the more prominent members of the
                    press corps, which was fairly sizeable even then. And I think it played very
                    well back here.</p>
                <p>As to the coup, how it played out. Late August the rumors were rife that it was
                    going to happen very soon. And then the rumors began to die down. Elections were
                    held in September for the National Assembly successfully. A new National
                    Assembly was established. The government began to give the impression that they
                    were on top of the situation. And things were very quiet throughout most of
                    October. In fact, many of the journalists said to me they were a little
                    irritated because nothing was going on. And I can't remember precisely what, but
                    there was some sort of a story that was brewing in Djakarta and many of them got
                    orders from their home offices to go down to Djakarta and cover that, possibly
                    find other things to report because things were so superficially quiet in
                    Saigon.</p>
                <p>And National Day, which was, I think, October 26, Ngo Dinh Diem came. A parade
                    was held. Diem was out taking salutes of the troops. The crowd was reasonably
                    responsive to him. So things had quieted down, and then, of course, the rumors
                    began to circulate, things would begin at the end of the month. Then the coup
                    erupted. I was not personally aware of the relationship which was later revealed
                    between Lieutenant Colonel Lucien Conein and the coup group headed by General
                    Tran Van Don, “Big Minh,” and Kim. But that's been pretty well documented.</p>
                <p>So the coup itself, the involvement of the embassy, has been pretty well
                    documented in various books that appeared—Helen Hammer's book, Death in
                    November, General Tran Van Don's book called Our Endless War. But there are
                    several other books. And there appears to have been a very close contact between
                    Conein, who was an old Indochina hand, who had been in North Vietnam right after
                    World War II and then later on at the time the French were pulling out. He had
                    many friends among the general group that became known as the “Captain's Majors”
                    and whatnot of the past. But from my perspective at the moment—I was certainly
                    was not privy to any of this—I rather doubt that the legal counsel or his deputy
                    were privy to it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you feel about it? I mean, what was sort of
                        the feeling within the political section when the word came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BURKE: Well, there was elation on the part of a few people who had argued in
                    favor of doing something to “get this government moving or replace this
                    government.” I'm afraid that I was rather cynical about the whole affair because
                    I—and this was the position I took at the time in conversations with my
                    colleagues—I felt that unless you knew precisely what was going to follow, there
                    was not much point in replacing a government that had been, for all of its
                    faults, functioning reasonably well and that had claim to a mandate.</p>
                <p>One might argue that Ngo Dinh Diem's election as president of South Vietnam was
                    clouded to a certain extent. Nevertheless, he had been in power for a
                    considerable number of years. He had weathered other crises in that time. And he
                    seemed, certainly on the face of it, a leader who had the best interests of his
                    country at heart, and in point of fact, he was almost incorruptible. After the
                    overthrow, the Military Revolutionary Council, a group of generals who lead the
                    coup, made a great attempt to try and document evidence that the Diem regime had
                    squirreled money away abroad in Swiss bank accounts and all the rest, and they
                    were unable to find any.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this point, had you made any contacts using your
                        Vietnamese in Vietnamese ruling circles even at any level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Certainly not within the ruling circle as such. I had several contacts at
                    the—oh, let's say, the office director level within administrative foreign
                    affairs, within the state interior, knew a lot of Vietnamese business people,
                    and met socially many Vietnamese who were connected with the government, and
                    many people who had no connection whatever, a couple of doctors and some
                    lawyers, people of that stripe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they view the situation after the coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: After the coup? There was a tendency on the part of almost everybody to
                    say, “It's a wonderful thing!” There were a few people who, in quiet
                    conversation, would express certain misgivings, what they could expect now in
                    terms of their leadership. But generally the reaction was, “This is wonderful!
                    Now we can get ahead and go through the problems and have a government of
                    national union and prosecute the war against the communist insurgence without
                    distractions, this Buddhist crisis.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until '67. And how were things? Was there a
                        change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: No. I'd say the bloom went off the rose on January 30, 1964, three months
                    after the coup, when General Khanh mounted his what was been described as his
                    counter-coup, and it locked up the generals who had led the first coup
                    incidents.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I and several others had argued that once you had a coup and you got involved in
                    a coup, the one great risk is you had to beware of is the possibility is that
                    one coup would bring about yet another coup. So over the next two years,
                    roughly—well, November 1, 1963 to mid-1965—you had a succession of probably 11
                    coups and coup manqu�s, and every one of them brought about a certain change in
                    government.</p>
                <p>The real problem here just from a managerial point of view, it seems to me, is
                    that—let's say that if you were a firm that rates the efficiency of an
                    institution, and you say that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is 40% efficient, and you
                    look at it two years later, and you find that you've changed province chiefs,
                    maybe, six or eight times in every province, you've replaced directors general
                    in all the ministries, you replaced ministers in all ministries, and just for
                    arguments sake you've lost 5% efficiency every time you have a change, by
                    mid-1965 in terms of governmental efficiency, they're probably scraping on
                    zero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I'm hoping that we will have a series of
                        interviews devoted strictly to Vietnam. So I'm moving ahead rather rapidly.
                        But I would like you to talk about Maxwell Taylor. General Maxwell Taylor
                        came in and was the ambassador for a period of about a year. Lodge only
                        lasted about a year, and then he came back again. As far as the embassy is
                        concerned, what did he tell you before he left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I got to know the ambassador quite well before he left in early '62. I did
                    a lot of note- taking for him in interviews that he had with political leaders.
                    I should say, he was almost four-by-four or five-by-five in French. His French
                    was excellent. He certainly needed no interpretation. But he conducted almost
                    all of his meetings with the Vietnamese in French.</p>
                <p>Lodge told me the day that he announced his departure—we were going off to a
                    meeting, and it was just the two of us in the car. And you may remember that in
                    early 1964 with the coming political conventions to choose a presidential
                    candidate in the United States, Lodge began to develop, without even being
                    present, a certain ground swell of interest in various places. In fact, I think
                    he even won a couple of primaries, political primaries, along the way—the
                    primary in Oregon and one or two other places—and ran extremely well.</p>
                <p>So the major contender, of course, was Senator Goldwater. And Lodge was, in
                    political terms, diametrically opposed to Goldwater. And he said to me in the
                    car that morning, “John, I'm going back. I feel that I have to stop this man in
                    his effort to gain or make the Republican nomination. I feel it would be a great
                    mistake in the party if he is nominated.” And he said, “I really don't expect
                    that I have a chance, but the fact that I have run reasonably well in some of
                    these primaries that I didn't even campaign in, I'm going back to try and see
                    whether I can work the nomination for someone else.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when Taylor came in, was there a change in the
                        atmosphere of the embassy, how you operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Taylor, of course, brought in a new team. The principal team was, of
                    course, himself; Alex Johnson, with whom I'd served in Bangkok; and William H.
                    Sullivan, who came in as mission coordinator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both these were skilled people in the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lodge came in with people who worked as—well, they were
                        knowledgeable, but they weren't as knowledgeable in sort of, you might say,
                        embassy terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: They created, of course, the post, I think it's the one and only time in
                    diplomatic practice in the world which you had a deputy ambassador. They created
                    that job for Alex Johnson. But you had, I'd say, a very smoothly functioning
                    embassy under these three people. Bill Sullivan was there just for six months,
                    and it was understood that he was going to Vientiane as ambassador. He serviced
                    as mission coordinator for the first six months for Taylor.</p>
                <p>General Taylor I hadn't known prior to this, but I got to know him extremely
                    well, too, and did a lot of note-taking for him during his mission. I've got the
                    highest respect for him as an individual. He's really a remarkable, disciplined
                    individual in terms of, not military terms, but in terms of the way he conducted
                    himself. He has an extremely good mind, a marvelous thinker. He had Japanese, of
                    course. He had German. He had French. I think he had one or two other languages
                    as well. Curiously enough, he spoke excellent French but he had an American
                    accent, so not as good as one might have hoped. But certainly his vocabulary and
                    knowledge of the language [unclear].I'd say the embassy functioned extremely
                    well. But he arrived in mid- 1964. He had Nguyen Khanh as the prime minister.
                    Khanh had overthrown a coup group in January of that year. Khanh was already
                    running into trouble from Buddhists and northern Catholics, who were at least
                    aware that a sizable group of Vietnamese would come south after the French had
                    withdrawn and were withdrawing and settled in the Saigon area on lands furnished
                    by Ngo Dinh Diem.</p>
                <p>Let's see, there's one point I wanted to make in connection with that. Taylor, of
                    course, knew Vietnam because he had worked on the Vietnam problem for a long
                    time in Washington. He had made several trips to Saigon with Robert McNamara.
                    And as he had been Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Special Assistant to the
                    President, so he had very close ties with the Kennedy family, with President
                    Kennedy and his brother, Robert.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at that point, how did you feel in the embassy? Did
                        you feel that you were sort of on a roller coaster of which you had no
                        control? Or were we trying to have some sort of control over events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, again, I think given the many changes in government by coup or coup
                    manqu�s, we were at a serious disadvantage in trying to develop contacts. When
                    the first coup group came in, the first military revolutionary council, they put
                    together a group of civilians, and they named it the Conseil des Notables, the
                    council of notables. And the idea was that this appointed group was to function
                    as a legislature of sorts.</p>
                <p>Now, there were some very interesting political figures in the Conseil des
                    Notables. You had people who were members of the Die Viet Party, the members of
                    the VNQDD Party. It was a very interesting group, and many of them had been out
                    of the country during the last years of the Diem regime and had just come back,
                    and the embassy didn't know many of them.</p>
                <p>So when the Conseil was formed, I said to Mel one day, I said, “Look, why in the
                    world don't we get Cabot Lodge to have a reception, at least?” I said, “We
                    really don't know them well. We have a few contacts with some of them. But we
                    almost are out of touch with this group.” So he tried the idea out on Lodge.
                    Lodge agreed to it.</p>
                <p>I was pressed into service as protocol officer. I organized the reception. And we
                    had it at Lodge's residence. It went over extremely well. The political section
                    was there en masse with some other officers from the embassy. And after the
                    party, we made a massive effort through MEMCONS, with every conversation and
                    whatnot, and put them all together and really put together the best “book,” so
                    called, on political personalities that began to play roles in Saigon.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the Conseil des Notables went out of business on January 30. But
                    many of these same people began to resurface as political figures in these other
                    mutations and transformations in government that we had later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you are pointing to a difficulty that often is
                        overlooked by people who look at the work of a foreign service, and that is,
                        often when a coup takes over, I mean, basically we don't sit back there and
                        have a line on everybody in the country. And when a new group takes over,
                        this often cuts out all the contacts that we have been getting. And
                        particularly when a military coup takes over, I mean, just by its very
                        nature, usually embassies don't have much to do with lieutenant colonels and
                        the like. So that in a fast-moving situation, an embassy can find itself
                        badly crippled as far as gathering intelligence in any country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. And a coup oftentimes wipes out an embassy's entire group of
                    contacts, and you're faced with a whole new set of faces.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again, I'm pressing ahead. I hope we'll come back on
                        another occasion. But you came back in 1967, and you were working both as
                        the director of the Vietnam Working Group and the country director for
                        Vietnam. This is for two years, wasn't this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: No. First of all, I served for 12 months as Bill Bundy's special
                    assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. You say you were working for William Bundy.
                        Could you describe his operating style, what you were doing for him,
                        please?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. Well, as special assistant, I was the coordinator, if you will, for
                    the East Asian Bureau in terms of keeping the paper moving from the political
                    desks of the various offices within the Bureau up through Bundy to the seventh
                    floor or up to Bundy for his decision or for his action. I worked closely with
                    the country directors at the time, and certainly worked very closely with Bundy
                    on a six- or seven-day-per-week basis, because it was a very critical time, and
                    I'd say Bundy was in the office for 10 to 12 hours a day every day.</p>
                <p>I had very little substantive input in terms of paper coming up from the
                    political desks except in the case of Vietnam. And I would participate in
                    substantive discussions on Vietnam with Bundy and with the then country
                    director, Robert Miller, who had been in Saigon with me. Then when Bob left to
                    go to the Empirical Defense College, Bundy asked me if I would take over as
                    director of the Vietnam Working Group, which was the Vietnam directorate at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>You asked about Bundy's operating style. Bundy is one of the most brilliant
                    people I've ever worked with. He and his brother, of course, are both—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Bundy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: George Bundy. Both playing key roles at the time, and he's very hard on
                    himself and very hard on the people working for him. He was under extreme
                    pressure, but he certainly asked as much of himself as he asked of others. He
                    did not tolerate sloppy work. He did not tolerate missed deadlines. He was
                    constantly in consultation with Secretary Rusk and with other high officers of
                    the Department in terms, particularly, of the Vietnam problem. But there were
                    many other things going on in East Asian affairs at the time which required his
                    attention as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>So he, I'd say, set a very high standard for the Bureau and for himself and for
                    the people who worked for him. The people who were not up to the mark he had
                    replaced from time to time. But that goes with the turf, and when you're doing
                    important work, you've got to get the work done as quickly as possible and as
                    effectively as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that time you were working for him and later when you
                        were the country director of—what was it? Country director for Vietnamese
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, the official title in those days was the Vietnam Working Group, and
                    the director of the Vietnam Working Group was, in effect, the director of the
                    Office of Vietnam Affairs. A Vietnam task force had been established back in the
                    Kennedy years, and this evolved into and became the Vietnam Working Group. So
                    it's a rather curious title, but that was the title that was used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it boils down to you were the country officer
                        for—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: For Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, these are obviously crucial years, '68-'69. What did
                        you as the director for Vietnam do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, there was a lot of coordination with other elements of the executive
                    branch that were involved in Vietnam, for example, AID and the aid program, the
                    Pentagon. We were moving to establish the Paris talks and enter into
                    negotiations with Hanoi and looking toward a settlement. We had the Tet
                    Offensive that erupted in late January of 1968. So it was the whole panoply of
                    day-to-day sort of crisis management, if you will.</p>
                <p>But in the longer term, what we were attempting to do was assist—well, achieve a
                    series of decisions which would enable our embassy in Saigon to assist the
                    government to become stronger—well, the Saigon government, the government of
                    South Vietnam—at the same time, to bring about the commencement of these talks,
                    looking toward some sort of a political settlement with Hanoi and to keep the
                    whole thing together. Obviously, any move on our part in terms of negotiating
                    with Hanoi was bound to put new strains on the government of South Vietnam. So
                    there was a great deal of balancing that went on.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Bundy, in those days, used to chair a group which was referred to as the “Eleven
                    O'clock Group,” and this consisted of myself; George Carver of CIA, who ran the
                    Vietnam office at CIA; Les Kalb, who was over at Defense; Mortimer Halperin, who
                    was also over at Defense; and we would have a military officer sometimes,
                    somebody like Bill DuPree or General George Signias as a member of this “Eleven
                    O'clock Group.”</p>
                <p>It really was not a decision-making body as such, but it was an effort to keep
                    all the elements of the executive branch informed as to what was going on. It
                    was, in effect, a staff meeting, if you will, under Bundy's chairmanship, but
                    just to make certain that all the agencies and departments with important
                    interests in Vietnam knew what was going on, were informing the others about
                    projects that they might be contemplating or working on, and just generally to
                    review the situation that had happened overnight in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your attitude towards this evolving thing? Were
                        you, as with the others, so involved in almost day-to-day affairs that it
                        was hard to haul back and say, “Should we be here? Are we winning? Are we
                        losing?” How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I felt, at the time, that the situation was such that we had a reasonable
                    chance of succeeding in Vietnam in terms of—by that, I mean, arriving at a
                    situation where the government of South Vietnam would be able to stand on its
                    own feet at a time when US forces were withdrawn, and that some sort of an
                    accommodation with Hanoi could be worked out. I was personally convinced that
                    the accommodation wouldn't work or couldn't be arrived at with Hanoi unless they
                    were convinced that a full-scale win in the South was impossible to them and the
                    cost was too high. But I felt in this time frame, '67, '68, '69, there was still
                    hope that this could be achieved.</p>
                <p>Obviously, the Tet Offensive was a great setback to us psychologically in the
                    United States, although I knew almost immediately from the reports coming in
                    that militarily it had been a terrible defeat for the North, that they had tried
                    to ferment this nationwide uprising in the South, and it had failed, that they
                    had lost a lot of their cadre as a result of this gamble on their part. But
                    psychologically in terms of the reporting that was coming out of Saigon by the
                    media, by the US media, and the way it was played back in the United States,
                    particularly the occupation of the embassy compound for a brief period, the
                    occupation of Hue for a longer period, attacks carried out within Saigon itself,
                    it was a psychologically serious blow and probably an almost fatal blow in terms
                    of our effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how much did you and those working with you feel the
                        pressures from outside, from Congress, from the press and all? I mean, did
                        this have an effect on your thinking or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BURKE: Well, it obviously had an effect on us. It didn't have an effect, I would
                    say, generally, on our thinking and what we felt was possible. But we had to
                    deal with it. We had to deal with the Congress. The main brunt of testifying for
                    the Congress was born by Bundy himself, although on occasion I did testify at
                    the subcommittee level in support of an aid program for Vietnam, that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>We were getting, though, constant pressure from individual congressmen and also
                    from the reporters on the scene and also from interest groups within the United
                    States who would come to Washington and wanted to be briefed on Vietnam, many
                    groups which were, in effect, opposed to our continued involvement in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling—if you can try and go back to the
                        time that the clock was ticking as far as what we could do—maybe because,
                        you know, we just couldn't keep up the public support for much longer, did
                        you feel this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, there was no question but it appeared that the public support was
                    ebbing. And when President Johnson, in his March 31st speech in 1968, chose to
                    withdraw from the election of 1968 and devote his time, what was left of his
                    term, to try and seek a settlement of the Vietnam War and engage Hanoi in
                    meaningful talks, this was obviously in response to his perception of public
                    opinion and public support.</p>
                <p>Also, of course, the constant barrage of reporting of demonstrations, especially
                    at the Chicago convention, the campaign of Robert Kennedy, which was essentially
                    an anti-war campaign that he was waging, the Democratic Convention in Chicago,
                    all of this, it was quite obviously that the “peace group” in the United States
                    was becoming stronger and more vocal. I do and did feel at the time there was
                    still a fairly large residue of support in the United States, if only that
                    element of the populace could be convinced that the situation was winnable or we
                    could achieve our objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was this talk about, “Well, if we only have 50,000
                        more troops and then another 50,000 and so on, we could do it.” And the
                        number grew to be half a million. How did we view the American military
                        role? Again, I'm speaking from the State Department at the working
                        level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Certainly during my time, I was not conscious of any sharp division
                    between ourselves and the Pentagon. Obviously, the commanders in the field are
                    the ones responsible for the success of operations, and if they felt they needed
                    more troops, then they went out to be given more resources. Certainly, we, the
                    US Government starting with the President and others—I should mention the
                    Tuesday Lunch. In this period, there was a command body, if you will, at the
                    White House, which was known as the Tuesday Lunch. And this consisted of the
                    President, Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara, Walt Rostow and occasionally one or two
                    others.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>And in order to get decisions taken at the highest level regarding Vietnam, what
                    you did was get it discussed and decided at the Tuesday lunch, because you had
                    the key players right there. So whenever we had something that we wanted a
                    decision on, it was a very—actually, it was a very efficient mechanism in many
                    ways, and much more efficient than doing a 40-page memorandum with attachments,
                    which would go up through the machinery of the Department to the sixth and
                    seventh floor, then go over to the White House and eventually be chopped off by,
                    first of all, the NSC advisor and the President. But very quickly, you could get
                    a piece of paper up to the Secretary, and he could introduce the subject at the
                    Tuesday lunch and get a decision on it in a matter of 24 or 48 hours. But this
                    group, of course, looked very carefully at propositions being made by the
                    military regarding bombing, extent of bombing attacks against the North. And
                    targets were approved at this level.</p>
                <p>It didn't make—and this is a personal view, obviously—it didn't make a lot of
                    sense to me, a former naval officer who had served in not only World War II but
                    I was recalled for Korea and served three years there. But it seemed that the
                    restrictions that we were placing on the military, especially in terms of
                    actions against the North once we had decided to bomb the North, were much too
                    restrictive. I also personally felt that it was a terrible blunder on our part
                    not to have mined Haiphong harbor. I argued with Bundy in favor of mining early
                    on—by early on I'm talking '67-'68—but for one reason or another, it was
                    concluded that it was too dangerous in terms of risks of damage to Chinese,
                    Russian or third country shipping of one sort or another.</p>
                <p>That decision is, just by-the-by, I think it was a mistake, because essentially
                    mining is one of the most humane things you can do. You say, “As of 12:00
                    tomorrow, shipping goes in or out of that port at its own peril, because the
                    mines are there.” So anybody who moves runs the risk of running into a mine. It
                    isn't like bombing. Actually, you can give fair warning, and as long as the
                    shipping does not move, there's no danger to any vessel.</p>
                <p>But I do feel that the civilian side did put heavy restrictions on the military
                    and what it was able to do. In retrospect, I think it was pretty obvious that
                    there was a great deal of concern that they got too close to the Chinese border.
                    You ran the risk that we ran into in the Korean War and that the Chinese would
                    enter.</p>

                    terrorism as far as diplomacy is concerned. I've been involved in a couple of
                    those, and it's always a mistake to try and handle the next kidnapping in a way
                    that the previous one was handled if you handled it successfully.</p>

                        year, and then you went as a deputy chief of mission to Port-au-Prince,
                        Haiti where you served for two years from '70 to '72. What was the situation
                        in Haiti as you arrived there, and what were American interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I should say that this is one of the few posts that I've actually
                    tried to get in the Foreign Service and made an active effort to get the post.
                    When I was finishing—well, I was in the War College. I did talk to people in ARA
                    and said that I had an interest in going as DCM in Haiti. My interest stemmed
                    from the fact that I've always been interested in Haitian history and the
                    remarkable fact that it is, after all, the second republic in the Western
                    Hemisphere and that the Haitians were able to drive out Napoleon's army in 1804
                    and been independent off and on ever since.</p>
                <p>I had been intrigued by Duvalier and the role he was playing and the general
                    reputation he had. I felt that he probably wasn't going to be around all that
                    much longer, and it seemed to me that it might be an interesting time to be in
                    Haiti, especially if he were to expire and be succeeded by another regime.
                    Because as of that moment, nobody knew what would succeed or who would succeed
                    the Duvalier government.</p>
                <p>The situation prevailing when I arrived—you may recall that the relationship with
                    the United States was very tense between Haiti and the United States starting
                    roughly in '61-'62, and I'd say it bottomed out, if you will, in around '64-'65.
                    Our ambassador was PNGed at one stage. We had cut off foreign assistance to this
                    country, and our embassy was down to a very small size. The Haitians, the
                    Haitian government, was almost destitute in terms of resources or income or
                    whatever. But it was just getting slightly better toward the end of the 1960s.
                    Duvalier had survived a couple of coup attempts, and there was some
                    manufacturing outfits from the United States beginning to move in a very small
                    scale.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>But generally, I'd say, the relationship between the embassy and the government
                    of Haiti when I arrived was reasonably good, although there was still tight
                    control by the palace over contacts between Haitian officialdom and the U.S.
                    Embassy. We were received at the various ministries, but the Haitian officials
                    were inhibited from accepting social invitations and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could they make decisions? I mean, did you find the
                        officials there an effective group, or did it all have to be done by
                        Duvalier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Oh, I think the palace had a control over the decision-making machinery.
                    But you did have certain officials in the government who were reasonably
                    effective. Several of the ministers, I'd say, were extremely well trained. Many
                    had been trained in the United States or France. And they were highly
                    intelligent individuals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe a bit about the embassy, how you viewed
                        the staff there and also the operating style of the ambassador? Was it
                        Clinton Knox who was a career officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I'd never met Ambassador Knox before my arrival in Haiti, as a matter of
                    fact. We had exchanged letters after my assignment, and I knew a fair amount
                    about him. He had been in the OSS during the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Office of Strategic Services.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes, as an enlisted man. He was black, had gone to Williams College,
                    gotten a Ph.D. in history from Harvard in 1939, and studied abroad in France,
                    and worked under William Langer at Harvard—he was his major professor working
                    for the doctorate—a very interesting individual, a very intelligent man. I, as I
                    say, didn't know him before my arrival. We developed a relationship, which I
                    think became a very warm relationship, and he treated me very well.</p>
                <p>It took a while for me to gain his confidence, as was to be expected. I think any
                    DCM going into an embassy has to earn the confidence of his chief of mission and
                    has to adapt himself to the operating style of the ambassador. But once I gained
                    his confidence, he gave me pretty much a free hand of running the embassy as
                    long as I was careful to keep him informed about everything that was going on.
                    But he had a very easy hands-off style as long as he was kept informed.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>He was able to develop—between the two of us, we decided that, after all Haiti
                    was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere—still is, for that matter—but
                    a modest aid program certainly seemed the proper way to go in terms of trying to
                    rehabilitate the relationship with Haiti. After all, we had occupied Haiti from
                    1915 to 1934 and run the country for all intents and purposes—”we,” the U.S. And
                    this was of interest and somewhat of a surprise to me. There was a great residue
                    of—I'd say affection may be too strong a word, but liking for Americans in
                    Haiti. It was something, it seemed to me, that we could build on, and it might
                    stand us in good stead after President Duvalier shuffled off his mortal call or
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>So we pushed for this very modest aid program. I think we asked for $70,000 a
                    year—the ambassador's fund, really. But it was a fund that we could use with a
                    fair amount of local control over what it was given for. And these were
                    self-help projects, many of them, and $70,000 went a long way in a country like
                    Haiti. So it was good seed money. And later on, of course, we were able to get
                    AID to send an AID officer in and the government could begin to submit aid
                    projects. And it developed, I think, in a very favorable way.</p>
                <p>Duvalier did die not too long after I arrived. I think it was nine months after I
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He died, I think, on April 21, 1971.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. So I had been there just about nine, ten months. And in the meantime,
                    of course, he obviously knew he was quite ill. He, after all, was an M.D.
                    himself and probably could estimate his own condition as well as any of his
                    doctors. So he, surprisingly enough to us, pushed through a referendum in
                    February, I think, of 1971, which established his son, Jean-Claude Duvalier as
                    his designated heir and successor to follow the father.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, through a series of devices, Ambassador Knox had gotten to know
                    Duvalier. Through a series of devices and initiatives, really, we were able to
                    establish not a friendship, but a relationship between Duvalier P�re and
                    Ambassador Knox. We had, for example, the moon rock at that time, and it came
                    through when we were able to get an appointment with the President to show him
                    the moon rock, and he was intrigued with the idea.</p>
                <p>Then we were able to convince Charlie Meyer, who is then the assistant secretary
                    for Latin America, to include Haiti during the course of a swing that he was
                    making through Latin America. It was the first time that anybody of that rank
                    had visited Haiti in probably close to a decade. And in conjunction with the
                    Meyer visit, Ambassador Knox had a sit-down dinner—I think for about 50
                    people—and we were able to get almost everybody of any consequence in the
                    Haitian government to attend. Now, this did not include President Duvalier, but
                    every one of his ministers was there including people who had never been seen
                    socially by the embassy staff in any situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>So these series of moves and initiatives, I think, did serve us well in April
                    1971 when Duvalier died. And, in fact, I got a call late that evening from
                    Ambassador Knox, who said he had at 10:00 suddenly been summoned to the palace,
                    and he had asked whether or not he couldn't bring me with him. And the foreign
                    minister had agreed. So the two of us went down to the palace, and he was
                    speculating—I drove my personal car, and the ambassador and I went in my
                    personal car—speculating as to what was likely to come up during this session.
                    He was a little apprehensive being summoned to the palace at this late hour. He
                    was wondering if something had developed in terms of the relationship and he was
                    going to be PNGed or what.</p>
                <p>But in any event, I suggested to him that perhaps we were being invited down to
                    say adieu to Duvalier P�re. And, in fact, when we arrived at the palace, the
                    foreign minister announced to us that the president had died, and that his son
                    was being sworn in that very evening as the new president of Haiti. And we were
                    the only non-Haitians in the palace the night Jean-Claude was sworn in as
                    president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get involved in anything, you and the
                        ambassador, trying to ameliorate the rule of Duvalier's, say, regarding
                        political prisoners or this type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, in 1970, things domestically had calmed down to a large extent. When
                    I arrived, there were probably about 16 or 17 people living in asylum in various
                    embassies in Port-au-Prince, in Latin American embassies, because the standard
                    practice in Latin America is for Latin American embassies to accept asylees
                    until such time as they can be given safe passage out of the country. I think
                    there's a feeling on the part of some that if they do it for somebody, maybe
                    when their time comes, they'll be given similar hospitality.</p>
                <p>But as far as the internal political situation was concerned, it had calmed down
                    to a large extent, and there was a slight bloom of prosperity on the economy.
                    The government was participating in activities of the United Nations and the OAS
                    and welcoming various foreign groups down, and they were attempting to put their
                    best foot forward. So the obvious oppressive atmosphere that had persisted or
                    existed during the period '62, '63, '64 had shifted somewhat, and the Duvalier
                    regime was really installed. And even though there had been an aborted coup
                    attempt by some Coast Guard officers in early 1970 before my arrival, the
                    reaction to that coup effort was not as violent and suppressive as previous
                    efforts had produced. So the atmosphere seemed better.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Now, obviously in our conversations with Haitian officials, we stressed the
                    importance that Haiti begin to play a more—what do I want to say—not responsible
                    role, but take its place in the community of the Western Hemisphere, and that
                    aid was necessary and the only way that you could assure that Haiti would likely
                    get aid either from the international lending organizations or banks or
                    governments was to have a climate of investment, and you weren't going to have
                    such a climate of investment if people were getting shot and dragged off to
                    prison and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Now, how much influence we might have had, I think the tide was moving in that
                    direction anyway. Then when Duvalier P�re died, the father died, and Jean-Claude
                    took over, he had a small coterie of ministers who were—after all, he was only
                    19 or just barely 20 at the time—coterie of ministers who were advising him. And
                    these were the younger group of ministers who were, say, a generation down from
                    the people in the earlier period when Duvalier first came to power in '57—people
                    like Andre Ramone, who became Minister of Foreign Affairs; Whitner Cambron. who
                    was Minister of Interior; and Fitz Cenias, who was Minister of Information.</p>
                <p>Now, some of them had better reputations than others, but all three appreciated
                    the importance of Haiti and especially Jean-Claude projecting a more reasonable
                    image than had been the case previously, and that's what they set out to try and
                    do. And I think that they were modestly successful and that Jean-Claude in his
                    first months and years, really, as president did project such an image, and
                    foreign assistance began to flow into Haiti at rather remarkable rates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about immigration from Haiti to the United States? Was
                        this a concern or was it kept under pretty good control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, immigration was a condiderable problem, because every Haitian, like
                    every Jamaican, like every Trinidadian, like every Guyanese, probably in their
                    heart of hearts would like to come to the United States. And, of course, because
                    of Haiti's international reputation, which was not the best, when some Haitians
                    would try illegally to pile into a boat and make their way to the Flordia coast,
                    they were oftentimes represented as political asylees. Quite honestly, I think
                    that in most cases they weren't. They were economic refugees, if you will, given
                    the fact that on one-third of the island of Hispaniola you have roughly six
                    million people. So the arable land is extremely limited. Its mountainous. It's
                    eroding because of deforestation. And the prospects for any Haitian are rather
                    limited. And if you can get to the United States, maybe you can get a job doing
                    something. So that they were economic refugees, but almost none were really
                    political refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were so reporting in—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BURKE: Well, we had one case where one of these boats got as far as Guantanamo
                    Bay. I think there were something like 60 or 70 on board. And we had a three-way
                    negotiation between Guantanamo, Washington, and Port-au-Prince as to what we
                    should do with them. And we went to the government, and we said, “Look, these
                    people on the basis of the interrogation they've undergone in Guantanamo, it
                    does appear that these people really were attempting to enter the U.S.
                    illegally. Now, we would like to bring them back, and the Navy would like to get
                    rid of them. But we want assurances that they will not be oppressed in any way
                    for having attempted to leave the country illegally. I mean, we certainly don't
                    want them thrown into prison. Can we get that sort of a guarantee from you”</p>
                <p>They're flown back. Their boat was a wreck. As they were flown back from
                    Guantanamo and to the airport, they came into the airport, we had the prior
                    assurances of the government that they would not be maltreated or mistreated for
                    having attempted to leave the country without visas, and we checked up on them
                    for some months thereafter to make sure that this was, indeed, the case. And on
                    the basis of that experience, we were even more convinced than ever that so many
                    of these who did make it to Florida and, of course, did claim political asylum
                    were probably economic refugees in almost every case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you mention a time limitation here, I think we'll
                        make another jump, if you don't mind. You were in Caribbean Affairs from
                        1972 to '75. Then you were at the Senior Seminar, the Department of State's
                        equivalent to War College, from '75 to '76. And you were the deputy chief of
                        mission in Bangkok from '76 to '77. And I hope we can come back to some of
                        these others. But since this is focused on your—these interviews of people
                        who were ambassadors, I'd like to ask how you became appointed to be
                        ambassador to Guyana. This is in 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I had, obviously like every good FSO had, hopes of becoming
                    ambassador one day. I thought it was reasonable to assume, given the fact that I
                    had such extensive Caribbean experience, that I might certainly be qualified to
                    serve as ambassador somewhere in the Caribbean. When the Carter Administration
                    came in, this panel was established, you may recall, which Averell Harriman and
                    certain other people served to get ambassadorial appointments and look over the
                    list of potential candidates for embassies.</p>
                <p>I received a telegram from the Department asking me if I would agree to be
                    nominated as ambassador to Jamaica, and I was pleased at that. I sent back an
                    immediate affirmative cable, and roughly ten days later I got a cable from the
                    Department saying, “Sorry, but Jamaica is obligated. Would you agree to your
                    nomination as ambassador to the Cooperative Republic of Guyana?” I knew Guyana,
                    of course, from my days as director of Caribbean Affairs, but I would have been
                    much more interested in Kingston, Jamaica. However, I agreed to go as ambassador
                    to Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there in 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe what was the situation? First, what
                        were American interests in Guyana, and then what was the situation as you
                        saw it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, the situation in Guyana was a bit strained. The Ford Administration
                    had nominated a man to be ambassador to Georgetown who is a political appointee.
                    He was a labor leader. This would have been in the last days of the Ford
                    Administration. The man was never confirmed. So we had a charg� there for a
                    considerable period. And I think that the post had been vacant for the better
                    part of 18 months when I arrived.</p>
                <p>Of course, our governmental interest in Guyana—goes back a considerable period.
                    It goes back into the early 1960s in the Kennedy Administration. You may recall,
                    before independence, there was a good deal of concern that Cheddi Jagan would
                    become the first prime minister of an independent Guyana, and he was, actually,
                    had been elected premier of Guyana, which was still part of the British
                    Commonwealth. And independence was scheduled. Both Washington and London were
                    somewhat apprehensive, of course. This was after Castro and Cuba and all the
                    rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what was the problem with Jagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, the problem was that Jagan was a devout Marxist, and were he to
                    become prime minister of an independent Guyana, it was understood because he
                    made no bones about the fact that his allegiance was to Moscow, and that he was
                    a doctrinaire communist and that he would create what would be a communist state
                    on the mainland of Latin America. There was, as I say, considerable interest in
                    the Kennedy Administration to do what they could to make sure that this didn't
                    happen. And the British government was somewhat apprehensive as well, less so
                    than we were.</p>
                <p>In any event, between the time Jagan was premier and before independence, there
                    was an effort domestically within Guyana to put together a political coalition
                    of blacks and the other ethnic elements within the country. I should say that
                    the ethnic majority in Guyana is East Indian, and Jagan, of course, is East
                    Indian. And the East Indians, of course, many of whom had no interest in
                    communism, but they were certainly supportive of Jagan because he was East
                    Indian. The blacks probably represent only about 34%-35% of the population. East
                    Indians, of course, were brought in by the British as indentured servants after
                    slavery had been abolished in British empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>So a political coalition within Guyana was established with Forbes Burnham, a
                    black, heading it. And a major effort was brought about to bring all the ethnic
                    groups outside of the East Indian ethnic group together in opposition to the
                    Jagan candidacy. This effort was successful. Some observers have said that there
                    was a good deal of rigging that went on in achieving this outcome. But in any
                    event, Forbes Burnham became the premier and then actually took Guyana into
                    independence as head of this coalition of everybody except the East Indians. So
                    Burnham had been the prime minister since independence. He was still the prime
                    minister when I arrived.</p>
                <p>Our interests in Guyana at this stage, we had certain interests in bauxite. The
                    British, Canadians, and ourselves had bauxite holdings there, which Burnham was
                    in the process of nationalizing. And, in fact, just before I arrived, he did
                    nationalize Reynolds and folded into his government-owned bauxite conglomerate
                    which included the others that he had already nationalized. That had been worked
                    out. But, fortunately, it was a buyout and not an expropriation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you didn't have legal action such as the
                        Hickenlooper Amendment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our policy is we don't oppose expropriation if it's
                        adequately compensated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Adequate compensation, yes. “Appropriate and adequate compensation,” I
                    believe is the wording. “Prompt” may also be in there somewhere. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>In any event, our interests were extremely reduced, of course, when I did arrive.
                    We were still interested in the political situation. In the meantime, Burnham
                    had drifted leftward and many felt that he might be a crypto-communist himself.
                    I don't think that was the case at all, but in any event, he had begun a
                    flirtation with Moscow himself. However, Moscow still had that firm tie to
                    Cheddi Jagan, which they were never going to renege on. But our commercial or
                    economic interests were slight, but we were still interested in what might
                    happen internally and whether or not the government of Guyana might become
                    communist.</p>
                <p>It was a cooperative republic, as such, but the economy was nationalized almost
                    totally. I think 80% of the economy was controlled by the government. The
                    economic condition of the country grew steadily worse in the time I was there.
                    It had been growing steadily worse from roughly the time of the move toward
                    nationalization. There was a great exchange problem. The foreign exchange of the
                    government was almost nil.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>And the political situation was Cheddi Jagan and his party were still functioning
                    as minority loyal opposition, if you will, within the Assembly. But the Assembly
                    had a blocking two-thirds control by the government. So the government could do
                    whatever it wished and get approval by the National Assembly on the basis of its
                    two-thirds control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel your job was more, as it is in many
                        countries, more a watching brief than trying to play an active role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. It was clear that because we had sharply reduced our aid program over
                    the years that it was unlikely—Burnham was shrewd enough to understand it was
                    unlikely there would be any new outpouring of American assistance or any
                    augmentation of the small program we had, which amounted, I think, to something
                    like $12 million a year when I arrived.</p>
                <p>But the relationship was—I knew Burnham, of course, from my days as Director of
                    Caribbean Affairs. I had met and talked with him on a couple of occasions when I
                    was down there visiting. A brilliant individual, he had been a Guyana scholar.
                    In the old days when it was a British possession, the British would choose the
                    most gifted student and give him a full scholarship to Britain, and Burnham had
                    been one of these and had finished his degree in England. He had gotten a law
                    degree from Grays Inn, I believe, one of the Inns of Court. And he was a highly
                    successful lawyer at the time he began to move in politics in Guyana.</p>
                <p>He didn't have a great deal of interest in economics. I think that the way he
                    perceived the country was as follows. He knew that his support was the black
                    minority, really, and that in any free, open economic competition, probably the
                    black minority would be overwhelmed by the Indian majority, the Indian traders
                    and whatnot. So that was, I believe, his reason for having all of the economy,
                    or almost all of the economy, under the control of the government. And it made
                    sense in terms of his political interests and needs. He played a fairly
                    important role in Caribbean councils. He had a reputation, of course. He
                    considered himself the equal, which he was, of the prime ministers of Trinidad
                    and Jamaica and Barbados and would meet frequently with them. He had a foreign
                    minister who, interestingly enough, was of East Indian origin, who left to
                    become the secretary general of the Commonwealth, which job he now holds.</p>
                <p>But Burnham was a very interesting man to know and to talk to and he was a very
                    stimulating interlocutor. But there wasn't a lot we could do in the country, or
                    I think that the national interest as perceived by Washington was more or less,
                    “Well, let's see how it goes. We'll keep our modest aid program. But there's no
                    point in going further.” Burnham had invited the North Koreans to come in. They
                    had an embassy there. And the Chinese had been brought in very early on, as
                    early as 1972 and '73. So these were large missions both the Chinese and North
                    Koreans had there. And the Libyans were there. So it was a watching brief, by
                    and large.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could we then talk about the People's Temple
                        situation, which I guess pretty well absorbed your time as much as
                        possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Certainly I was aware of the People's Temple situation before I arrived. I
                    was briefed on it in the Department. I knew that Jim Jones had been a prominent
                    political figure in California, that he had been Commissioner of Housing for the
                    City of San Francisco, and that Moscone, who was then the mayor of San Francisco
                    and acknowledged that without the assistance and support of People's Temple and
                    its votes that he probably never would have been elected mayor.</p>
                <p>I certainly had not a clear idea, either from the literature I read or
                    conversations, just of what the philosophy of the religious orientation of
                    People's Temple was. It seemed a little fuzzy. And in any event, I was
                    interested in the fact that some estimates varied anywhere between 800 and 1,000
                    Americans had chosen to come down to Guyana and participate in the establishment
                    of this community in a very remote part of Guyana. In fact, the area in which it
                    was located was very close to the contested border with Venezuela, and the land
                    on which it was situated I think Venezuela still claims, although they haven't
                    in recent years made any effort to take it over again. But it is a very remote
                    part of the country.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, I asked my consul whether or not he had visited the place, how
                    often, and I was able to get the Department to authorize the charter of an
                    aircraft so that we could at least have quarterly visits to the site to talk to
                    members. And we were getting letters from time to time of next of kin in the
                    United States expressing concern about the welfare, whereabouts, of relatives.
                    And the consul would accumulate these letters, and on his trips would ask to see

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Dick McCoy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Dick McCoy. A systematic job of doing this. The Temple had—I think it was
                    established in '74, and they made a great PR effort throughout Guyana. They had
                    an office in Georgetown, and this office in Georgetown handled all their
                    shipments in and out and did their PR work with the Guyanese government and with
                    various people who would come to visit. They made a great effort to get members
                    of the Guyanese government, especially the minister of education, the minister
                    of social welfare to come up and visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>And it was a remarkable establishment. It probably had a more sophisticated
                    infrastructure than any Guyanese community in that part of Guyana. I think there
                    were something like 140 permanent dwellings associated with it. And they cleared
                    over, I think, 900 acres of jungle, and had it under cultivation in the period
                    of '77-'78. They were not self-sufficient yet. They were obliged to import a
                    good deal of their food and the other materials and resources they needed for
                    sustenance and whatnot. But they put on a very good show for all visitors, and
                    they made a great effort, as I say, to—they had a weekly radio program that was
                    aired on the radio in Georgetown, and all the prominent visitors would be
                    invited to expand on the great experiment that had been undertaken by Jim Jones
                    and his followers in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been a very ticklish situation, because I'm
                        speaking as a consular officer, and I know the problems. I was not directly
                        concerned, but I read the correspondence of our problem with a boatful of
                        scientologists off Greece. But if you tried to talk to people who were in
                        these things, you could be accused of interfering, and there were suits and
                        counter-suits, and, I mean, it was a very messy business, and the Privacy
                        Act. Did you feel yourself inhibited on what you could do? Were you getting
                        instructions on how to deal with this from Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, as you know, having been a consular officer and knowing the
                    restrictions under which an embassy operates, a private American citizen abroad,
                    the embassy has no control over it until such time as he might come a cropper or
                    be arrested by the local authorities. And then all you can do is go visit and
                    make certain that he is being treated, or she is being treated, in accordance
                    with local laws and regulations and that if a person is going to be subject to
                    trial that they will be represented by appropriate counsel. If the individual
                    who is arrested wants next of kin notified, the consular officer can do that.
                    But if the individual chooses not to have next of kin notified, the consular
                    officer is restricted from independently notifying the next of kin abroad
                    because of privacy considerations.</p>
                <p>As far as instructions from the Department were concerned regarding Jonestown, I
                    had no special instructions. I certainly reported everything we were doing in
                    terms of visitation. I, as I said, got the Department's rather grudging
                    agreement to spend the money for chartering a plane every quarter to send the
                    consul up there to visit. And that was really about the extent of it. Every time
                    our man came back, he would file a report on what he had seen and heard, and it
                    was duly submitted to the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The Jonestown operation, the people immediately around Jim Jones, were
                    well-educated people, some lawyers. They were very familiar with not only the
                    Privacy Act but also the Freedom of Information Act, and I knew that People's
                    Temple had filed a Freedom of Information request for every report that had been
                    made on the Temple from the embassy in Georgetown predating my arrival. And they
                    had made similar FOIA requests, Freedom of Information requests, to the Bureau,
                    the FBI, regarding their activities in San Francisco and in the California
                    region. So they were aware of the protections they had and exercised them with
                    considerable vigor.</p>
                <p>Not too long after my arrival, Mrs. Jones—Jim Jones, I should say, did not come
                    to Georgetown during the period of my embassy before the events associated with
                    the demise of People's Temple. Mrs. Jones did come to call on me one day with a
                    couple of the people from the Georgetown office, and it was a courtesy call. She
                    told me all about what they were trying to do, outlined in some detail just when
                    they expected to be self-sufficient; ostentatiously showed me a handwritten
                    letter that Jim had received from Mrs. Carter, the President's wife, thanking
                    Jim Jones for having organized rallies on behalf of President Carter during the
                    campaign of 1976; made a great point of the political connections that they had
                    in the state of California.</p>
                <p>For example, then Lieutenant Governor Dymally, who is now a representative in
                    Congress, actually had introduced Jim Jones to Forbes Burnham. Dymally is
                    himself Trinidadian born and knew Burnham and actually brought Jones down when
                    he was first looking for a place to establish his People's Temple. And Burnham
                    told me later on when we were discussing the People's Temple that—this is after
                    the fact—that he probably would never have agreed to the establishment of
                    People's Temple if Dymally hadn't been the one who brought Jones down and had
                    introduced him and had vouched for him and the whole effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What prompted the Ryan visit? Leo Ryan, a congressman,
                        when there and was killed. But he went with your DCM. How did this
                        occurrence come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, we'd received notification—I guess it must have been in September of
                    1978 or possibly August—that Congressman Ryan and Congressman Darwinski were
                    planning a visit to Guyana, and they wanted to visit Jonestown. And there were a
                    series of meetings between officers of the Department and Ryan and Ryan's staff
                    over the next several weeks organizing the visit and how it was being laid out.
                    I informed the Department, of course, that Congressman Ryan would have to enter
                    into direct contact with People's Temple if he expected to be received in
                    Jonestown, because I had no authority to barge into Jonestown if the
                    administration of Jonestown didn't want my presence or the presence of anyone
                    else. And it had been made clear to us that the government of Guyana respected
                    their wishes in terms of how they controlled the community.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>So Ryan did, indeed, or his staff, did get in touch with Jones and with the
                    people, I believe, first of all in San Francisco—there was still an office in
                    San Francisco or representatives of People's Temple there—and the mechanics were
                    worked out in sort of a three-way operation. We certainly communicated to
                    People's Temple the desire of Ryan to visit them and urged them to receive Ryan.
                    They expressed concern because they said that Ryan had been unduly influenced by
                    certain people in the Bay area who had defected from People's Temple and that he
                    intended to bring these people down with him. They felt that he was essentially
                    an unfriendly individual and would not come with an open mind, that he had
                    already made up his mind about People's Temple.</p>
                <p>In any event, we continued to exercise whatever influence we could on People's
                    Temple and representatives in Georgetown and also my consul on his trip, and my
                    DCM, as a matter of fact, to Jonestown saying that the Congressman appeared to
                    go ahead with his visit and that it seemed to us that he should be received. So
                    the trip finally began to take shape, and it did come to pass. I can't remember
                    the precise date of Leo Ryan's arrival, but I offered him hospitality, and he
                    stayed with me in the period he was in Georgetown before going up to
                    Jonestown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any indications that the situation in Jonestown
                        was really turning rancid, I mean, that you were getting at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: No. We knew about the acute suspicion on the part of Jones and the people
                    around him regarding Ryan's motives. And they hadn't finally agreed to let him
                    in, let Ryan in. And that was communicated to Ryan before he left Washington,
                    and Ryan's staff. However, beyond that, we certainly had no inkling that the
                    situation was likely to turn violent. I think our feeling was that the worst
                    that might happen is that Leo Ryan might go up to Jonestown and with the media
                    people he brought with him and the defectors from People's Temple and the
                    certain next of kin he had brought with him and that they'd be turned back at
                    the gate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at the crowd that went there, Jim Jones may
                        have suffered paranoia, but in this case, Ryan was out to get him, wasn't
                        he? I mean, in a way, if you arrive with media and with defectors from a
                        place, this is not friendly visit, is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I'm certain that it was not viewed as a friendly visit through the
                    optic that Jones was looking through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your DCM went up, who was—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Richard A. Dwyer.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would this have been a normal thing, or did you want him
                        to go to sort of take care of safety or—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, it seemed as a common courtesy. When you have a CODEL visiting, of
                    course, the Department requires that a control officer be appointed. And it
                    seemed to me that Dick Dwyer having visited the place himself as DCM along with
                    the consul on one of the regular consular visits, he knew the people, he knew
                    the ground, and he was a very able FSO—he's now retired. But I had absolute
                    confidence in him in being able to handle almost any situation that might arise.
                    So he was the control officer, and it seemed to me that Leo Ryan expected
                    appropriate courtesies extended to him, and that's why I asked Dick to go
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they went up, what happened? How did the Department
                        respond to all this? Were you descended upon with all sorts of people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, you can imagine the situation that developed. Of course, this is
                    rather a long story and I'd really prefer to—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, can we do it again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. I'd like to. I'd like to very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we do it again? I think it's important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we cut it off at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: All right. That would be fine. I'd be delighted to go into this, but it
                    really deserves more time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, we've got a little more time now. You had sent your
                        DCM up with Leo Ryan and this group to Jonestown. What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I would like to make one parenthetical remark before we move into that.
                    When the Department had informed the embassy that the Ryan CODEL was coming—</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might just for the record say CODEL means congressional
                        delegation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Congressional delegation, right. I was concerned because of the Privacy
                    Act and the Freedom of Information Act and how they would play on the
                    relationship between Congressman Ryan and the people who were coming with him
                    and, of course, Jones and the People's Temple community. I asked the Department
                    to send along one of the lawyers from the legal advisor's office so that if
                    questions arose regarding any of the embassy's records or records of
                    conversations with People's Temple or with the representatives of Jim Jones that
                    we could get some expert legal advice as to what could and could not be shown to
                    the congressman and those people accompanying him on the basis of the Privacy
                    Act and how it protected the People's Temple and the representatives of the
                    People's Temple.</p>
                <p>The Department said that they really didn't have anyone available to send. I sent
                    yet another telegram and slugged it for the personal attention of the Assistant
                    Secretary for Latin America Pete Vaky and asked him to intervene with the legal
                    advisor's office and see if he could not prevail upon them to provide this
                    expert advice. And I ultimately got a cable from Vaky reiterating the position
                    taken by the legal advisor that they just had no one available that they could
                    provide to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But if this does give a setting for something that we
                        really were not prepared for, I'm not talking about what actually happened
                        in Jonestown, but dealing with a private American organization which is
                        under public scrutiny, because of the Privacy Act and the Freedom of
                        Information Act. So both sides can more or less read any communication that
                        goes from them and leaving it open for the ground rules are rather
                        unclear—at least certainly at that time they were unclear—and leaving one in
                        a very exposed legal position if you have aggressive lawyers on either side
                        of this situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. This relates to something we discussed earlier, and that is the
                    limitations, really, on an embassy or a consulate in terms of what control or
                    what sort of influence or what sort of responsibility they have relating to
                    private citizens abroad, and that the embassies or U.S. missions have no real
                    control of any sort over a private American citizen unless that citizen chooses
                    to be responsive to advice or recommendations or what have you that a mission
                    might provide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. If you could sort of give the story then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BURKE: All right. Getting to the visit, Ryan was still negotiating with People's
                    Temple on the question of access after he arrived in Georgetown. He met with
                    representatives of People's Temple and Jim Jones and reiterated his request that
                    he and his party be admitted to Jonestown to meet with the residents there.
                    Jones and his representatives were still reluctant to grant him the permission
                    to enter Jonestown.</p>
                <p>Jones brought or caused two of his lawyers from the San Francisco Bay area to
                    come down and advise him during this visit. One of them was the rather
                    well-known American attorney, Mark Lane, and the other—his name escapes me now,
                    but he was the regular counsel for People's Temple in the Bay area. Lane was,
                    more or less, on retainer with People's Temple. But the other lawyer was a
                    full-time lawyer for People's Temple in the Bay area. These people did talk to
                    Ryan. They made recommendations to Jones that he receive the Ryan CODEL, and I
                    think they ultimately were instrumental in getting Jones' final agreement to let
                    the Ryan party, or at least part of the Ryan party, come in to People's
                    Temple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in your dealings with them—I'm talking about
                        Jones' lawyers—responsive, trying to be of assistance, or did they have
                        another agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: They were very protective of Jones. They had the same suspicions of Ryan
                    and his group that Jones had. So they were actually legal counsel and in the
                    employ of Jones and protective of his interests and interests of People's Temple
                    as they perceived them.</p>
                <p>Now, the difficulties of travel to the Jonestown area I believe we touched on
                    earlier. When the CODEL was preparing to leave Georgetown to go to Jonestown, we
                    did arrange for a charter aircraft to take the party up to the area. There was
                    no airstrip in Jonestown itself, and the nearest airstrip, I believe, was
                    something like seven miles away. And the trip from the airstrip in that remote
                    part of Guyana to Jonestown itself had to be negotiated by a vehicle provided by
                    Jones and People's Temple. As it turned out, I believe they brought them in on a
                    truck, but there was no public transportation of any sort that regularly went
                    from the airstrip to Jonestown. The normal way for People's Temple to get a lot
                    of their supplies was by river, because it was possible for coastal transports
                    to bring supplies from Georgetown almost up to People's Temple. In any event,
                    it's an extremely remote part of Guyana, and most of it is jungle.</p>
                <p>The group left on Friday. They were negotiating right up until the last minute,
                    almost up to the time of takeoff, with Mark Lane, the People's Temple lawyer,
                    and with Jones. The question of entry or the denial of permission to enter was
                    still being negotiated right up until the final moment. And as a matter of fact,
                    the agreement to let Ryan and most of his party in was only given after the
                    party had arrived at the airstrip in the vicinity of People's Temple.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The group did move in, were received at People's Temple. The citizens of
                    Jonestown put on quite an entertainment for them on the Friday evening. And the
                    reception was fairly congenial as reported to me by Dick Dwyer by, let's see, I
                    believe it was radio telephone, the linkage that we had with People's Temple,
                    actually through People's Temple office in Georgetown. That was the only
                    communication link we had actually furnished by Jonestown itself. But Dwyer did
                    report to us on Friday evening that they had gotten in, that Jones had received
                    Ryan, that the reception had been generally a pleasant one. The group seemed to
                    respond to the entertainment and the hospitality provided by the People's Temple
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The arrangement was, given the lateness of their arrival and all, that they would
                    overnight in Jonestown, which they did, and they would come out sometime during
                    the course of Saturday. Now, late on Friday evening—and, of course, this is
                    pretty well covered by several books dealing with the episode—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you recommend do you think is probably the best
                        book on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Probably the best in terms of detail of its research is one done by a
                    journalist who accompanied Ryan. I think he was a journalist for the San
                    Francisco Chronicle or Examiner. And the title of the book, I believe, is White
                    knight. I would be able to add this later on. But I can't remember his name just
                    now. He spent a fair amount—there were several quickie books that came out, but
                    that I would say was the best research book and probably appeared about two
                    years after the episode itself. There was one done by James Reston, a professor
                    at the University of North Carolina, not a bad book. He's the son of Scotty
                    Reston, and he had access to certain materials that weren't available to others.
                    His book is all right—the two of them together. There's also kind of an
                    interesting book done by B.S. Nipal's brother. It's a much more almost
                    psychiatric study of the Jonestown community, and he examined it both in San
                    Francisco and then on the basis of what he learned in Guyana later.</p>
                <p>Late on Friday evening, apparently some of the residents of People's Temple got a
                    message to Ryan saying, in effect, that they'd like to leave with him the next
                    day. He talked to my DCM about it, and certainly my DCM was fully cooperative
                    with Ryan and said that he certainly would lend his influence and authority to
                    help these people leave. The time of departure was approximately noon on
                    Saturday, and when the people who indicated that they wanted to leave with Ryan
                    became known to Jones and to the inner group that advised Jones and were, in
                    essence, the informal council within Jonestown, a good deal of animosity
                    developed between Ryan, the defectors and the loyalists, if you will, the people
                    loyal to Jones. And there was, in fact, one of the people actually tried to stab
                    Ryan at Jonestown. He had a superficial knife would as a consequence of it, but
                    several people intervened before any real damage could be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>The group was finally packed aboard the truck and off they went back to the
                    airstrip. And it was during the boarding operation when the party arrived at the
                    airstrip, and they began to get into the chartered aircraft that were waiting to
                    take them back to Georgetown that the attack occurred. The attack, again, has
                    been well documented by television footage and also by eye-witness accounts.</p>
                <p>A small group from People's Temple had followed the truck in from People's
                    Temple, and when the group was in the process of boarding the aircraft, the
                    group from People's Temple attacked the Ryan party with weapons. Actually, I
                    believe, they were shotguns and a .22 rifle and possibly a higher caliber rifle.
                    As far as I know, there were no automatic weapons used in the attack.
                    Congressman Ryan was killed during the initial attack, as were, I believe, two
                    other members of his party, and several others were wounded, including Richard
                    Dwyer, the DCM.</p>
                <p>One of the aircraft did take off, the larger of the two aircraft. When the attack
                    occurred, the pilot revved his engine and without waiting to take any survivors
                    or others just took off and headed back to Georgetown. The other aircraft, I
                    believe, stayed on the ground. The remainder of the party, the survivors
                    including the wounded, were huddled together on the airstrip, really. They were
                    concerned about the possibility of a further attack by the group that had
                    attacked earlier.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the group after the attack just turned around and went back to
                    Jonestown. They did not wait around to try and ambush the rest of the party.
                    However, the group was in some fear that they would be back, and I certainly
                    can't blame them for that at all. When the group got back to Jonestown, they
                    reported what they had done and reported that they had succeeded in shooting the
                    congressman. They conveyed this information to Jones, and it was at that point
                    that Jones ordered the mass suicide at People's Temple.</p>
                <p>There's a remarkable tape recording of this whole business, the last hour of
                    Jonestown, which one of my consular officers picked up right after the whole
                    event had taken place. I had instructed the consular officers to accumulate as
                    much information as they could in terms of documents, in terms of files, in
                    terms of anything that might be of use in an investigation of Jonestown. And, as
                    I say, one of the consular officers did find this tape on a reel-to-reel tape
                    recorder within the pavilion which was a central structure at Jonestown. And
                    what happened, obviously, was that the tape had been running, and the tape ran
                    all the way to the end and ends in silence, actually. And you can hear the cry
                    of the people as the suicides were taking place, and the people were being
                    encouraged to come up and get their glass of fruit drink or whatever it was
                    laced with poison. It's a remarkable tape, and I think it was quite useful in
                    terms of trying to put the whole thing into some sort of perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BURKE: I'm sorry. This takes us to about 7:00 on Saturday night. Now, the first
                    word I got that something was very wrong, we were waiting, actually, for the
                    aircraft to come back to the airport in Georgetown. And I had one of my consular
                    officers out at the airport with vehicles to pick up the people when they came
                    back. I was at my residence. I was in touch with the people at the airport. I
                    was in touch with the duty officer at the embassy. We were still dependent upon
                    communications through the office of People's Temple in Georgetown. As I said
                    before, that was the only communication link that we had available to us.</p>
                <p>When I got a call from the prime minister's office, he asked me to come see him
                    as soon as possible. So I went to his office and he had most of his Cabinet
                    present with him, and the pilot of the aircraft that had taken off was there.
                    This was obviously the first report that they had gotten about what had
                    happened. So I got this initial report from Prime Minister Burnham and the
                    others present including the pilot.</p>
                <p>Then I excused myself, went immediately back to the embassy, sent off a flash
                    cable and also got on the phone to the Director of the Office of Caribbean
                    Affairs, Ashley Hewitt, and told him on the basis of this very preliminary
                    report that the attack on the Ryan CODEL had taken place, that in all
                    probability Ryan was dead and perhaps several others and that there were
                    wounded, and that the fate of the rest of the party was still up in the air.</p>
                <p>We hadn't at that stage any idea that the mass suicides were taking place at
                    People's Temple. I then went back to the prime minister's office, and we
                    discussed what could be done to rescue the survivors from the airstrip. The
                    airstrip had no lighting of any sort which permits night operation. So there was
                    no question of sending an aircraft up there until first light of Sunday. I asked
                    him if they had any sort of military force in the area that might go to the
                    airstrip and provide protection, and they had nothing immediately available in
                    that part of Guyana. So there was really nothing that we could do until Sunday
                    morning.</p>
                <p>Now, it was recalled, of course, that Jones had threatened that if attacked or if
                    his community were put in any sort of jeopardy that they might resort to
                    something like mass suicide. And this was a matter of some speculation and
                    certainly concern during the night. My immediate concern, of course, was getting
                    the people in from the airstrip and getting them some hospital treatment in
                    Georgetown. So it wasn't until Sunday that we began to get people in. We were
                    able to evacuate the wounded and the survivors. But we still—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did the evacuating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Again, charter aircraft that were sent up to the airstrip. This was about
                    the only way to get in and out of—</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any military go up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I'm trying to recall now at this remove. I believe that there were some
                    Guyanese military who were brought up on that first day, the Sunday, and were
                    under instructions to try to get into Jonestown and see what was going on at
                    Jonestown. I can't remember the numbers involved, but my recollection is it was
                    a very small group, perhaps a detachment or certainly no more than a squad,
                    really.</p>
                <p>Now we, of course, got the information from the survivors as to what had
                    happened. In fact, some of the people had gotten out on the aircraft that had
                    flown out after the attack. And, I believe, there was even a can of television
                    film that had gotten aboard that aircraft and was actually broadcast in the
                    United States either Saturday night or early on Sunday. This was actually
                    footage of the attack on Ryan and the shooting of Ryan, and, I think, done by
                    the cameraman who was himself wounded. And I remember particularly because Dick
                    Dwyer's daughter was in college in the United States, and she actually saw the
                    footage before she even knew, and recognized her father as in the party being
                    attacked. So it was remarkable that that particular footage got out so quickly
                    and was broadcast so quickly before we had ourselves firm details.</p>
                <p>My DCM, to his credit, though wounded, was able to provide leadership to the
                    group that was stuck up at the airstrip. Actually, they were pretty well
                    huddled, and there was this bar at one end of airstrip in the tiny community up
                    there. And they all, more or less, congregated there and were able to get
                    something to eat and spent the night, really, in great apprehension as to what
                    their fate might be if the Jonestown group came back.</p>
                <p>That really pretty well covers the event itself. As you can well imagine, as soon
                    as my message got to Washington and was passed around the official community in
                    Washington, and the Director of Caribbean Affairs Ashley Hewitt had spread the
                    word as well, we began to get all sorts of requests for amplification, for
                    details and all the rest of it. Our very tiny embassy, really, by most
                    standards, over the next three to four weeks was just about swamped, as you can
                    well imagine. We did press into service the USIA team and the AID people as well
                    and had them all standing watches, and they did, really, a most credible job in
                    terms of supporting this effort.</p>
                <p>When we had firm information that there was no one left alive in Jonestown itself
                    and that there were all of these corpses in the tropical sun, the question of
                    what to do with the remains became a matter of great urgency. Barbara Watson,
                    who was then the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, asked me if local
                    interment could be arranged. I did discuss the matter with the member of
                    Burnham's Cabinet who was placed in charge of their task force, the Guyanese
                    task force, to deal with this great tragedy. And after consultation they said
                    that they'd prefer that the bodies be removed from Guyana, from Guyanese
                    territory. The only way that they could have been interred, really, would be by
                    using bulldozers and creating some sort of a mass grave up on the site.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Once the decision was taken by the Guyanese government that the bodies should be
                    removed from Guyanese territory, then it became a problem for us as to how to
                    deal with this. The U.S. military, of course, had had previous experience of
                    this sort. There was a collision of two jumbo jets on the ground in the Azores,
                    perhaps—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was the Azores.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes, where many hundreds were dead, and the Army did move in and did take
                    out all the bodies. This was a much more difficult task, obviously, because you
                    were dealing with a part of Guyana where there was no strip capable of taking a
                    large aircraft of any sort, a large transport. The only jet strip in the entire
                    country was the jet strip at Georgetown. So what had to be done, really, was to
                    use the strip at Georgetown as the transfer point and bring in large helicopters
                    and the graves registration team to prepare the bodies at Jonestown, lift them
                    from Jonestown to Georgetown, put them aboard the C-141s and then transfer them
                    to Dover, Delaware, air base.</p>
                <p>The whole thing was put together, and it was remarkable, really, how smoothly
                    this whole operation went. The U.S. military did things on this particular
                    operation they had never done operationally before such as refueling the large
                    helicopters when they were making the transit from the United States down to
                    Guyana. Ultimately, the State Department was billed for the cost of this whole
                    effort. In retrospect, I told the Department they should have prevailed upon the
                    Pentagon to actually write off the cost of this operation against their training
                    budget, because it really provided the sort of exercise that the U.S. military
                    seldom gets in a part of the world that they knew little about.</p>
                <p>But to the credit of the military, I don't believe there was a single injury to
                    any of the troops involved. There was no crash of any of the helicopters during
                    their carrying exercise. It just was a remarkable performance, really, by all
                    hands.</p>
                <p>Guyana, of course, became the focal point of world press attention for a matter
                    of at least 72 hours, and swarms of journalists descended upon Jonestown, in
                    Georgetown, really. There were, I think, at one stage 350 foreign journalists
                    who were in Georgetown covering this whole story. There was a very difficult
                    press relations exercise to handle because it was almost impossible for these
                    people to get up to the scene. The Guyanese government had two briefers who were
                    qualified to handle press. We had a two-man USIS operation, and the strain was
                    really enormous on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any attempt on the USIA to send somebody
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BURKE: No. I don't recall any extra help that came in from USIA side. The
                    Department did send us in some consular assistance, and they also arranged for
                    Vic Dykos, who was the DCM in Panama, to come over and temporarily replace Dick
                    Dwyer, who, of course, was wounded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How badly was he wounded?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: He took a small caliber rifle bullet in the buttocks. Actually he's still
                    carrying the bullet around with him, because the surgeon in Georgetown was
                    unwilling to operate because of the angle at which the bullet had gone in. And
                    even though it was not a deep wound, it lodged up in an area where there might
                    have been complications with nerves, and actually it ended up near the spine. So
                    the decision was taken not to operate and extract the bullet. But he was laid up
                    for the better part of two weeks before he could return to duty.</p>
                <p>As i had begun to say, the Department did provide certain amount of consular
                    help, the temporary DCM, and we did begin to get representatives of the FBI
                    down, of course, looking into the matter. And it was, indeed, fortunate that
                    when I was able to get my consular officers up to Jonestown on some of the first
                    helicopters going in there, and I had, as I said earlier, instructed them to
                    scoop up everything they could in the way of documentary evidence relating to
                    Jonestown, so that we could somehow piece together how all this had transpired.
                    And we ended up, I think, with about five crates of materials which ultimately
                    were provided to the FBI, made available to them for their own
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impact? You were completely occupied with the
                        things that were happening there, the public relations side now. But how did
                        you feel as far as, you know, if something happens in your district, I mean,
                        a Jonestown or an earthquake or something, all of it becomes kind of not
                        only your responsibility, but there's a thing about “Why did he let this
                        happen here?” Were you feeling this sort of pressure of everybody running
                        around trying to figure how to pass the buck?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, certainly there was no doubt in my mind that there would be a
                    certain amount of postmortem examination for official purposes of this whole
                    affair. And I certainly was prepared for it, and I felt that the record of my
                    embassy in terms of our dealings with Jonestown prior to Ryan's arrival, the
                    CODEL's arrival, were impeccable.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I had also, of course, sent a long telegram in June of 1978 outlining the
                    particular problems that Jonestown presented to us as the consular
                    responsibility and asking—actually making a recommendation that I be instructed
                    to approach the Guyanese government and begin discussions with the Guyanese
                    government about Jonestown, asking the advice of the legal advisor's office and
                    the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, at their levels to give this
                    matter a great deal of consideration and whether or not, given the privacy laws
                    and the rights of private Americans abroad, that this would be interpreted as an
                    intrusion, an official intrusion, if we were to go and talk to the Guyanese
                    government about this community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that everything that you wrote was
                        going to be read eventually, through the Freedom of Information, by the
                        Jonestown people and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: We already knew that there had been Freedom of Information requests for
                    all of our files filed by People's Temple and that they were being processed.
                    These requests were being processed back in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that this was an inhibitor as far as frank
                        reporting situations, particularly in this type of situation but in any
                        type, that you had to resort either to other means or that you couldn't tell
                        the full story?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, certainly it was an inhibition to this extent, that you could not
                    pass back raw gossip, rumor, innuendo, that anything that reported had to be
                    absolutely accurate in terms of factual content. Shortly after I arrived, and I
                    began to talk to my then consul, Richard McCoy, about People's Temple and his
                    various meetings with People's Temple, and he informed me that his meetings that
                    usually two or three representatives would show up to meet with him. These were
                    people from the Georgetown office coming into the consular section to talk about
                    this, that, and the other thing.</p>
                <p>So I instructed him from then on he should not take on these people solo, and
                    that he should always have another consular officer present with him in such
                    meetings so that there would be protection to him of another witness so that he
                    wouldn't be put into an exposed position of having people alleging that he had
                    said something and he having no witness, no separate witness, who could
                    contradict that story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Irrespective of this turning out the way it did, you felt
                        that you were having to deal with a situation. I'm speaking from a legal
                        point of view and all, that you were almost quicksand, that you had to be
                        very, very careful of what you worded, whether it's in talking to the people
                        at the Temple, or writing to the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. Well, certainly everything that we filed on Jonestown was as precise
                    as possible, and did not contain materials which could be construed as
                    actionable by legal representatives of People's Temple or Jones or any of the
                    people living there in the community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the other form of communication? In a
                        way, this is somewhat at the heart of what we're actually doing here in
                        recording conversation. Because there is a feeling that the official
                        records, particularly since the Freedom of Information has come across, but
                        is even more of an inhibition than there always has been about putting
                        things on the paper. And so that much of what is done within the Department
                        of State between posts, it's done by telephone call or by informal letter or
                        by blind visits. I mean, were you resorting to any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I have always been opposed to the idea of doing much in the way of
                    substantive reporting by telephone, primarily because you don't have a record of
                    what's been transmitted. You've got, in your own mind, if you've made a note or
                    a memorandum for the file, you know pretty much what you've said. You can't be
                    absolutely certain whether or not your remarks were misinterpreted at the other
                    end or that you had been imprecise in the way that you had said it, or that the
                    individual you were speaking with at the Washington end misconstrued what you
                    had said. But primarily because in most cases there's no record of a telephone
                    conversation. So I really never cared for this as a means of communication
                    except in extreme situations when that was the only thing available to you. So I
                    really did not do any reporting on Jonestown other side of regular telegraphic
                    channels.</p>
                <p>Now, in the period prior to the Jonestown affairs, I do know that on one
                    occasion, my consular, Richard McCoy, was going to Washington and that this is a
                    matter of fact. His trip coincided with the defection of one of the female
                    members of People's Temple who came to us for assistance—Debbie Blakey, I think,
                    was her name. Again, I'd have to look at the file to be absolutely sure of the
                    name and spelling. And given the fact that he was going up for a consular
                    meeting, I told him when he got to the Department to be sure and report. We did
                    telegraphic teleporting on her defection and what had been furnished to her in
                    the way of support and assistance by the Assembly. But I told him to provide
                    background to people in consular affairs about this matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had any mention or had it even come to you about—sort of
                        got into the record at all—that there was a possibility of mass
                        suicide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: I'm sure I must have heard it from possibly in connection with the Blakey
                    defection, but I certainly did hear of it. It seemed to me extraordinary,
                    obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, I don't think anybody would have thought
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. One of the difficulties in dealing with an institution like People's
                    Temple is that people on both sides are oftentimes extremists. I think when one
                    thinks about People's Temple when it was originally established, that the idea
                    of close to 1,000 people leaving the United States, coming down to establish a
                    community in the wilds of Guyana under the leadership of a very charismatic,
                    religious leader, it's extraordinary. And I guess my problem was or would be
                    that I find it difficult to imagine what would cause people to do this.
                    Certainly the charisma of the individual leader, that might have been it, the
                    promise of some sort of an Eden in Guyana for these people. It's just
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>But most people who would associate with something like this would have a
                    tendency towards being a zealot. So, therefore, they're zealous in terms of
                    their initial support for such an enterprise, and then when, for one reason or
                    another, they might become disaffected with the enterprise, they become almost
                    as zealous in their opposition to it. So with rumors associated with Jonestown
                    and with Jones himself and charges against him and against the community, there
                    was the absence of any sort of an objective witness to separate the fact from
                    the fiction in terms of both stories, if you will.</p>
                <p>Now, one thing that did not become very clear in terms of the reportage on
                    Jonestown is that despite the fact that this was an extremely remote part of
                    Guyana in which the People's Temple was established, People's Temple went out of
                    its way to encourage visits by Guyanese government officials, by people from
                    Guyana, prominent people from the diplomatic missions in Georgetown. They had a
                    weekly radio program, for example, that was taped in Jonestown and broadcast. I
                    think they bought time off of the local radio station in Georgetown. And they
                    would highlight on these radio broadcasts the visits that various celebrities
                    had made to Jonestown: the Minister of Education, Minister of Culture, the
                    representatives of various embassies that had come to visit.</p>
                <p>They also, of course, applied for membership in the Guyana Council of Churches,
                    and right up until the end of Jonestown and People's Temple, the People's Temple
                    was a full member of the Guyana Council of Churches, and the Guyana Council of
                    Churches included every denomination in the country—Catholic, Episcopalian,
                    Methodist. Just every religious denomination was represented on the Guyana
                    Council of Churches. And, of course, representatives of the Guyana Council of
                    Churches did pay visits from time to time to Jonestown. So one was really forced
                    to conclude, at least in the eyes of many, this was a responsible
                    enterprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we've talked about what happened. Can we move to,
                        you might say, the spotlight, the heat? How did this work with you? I mean,
                        obviously Congress was enraged because one of their own was killed. Congress
                        en masse does not understand the limitations that we have, and they have to
                        blame somebody. And obviously you couldn't blame the Guyanese government,
                        which sort of left you and your embassy. I mean, how did this work with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, certainly after the immediate problem had been dealt with and the
                    evacuation of the remains and when things began to get back to some sort of
                    normal, then the investigations began. The congressional investigation consisted
                    of a visit by three staff members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Ryan,
                    of course, had been a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and, as a
                    matter of fact, the congressional delegation that he was authorized to conduct
                    was under the auspices of the House Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p>It's interesting, in a way, that when the congressional delegation was originally
                    announced to us, it was going to include two members—Ryan plus a minority
                    member, Edward Derwinski. But somewhere along the line, Derwinski dropped out of
                    the equation, and it became Ryan alone. Ryan, when he arrived and we were
                    chatting one evening in my residence, I asked him about this, and he said,
                    “Well, the normal situation for a congressional delegation is to have
                    representatives of both majority and minority side,” and that his CODEL had been
                    approved on the understanding that there would be a minority member. But when
                    the minority member dropped out, he'd pressed ahead, in any event. He suggested
                    that the chairman, Clement Zablocki, was not too pleased with the fact that it
                    was going to be a single-member CODEL going down there. But this is just hearsay
                    on what Ryan himself told me. But then that's all by the by.</p>
                <p>In response to your question. The first investigation was conducted by these
                    three staffers from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. They conducted
                    interviews. They brought along a stenographer and conducted interviews with me,
                    with the other members of my staff who had been involved in any way with
                    People's Temple. They attempted to take testimony from the prime minister and
                    various other officials within the Guyanese government. But despite personal
                    letters from Congressman Zablocki as chairman to the Guyanese government asking
                    for their cooperation and participation, they were denied any such sessions.</p>
                <p>The other investigation as such was one conducted by two retired Foreign Service
                    officers. The two were John Hugh Crimmins, who had been ambassador to Brasilia,
                    I believe, and earlier to the Dominican Republic; and a retired consular
                    officer, Stanley Carpenter. They came down sometime after the visit by the House
                    Foreign Affairs Committee staff, and they conducted their own investigation or
                    review of the embassy's performance. They also were looking at the performance
                    of the Department itself and did meet, of course, with the officers in various
                    parts of the Department that had a connection with it; for example, people in
                    the Consular Affairs and also people in Latin American Bureau. And they duly
                    prepared a report which was issued—oh golly, I can't remember precisely, but
                    considerably after the event.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Those were the only two investigations as such. We had several journalists who
                    came through working on books. We briefed them, talked to them about the whole
                    affair. We did cooperate and work with the agents for the Federal Bureau of
                    Investigations that came down to investigate just the whole Jonestown event with
                    particular relationship to the shooting of Ryan and People's Temple and how it
                    operated. But that was about it in terms of official investigation.</p>
                <p>Now, I think it was two years after there was to be a hearing before the House
                    Foreign Affairs Committee, and they asked me and Dwyer, my DCM, plus Richard
                    McCoy, plus Doug Ellis, who was McCoy's successor as consul and was actually the
                    consul at the time of Jonestown, the affair, to testify before the—actually it
                    was a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It was a subcommittee
                    chaired by Dante Fascell. It would have been the Latin American Subcommittee on
                    the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
                <p>I prepared a long statement, a formal statement, which I intended to give at the
                    opening of those hearings, and I duly submitted it 72 hours in advance as you
                    are expected to do with any sort of formal statements that executive branch
                    officials give before congressional committees. And the hearing was cancelled
                    one hour before it was scheduled to begin, or two hours, I think, without any
                    real explanation. I heard later that the chairman of the full committee,
                    Zablocki, had decided that he didn't want to pursue this matter. That was
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about within the Department? Did you feel any
                        subtle or not so subtle annoyance? I mean, even people who have been—it's
                        changed a bit—but who have been taken as hostage have found that if
                        something has gone wrong in your area that nobody wants to—at least if
                        there's a problem, I won't say nobody will associate with you, but there is
                        not a rallying around as much as there is almost a sense of avoidance for a
                        while. Did you feel this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, certainly. I guess the one thing that struck me as curious about the
                    Crimmins-Carpenter investigation that was conducted, it seemed to me appropriate
                    if there were to be a departmental investigation it should have been done by the
                    Inspector General. The Crimmins-Carpenter mission did not come under the
                    Inspector General. Actually, it was directed by a man named Nimetz, who I think
                    at the time was counselor of the Department. He was a lawyer who came into the
                    Department with Cyrus Vance, and I think after Vance left as Secretary he went
                    back to the law firm in New York with Vance. But this seemed to me to be outside
                    the official norms of conducting investigation.</p>
                <p>We had cooperated fully with Crimmins and Carpenter when they came down, of
                    course, and provided them with all the information they asked for. But it struck
                    me as odd that this investigation was being carried out under the counselor of
                    the Department rather than the Inspector General. That would have been the
                    appropriate thing to send a team of inspectors and do a special inspection of
                    the post. It would have been the appropriate way to proceed.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I think that the Department was particularly concerned about this whole matter of
                    Jonestown for several reasons. One, because obviously the idea of losing a
                    congressman wasn't all that attractive. And there was another aspect, too. You
                    may recall that right after this whole matter erupted, the connection of various
                    important political figures with Jones began to surface. Jones was, as I believe
                    I mentioned in an earlier part of our discussion, was an important political
                    figure in California at one time, and he had played a key role in the election
                    of the then mayor of San Francisco, Moscone, and had himself served in an
                    official capacity as housing commissioner for the City of San Francisco. He had
                    connections with Willy Brown, I believe, the speaker of the California Assembly.
                    He also had connections with Dymally, who was then lieutenant governor of
                    California, and several other political figures.</p>
                <p>On the national level, too, he had several letters of congratulations from
                    various politicians whom he had assisted over the years. So the whole Jonestown
                    affair, from the point of view of the Department, was a very sticky one and way
                    out of the norm of usual diplomatic practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, too, was there still sort of a backlash from what
                        had happened in Chile where there had been acquisitions, a book and a movie
                        had come out that our embassy really hadn't done enough to help young
                        Americans who were killed by the coup in Chile when the military
                        dictatorship came up? I don't know whether this was part of the atmosphere
                        at that time or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. Well, I think there may have been. I never heard of anybody raise the
                    possibility of a connection with the Chile affair. There were, in the first days
                    of the whole business expressions of concern that the embassy had not done more
                    to be on top of this matter. But then when people began to look at our record,
                    the embassy's record on this, what we had done on the way of reporting on
                    Jonestown and People's Temple well before the event, it was pretty clear that
                    the embassy had done quite a responsible job and probably gone as far as it
                    could given the natural and legal inhibitions that now confront us in dealing
                    with consular problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was looking through a newsletter that comes out on
                        a weekly basis called, “Facts on File,” dealing with newspaper accounts. And
                        in it there was a mention that at some point later on that the Commission
                        that was looking at this—I guess it must have been the Crimmins
                        Commission—said that your June long report was too carefully worded, which
                        sounds to me being a bit factious. Because if something is carefully worded,
                        everybody can read both between the lines. And they know exactly what the
                        Freedom of Information inhibitions are on reporting on American citizens.
                        And that certainly this is the way—I mean, again, I think the word
                        “precious” comes out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I must say, I was less than happy with the Crimmins and Carpenter
                    report, because it seemed to me that they bent over backwards to try and protect
                    the Department as far as they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think maybe this is what they were set up to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. In any event, they did make—I can't remember the exact words they
                    used, but it's pretty close to what you've just said that somehow my June cable
                    was so abstruse or so convoluted that it wasn't fully understood in the
                    Department. But then they failed to reprint my cable in their report even though
                    I had made it a LOU when I originally drafted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: LOU means limited official use.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Limited official use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the lowest classification.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Which is no classification, it's just administration protection to keep
                    anybody who might be intercepting our plain cable traffic from reading it. But
                    certainly it was not classified in any way. It wasn't meant to be classified.
                    But it had long since been made open to the public.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, would it be possible to get? Do you have a
                        copy of it, by any chance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you give me a copy to put in this report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it would be interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. Yes, I'll see if I—I must have a copy somewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>But in any event, they did a precise of my cable in their report instead of
                    reprinting the whole thing. So I found rather curious the fact that they'd
                    comment on the quality of my drafting and then not give the public-at-large an
                    effort to judge for themselves. And furthermore, if my cable were unclear for
                    any reason, all the Department had to do was come back and say, “We didn't
                    understand this,” or “Did you mean this or that or the other thing?” Because I
                    certainly received no such cable. The Department did replay three weeks later
                    and said, “No, don't go to talk to the Guyanese government.”</p>
                <p>I was so outraged by the Crimmins-Carpenter report, quite honestly, that I
                    demanded that my cable and the Department's response to it be released to the
                    public. And the Department said, yes, they would do this. And then a journalist
                    friend of mine came through, Jerry O'Leary, and he was then working for the
                    Washington Star, and asked me about the cable.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, the Department has said they were going to release it.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “It hasn't been released yet.”</p>
                <p>So he went back to Washington and demanded copies of it, which he got and then
                    did quite a good front-page story, as a matter of fact, giving my side of the
                    debate.</p>
                <p>Well, in any event, the Department's handling of this was curious, indeed, the
                    fact that the Crimmins-Carpenter team had been established rather than using the
                    regular Inspector General's teams, and the curious report that they produced
                    which seemed to go out of its way to come down on the embassy and try and
                    protect the Department as much as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way it's curious. But it's not curious, because
                        this is what the special commissions are designed to do anyway. I'm speaking
                        as an experienced bureaucrat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Before we go back to when you returned to Washington, I would like to ask, in
                    Guyana did you get at all involved in something which goes back to, my God,
                    Teddy Roosevelt's time, and that is the border question between Venezuela and
                    what used to be British Columbia and all? I mean, this is a continually sore
                    point particularly on the Venezuela side. Did this involve you at all then?</p>
                <p>BURKE: The border dispute, fairly important reaches of northeast Guyana are
                    claimed by Venezuela, and in fact, some of the maps that you see in Caracas of
                    Venezuela they've got sizeable chunks of Guyana as part of Venezuela. It really
                    wasn't an important issue while I was there. In fact, Carlos Andres Perez, the
                    President of Venezuela, actually paid a state visit to Georgetown while I was
                    there. So the relationship between Venezuela and Guyana was fairly, not friendly
                    necessarily, but certainly correct at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Now, there was the very interesting suggestion made that the reason Burnham gave
                    that particular territory to Jones to establish his community was so that he
                    would have a trip wire of Americans up there should the Venezuelans ever come
                    across the border and reclaim all of that territory by force. The first thing
                    they would encounter would be 900 American citizens. I asked Burnham about that
                    one time, and he sort of smiled, but he wouldn't officially confirm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine the Venezuelans were rather pleased that they
                        hadn't tried anything at that point, or they would have Jonestown in their
                        front yard or back yard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Guyana in 1979. You came back and you were first
                        with the intelligence community staff. Again, this, of course, is an
                        unclassified interview, but could you describe, if you can, what that did
                        and what were some of the problems in that sort of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I really can't go into much detail of the substance of the work we
                    were doing. Under the Executive Order, the Director of Central Intelligence has
                    responsibilities beyond just CIA. He has oversight responsibilities for the
                    entire intelligence community which includes, of course, the Bureau of
                    Intelligence Research of the Department, which includes NSA, the National
                    Security Agency, which includes CIA, of course, which includes the Defense
                    Intelligence Agency. And even though these are—his control is really that, as I
                    said, of oversight, but he has a coordinating function and role to play under
                    the Executive Order. And he has a very small staff which really attempts to
                    coordinate intelligence-gathering activities amongst all these elements so that
                    insofar as possible you don't have people prowling the same turf and using
                    resources on the same question or the same intelligence targets.</p>
                <p>And that really is the principle function of the small staff. You have
                    representatives of all the intelligence community serving on the staff. It's
                    almost like the Joint Chiefs. It's not the same thing at all, but in terms of
                    people working for the Joint Chiefs are expected to, more or less, give up their
                    service allegiance while they're functioning on the Joint Staff and put the
                    common wheel above their natural service inclination. And the various people
                    serving on the intelligence community staff really work for a very specific
                    period on detail and usually return to their parent organizations.</p>
                <p>The office I headed was the National Collection Planning Office within the
                    intelligence community staff, and in that capacity I had officers from CIA, from
                    the Defense Department, from the State Department working under me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your observation, how well did the intelligence
                        services cooperate? Was there an awful lot of competition? And was the
                        competition good?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I was a naval intelligence officer during the Korean War, not during
                    World War II, and I had a fair amount of intelligence experience before coming
                    into this job and an association with the military intelligence services. I'd
                    say that the cooperation is—there's still a lot of parochialism, but I'd say
                    it's getting better in terms of cooperation than it was 20 years ago. But
                    there's still a long way to go, and the problem of turf is still an important
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then to move to your last assignment, this was what?
                        Deputy Assistant Secretary for—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For Administration. But dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, head of the Classification-Declassification Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you say what this comprised of and what were the
                        problems with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. Well, as you know, the Freedom of Information Act has put a
                    responsibility on all government agencies to provide information on request to
                    any American citizen. If you have the price of a stamp and a fixed address, you
                    can ask any agency to give you just any information for which they have
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>You can, for example, write into the Department of State and say, “I want
                    yesterday's cables from Moscow.” And the Department—it doesn't mean you're going
                    to get them. But the Department has to process your request, which means that
                    they will receive your request, they'll pull out all the cables that came out of
                    Moscow yesterday, they'll be reviewed to see whether or not they can be
                    declassified and made available to the requestor.</p>
                <p>And as you can imagine, the number of requests coming in to a department such as
                    State, such as Defense, such as CIA from the public at large for official
                    information. These requests are really enormous both in terms of number and
                    size, and the Department established the Classification-Declassification Center
                    to try and get a handle on this problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>In addition to both the Freedom of Information side, the Department for years
                    predating Freedom of Information has had this program of releasing its own files
                    on a 30-year basis and putting out volumes prepared by the historian's office,
                    the historian of the Department of State, on various aspects of our foreign
                    relations. This whole series began back in 1961, and in the process you have to
                    declassify and examine what the historian's office proposes to put in these
                    particular volumes to see if they still have sensitivities. So the
                    Classification-Declassification Center really functions as a filter to decide
                    what is still sensitive and what may be released, both under Freedom of
                    Information and under the “Foreign Relations of the U.S. Series” which is the
                    official title for this program of releasing systematically our diplomatic
                    files.</p>
                <p>Also, of course, the stuff that doesn't appear in the “Foreign Relations of the
                    U.S.” volumes, as you can imagine, it's just a fairly small percentage of
                    documents that actually appear therein, the bulk of the stuff goes to the
                    National Archives and is kept there for public scrutiny. But again, that
                    material has to be looked over in terms of its releasability.</p>
                <p>So that was principally what I was. I was director of the office of the
                    Classification-Declassification Center. I had a full-time staff, and I also had
                    approximately, well, a pool of 200 retired Foreign Service officers who did the
                    actual reviewing. These were people who had served in various geographic areas
                    and had risen to the old Foreign Service Grade-3 at least and were considered
                    qualified to review classification documents for both FOIA, Freedom of
                    Information, and the “Foreign Relations of the U.S.” series.</p>
                <p>Also, I got involved in the drafting of the Executive Order on national security
                    information that was issued in 1984 which replaced the Carter Executive Order
                    and, oh, various other problems associated with the general subject of
                    classification and access.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice a real difference between the attitude of
                        the Carter Administration and the Reagan Administration in doing this? Or
                        was this more a perception than an actuality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Actually, I think the Reagan Administration got a bum rap. When the new
                    Executive Order came out in 1984, many people pointed to it as being a more,
                    really, a tighter control of classification than had been the case in the Carter
                    Executive Order. And in some aspects it was. But the interesting thing is that
                    the people who drafted the new Executive Order, by and large, were the
                    bureaucrats who had been working in the various departments and agencies over
                    the years and who were absolutely apolitical, and they just felt that there were
                    certain deficiencies in the Carter Order that had to be corrected. And,
                    therefore, the stricter provisions were actually all proposed by bureaucrats and
                    not by the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very interesting because, you know, these oral
                        history interviews will eventually be read by mainly people who are cursing
                        those who do the screening of the documents. These are designed to be
                        somewhat of a supplement to the documents. So I think it's interesting then
                        to get a flavor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Being in charge of this particular process, where would you put the problem? Is
                    it inhibitions because of personnel? Or is it because of stubbornness on the
                    part of, say, within the Department of State or the National Security Council?
                    Where are the biggest tie-ups as far as getting papers out?</p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, my preparation—I was a graduate student in diplomatic history before
                    I came into the Department of State, and in my role as Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Administration with responsibilities for
                    classification-declassification, I encouraged all of my reviewers to release
                    when possible. Obviously, there are certain things that have to remain
                    classified for the time being. Situations change. Ongoing negotiations can be
                    seriously upset, really, if a document is released which has a bearing on the
                    negotiations and which comes to the attention of the government with which
                    you're dealing. Governments oftentimes operate and react like people, like
                    individuals. So they oftentimes get upset and they permit their upset to impact
                    on negotiations.</p>
                <p>But in any event, State, I think, does a very commendable job in the area of
                    releasing documents. We have released some remarkable stuff, I think, over the
                    years. I think the systematic review of the “Foreign Relations of the U.S.”
                    series, there isn't another government in the world that has a series comparable
                    to that. In terms of what we release under Freedom of Information or on
                    reference from presidential libraries, we routinely release some remarkable
                    stuff. And I think the record of the U.S. generally and the Department of State
                    particularly stands up under the closest of scrutiny.</p>
                <p>Certainly there are people who want more, and I can sympathize with researchers
                    and scholars who want more. But I think given the conflicting positions of what
                    is still sensitive and what has to be protected and what should be gotten out, a
                    fairly good line is walked by the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention that this series started in 1861, and as an
                        historical aside, the famous phrase that Charles Francis Adams used when the
                        British Prime Minister dealing with the British permission of allowing
                        raiders such as the Alabama and the layered [unclear] saying when the
                        British were being somewhat stubborn with Francis Adams that it would be
                        superfluous to add that this could mean war, was reprinted about one year
                        later after he said it. And the reaction of the British was just what you
                        said.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Well, before we end this interview, I would like to turn back to your
                    time—because we were more pressed before—when you were in Bangkok as deputy
                    chief of mission between 1976 and 1977. We just sort of hopped over that. You
                    worked with Charles Whitehouse, who was the ambassador. I wonder, because he's a
                    man who has had some important assignments, could you describe his method of
                    operation and how he worked?</p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, first of all, I've got high respect for Charles Whitehouse. I
                    enjoyed working for him. He's a man of many qualities. He has a wonderful sense
                    of humor. And in terms of his managerial style, I would say it was a very
                    relaxed managerial style in that he was quite willing to let me manage the
                    embassy. But he wanted to be informed, of course, on all matters that he felt
                    should come to his attention. But he would leave that up to the DCM.</p>
                <p>I think he was extremely well-liked by all members of his staff because of his
                    good humor, because of the way he handled meetings and the way he dealt with
                    people on a personal basis. He had, I think, a very good way of dealing with
                    foreign officials as well and people of the government in which he was post, in
                    this case Thailand. There are several—oftentimes you'll run into an American
                    ambassador serving abroad who may have been superb bureaucrats on the Washington
                    level, but they don't always function as effectively in a foreign environment in
                    that they don't sufficiently take into account the customs and the
                    idiosyncrasies of the country and people in which they live. I'd say in
                    Whitehouse's case, he was very sensitive to the local environment, and I think
                    that's one of the reasons he was such an effective ambassador at least while the
                    two of us were together. I think that's about it in terms of him. I guess, it
                    reduces managerial style to wanted always to be kept informed and never wanted
                    to be surprised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were both there at a time when there was a
                        change of government and a coup and all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all view—could you explain sort of what
                        happened and how did you view this? There was an election in April of '76,
                        and then there was a military coup in October of '76. How did the embassy
                        respond, and how did you see the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, actually, he was either on leave or on consultation in Washington at
                    the time of the coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This seems to be the standard operating procedure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BURKE: Yes. I was charg� at the time of the coup. It was a rather remarkable coup
                    in many ways. The government rather lost control of the situation, and it
                    involved students, and there were demonstrations by students in Bangkok. In one
                    case, the students hanged a figure in effigy which looked remarkably like the
                    Crown Prince of Thailand. Now, this produced a very sharp reaction on the part
                    of students in a neighboring institution who were really a trade school as
                    opposed to a university. And they burst into the other campus, and the whole
                    thing began to unravel very quickly.</p>
                <p>The government seemed to be incapable of handling the situation. It began to get
                    badly out of hand, rioting in the center of Bangkok, and the military moved in
                    and took over the government almost with extreme reluctance, and that was it. At
                    least from the point of view of the military, they got control of the situation.
                    There was a certain amount of bloodshed but largely the bloodshed was as a
                    result of the conflicts between the students themselves and not the military
                    against the students or against the populace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did you do? I mean, there you are charg� and
                        there is a coup. What does one do during a coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: What you do at the time of a coup is you try to gather as much information
                    as possible about the contending forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I did it largely through the attach� office. I was really fortunate
                    in that I had an extremely good Army colonel who had been in Thailand for at
                    least a couple of years at that point, and he had excellent connections within
                    the Thai military. So he was able to get first-class information on the
                    situation as it developed. And there was also a Naval attach�, a captain, who
                    had a social relationship with the man who ultimately became head of the coup
                    group, an admiral. And between the two of them, I'd say we had the coup pretty
                    well taped from the beginning in terms of the people involved, what their
                    purposes were and all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, it seemed to me that there was a great reluctance on the
                    part of the military to move in and take charge. They didn't really want to, it
                    seemed to me. I think that's a fair judgement. They did because they felt the
                    situation was beginning to unravel so badly and did take over and did restore
                    order and things calmed down. The monarchy was never threatened, and, of course,
                    the monarchy in Thailand in recent history at least provided the great
                    stabilizing force in terms of the society.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Now, it was interesting in a way, I was quite pleased—if one can say one is
                    pleased—that we had the distraction of a presidential election in the United
                    States almost coincidentally with the coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been with Ford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: This would have been Carter-Ford, yes. And I really felt that if
                    Washington had not been so preoccupied with the presidential election, I would
                    have been receiving instruction of the most detailed sort to get well involved
                    early on and probably in the wrong direction. But as it turned out, I didn't get
                    any such instructions. We just played it the way we saw it, and there wasn't any
                    important U.S. involvement as such. We were monitoring the situation, and it
                    evolved and developed. It produced a situation which was inimical to U.S.
                    interest and regretful though it may have been that the elected government of
                    Kukrit Pramoj was swept aside. It seems that there probably was no other way to
                    go given the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there in Southeast Asia at a rather
                        critical time, too, although it was only for not much more than a year when
                        we were really disassembling what we had in Southeast Asia. Particularly, we
                        were pulling out our bases, weren't we, at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: We had already pulled out our bases, really. We had a very, very small
                    contingent of U.S. in the country left. So the great dismantling had gone on
                    before my arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this leaving any repercussions, economic or
                        politically? I mean, were you feeling among the Thais an unhappiness or were
                        they pleased that we were out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, certain in the government wanted us out and had asked us to leave.
                    The Thai, I think, the ordinary Thai, missed to a certain extent, the economic
                    infusion that the U.S. forces had provided in terms of money and whatnot. But
                    there was enough dynamism within the Thai economy itself so that the slack was
                    picked up in fairly short order after our departure, after we pulled out our
                    bases and our troops. So that the economic downturn was only a slight jolt and
                    not anything profound or important. So I'd say it went well, and in retrospect
                    it was probably a good thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one last question on Thailand. I mean, again, for
                        some years at the height of our involvement, which you were also much
                        concerned, we were talking about the Domino Theory, that if Vietnam went,
                        the rest of Southeast Asia would go. And at the time you were there, I mean,
                        basically Laos and Cambodia had gone. Thailand would have been next on any
                        domino agenda, and it was still at a time of great pressure. Would you say
                        the concept of the domino thing was faulty from the beginning? Or had
                        something changed between the time we were propounding this in the 1960s
                        particularly and the mid-'70s after Vietnam had fallen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: Well, I personally believe the Domino Theory, always have. The difference,
                    of course, was that we had provided the shield for roughly 12 years by our
                    continued presence in Vietnam—the two references points being '63 and '75,
                    really. So that in that time, ASEAN became an important element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ASEAN being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which of course is made up of
                    Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore. And the economies
                    of those individual countries began to move smartly during this time. Certainly
                    the procurement and whatnot by the United States in Thailand helped their
                    economy. But the Thailand I saw in the mid-'50s when I was there the first time
                    and the Thailand of two decades later, just remarkable the self-assurance of the
                    Thai in both the people and the government, really, in terms of being able to
                    handle themselves, that it would have been, say, ten years earlier. So I do feel
                    that if we hadn't hung Vietnam for as long as we did, that the domino process
                    would have taken place, if we had left, say, in '62, '63 or whatever. And
                    Thailand at that stage would have been under great pressure. And of course, the
                    events of China in the meantime and the China of the early '60s was a much more
                    aggressive and maneuvering animal than it was in '73. After all, you already had
                    the Nixon visit and the relationship with the United States was beginning to
                    grow and become important to China. So that it's a completely changed situation
                    in Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are questions we ask of all the people we catch in
                        this program. The first one is a young person comes to you about joining the
                        Foreign Service as a career today, how would you advise them? Is it a good
                        career or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: In my particular case, I feel it was a good career, and I was very
                    fortunate in the series of posts I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But today?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BURKE: Today to go in it's a very different situation. I certainly would not
                    discourage anyone if they knew precisely what they were getting into. Because I
                    still think there are great opportunities in the Foreign Service for qualified
                    people. But they have to know exactly what they want to get into, and I would
                    urge them to specialize almost immediately and set their sights along the way
                    for a series of assignments they really want. If they don't get the assignment
                    they feel they need to build on in order to have a full career, then to get out
                    as early as possible. If they're disappointed anywhere along the way in their
                    first one or two assignments, they shouldn't hang on to the point where, “I feel
                    dead-ended.”</p>
                <p>It's not as good as it was when I came in the Foreign Service. I don't think
                    there's the sense of dedication that I detected in my A-100 course that still
                    prevails today. But there's still important work to be done, and I think
                    talented people can carve out nitches for themselves. I'd encourage people to go
                    in it, but they have to go in with their eyes open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking back on your career, what gave you the
                        greatest sense of a feeling of accomplishment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BURKE: That's a very difficult question for me. I've never been a person who
                    waxes enthusiastic one day and pessimistic the next day. I would guess the most
                    important period was probably the period in Vietnam in the embassy from '63 to
                    '66. I think that we did some really extraordinarily good work in an attempt to
                    try and advise political forces in Vietnam in their efforts to try and put
                    together a representative government. I was impressed with the quality of the
                    Vietnamese I dealt with, their intelligence. And God knows, we had frustrations
                    of many, and in retrospect we didn't do all that well. But it was an important
                    period. We were working six to seven days a week, and we did have some pluses
                    and I'd say that on balance they probably outweighed the minuses. It was an
                    exciting period, and the people I worked with are very high quality people in
                    the embassy in that period.</p>
