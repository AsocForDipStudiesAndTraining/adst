                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 19, 2005; this is an interview with Ralph
                        H. Ruedy. Middle initial N?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: H.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ralph H. Ruedy. What does the H. stand for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Herman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Herman. Ja, that's good Deutsch, echt Deutsch (real
                        German).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY:</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, why don't we start at the beginning? When and where
                        were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start on sort of the Ruedy side. Where did the
                        Ruedys come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I'm originally from Switzerland. When I interviewed for the Foreign
                    Service lo these many years ago we were required to do a little biographical
                    essay. I remember saying in my essay that perhaps it seemed strange that someone
                    who grew up in a very small, rather isolated community in the Midwest speaking
                    German should now be studying for a PhD. in English literature and applying to
                    represent the United States abroad in the Foreign Service. But, that pretty much
                    sums it up. The town that I grew up in is an interesting little community. It
                    was actually established by German Pietists out of the German Baptist tradition,
                    the Amana colonies in Iowa. As I say I grew up there speaking German, learned
                    English in kindergarten and found the small town in Iowa in many ways very, very
                    rewarding. There was also no doubt in my own mind that I wanted to go out and
                    see a wider world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about...what do you know about your
                        father's side of the family. Do you know where they came from or what they
                        were involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes they came from Getlingen in Schaffhausen, Switzerland and joined up
                    with a Baptist or German Pietist group in the late 1700s, early 1800s. They then
                    migrated as a group to the United States so it was a religious community to the
                    United States in about 1840. They established a settlement first in upstate New
                    York, the Ebenezer community. Now I think it is encompassed in the city of
                    Buffalo. Later on, because the city was encroaching they emigrated again as a
                    group to Iowa exactly 150 years ago. In fact, the Amana colonies are celebrating
                    their sesquicentennial of 150 years in Iowa this year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your family...were they basically farmers or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No the predominant enterprise of the community was agriculture but also
                    there was a tradition of textiles and crafts and things like that. They
                    attempted to be a completely self-sufficient, self-sustaining community. My
                    father actually trained as a wagon maker as a young man before he became an
                    insurance agent and established an insurance agency. My grandfather was the
                    storekeeper in the little town there so they existed very much as a
                    self-contained religious community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they, was there any relationship to the Amish or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>RUEDY: No, it comes out of the same religious tradition in Germany, the
                    Mennonites and men who assign themselves as a contemporary I think of Martin
                    Luther so that Anabaptist tradition goes way back to the beginning of the
                    Reformation. They shared I think a lot of the same concerns, a lot of the same
                    theologian quests but there was no formal connection at all. As a matter of
                    fact, I think by their very nature these groups coalesced and split up and
                    coalesced and split up. The Amish splitting off from the Mennonites and then the
                    Church of Brethren in there somewhere and the Hudderites are in there somewhere
                    and all of these various others. So anyway out of that general religious
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did your father...what sort of education did he
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: He had an eighth grade education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was German the language at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of German was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: An interesting German. It's a German dialect; actually it's an
                    amalgamation of various regional dialects in Germany. There were a fair number
                    of sects in this particular part of this group. My own ancestors were from the
                    German speaking area of Switzerland, Schaffhausen, and people from the Rhine
                    valley. So the dialect became an interesting amalgamation of regional dialects.
                    When I served in Germany, I spent a good deal of my Foreign Service career in
                    Germany East and West, and my German, people kept trying to figure out what
                    regional accent it was. They couldn't quite place it. Some people thought maybe
                    it sounded a little bit Bavarian. The Bavarians thought maybe it sounded a
                    little bit Saxon. Some people said, “Oh yes, I hear the Swiss in there.” So it
                    was an interesting combination. They knew it didn't sound like an American
                    accent or like an English accent to German but they couldn't place it
                    regionally, South German generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on your mother's side of the family? Where did
                        they come from and how?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Oh they were from Saxony, Chemnitz, Karl-Marx-Stadt for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, was she part of the...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As part of the religious group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, yes, part of that same group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about schooling for your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Again an eighth grade education, which is what was done at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. Well then let's talk a bit about growing up in
                        this, the town again is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: The Amana colony that is a long story. Let's not get too sidetracked and
                    go way back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way I'm trying to pick out some cultural things.
                        Let's talk about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about it. Being young, I mean how did the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was a very close-knit community; people knew everybody's aunts and
                    uncles, and brothers and sisters going back to generations. Rather isolated is
                    not the word but unique. I think people thought of themselves as being part of a
                    particular community with a particular cultural identity. There was the
                    community and there was the outside, so there was that aspect of it. It was
                    quite small and my high school graduating class I think we had 18. Very Iowa
                    mid-west and all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about schooling? Was there sort of one-room
                        schoolhouses or what was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No I think there were three or four rooms actually. There would be about
                    15-20 people something like that and a basic education. It was a public school
                    obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the teachers come from? Were they from the
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Some were, some weren't. I remember the very dear kindergarten and first
                    grade teachers that I had could not speak any German so there were these kids,
                    not only me but a number of others, who really learned English in kindergarten.
                    I don't recall that as being particularly traumatic, it seemed very natural. I
                    don't recall this being something that “Oh my goodness now people are speaking
                    English or whatever.” It was not something that I feared and the English came
                    naturally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your family? Do you have brothers or
                        sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, I have two older brothers and a younger sister. All three of them are
                    out in the Midwest, my sister and older brother are in Iowa and my other brother
                    is in Minnesota, the Twin Cities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you spend a lot of time working on the farm or helping
                        around or doing chores?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, no, well helping chores around the house and stuff like that. It was
                    just the natural thing to do at age fourteen, fifteen, sixteen to get a summer
                    job. It took care of me during the school vacations and kept me out of mischief.
                    So, yeah I worked in the sales room up the Widow Mill selling blankets and first
                    of all sweeping floors and stocking shelves and things like that and then later
                    also sales. I continued to do that even during college and school holidays when
                    I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in school what particularly interested you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was very interested in reading. I guess I had a lively imagination and I
                    was one of those kids who read a lot. I had kind of a two-track existence. On
                    the one hand books, novels, things like that were very important to me so there
                    was a very lively interior life. On the other hand, I was also pretty outgoing
                    and social, got along with my friends, was a class officer in high school and
                    school paper and boy scouts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you recall any author of books that particularly
                        intrigued you at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I remember reading a lot of Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio
                    and identifying very much with the small town and wanting to get out of the
                    Midwest. I remember reading a lot of Sinclair Lewis and again identifying very
                    much with Sinclair Lewis and getting out of the small towns. I remember some of
                    the Hemingway short stories and the Hemingway novels that I reacted to very
                    strongly and I vividly remember I had a very good high school English teacher. I
                    remember when news came that Hemingway was dead in Idaho, he had committed
                    suicide in Idaho, this affected me. Nobody else was interested in that and that
                    was not something that was on people's scope but I remember tears streaming down
                    the face of my English teacher and thinking well, she understands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How important was the church in your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Pretty important. I was confirmed in the Amana Church and I think the
                    religious dimension, the spiritual dimension was important to me and still is. I
                    am a member now of the Presbyterian Church in Fairfax. We've been members there
                    for the last, oh, twenty years since we first moved back to Washington in the
                    first Washington assignment. We are in the process of getting ready to move to
                    Stanton, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley. There I have been attending,
                    Trinity Episcopal Church which was established in 1742 and which is very high
                    church Anglican or high church Episcopalian. That also is important to me,

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I was wondering whether in your town one always
                        thinks of the preacher dominating and pointing his finger at little children
                        and thou shalt not do this or that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, no, that really wasn't the factor. For me the Pietist tradition and
                    moving toward the association with the spiritual or identifying you know moving
                    towards the spiritual and toward God. That was very much a personal quest and
                    there wasn't a whole lot of 'well this was right way and this was the wrong
                    way.' I never felt that kind of pressure, the kind of thing that one associates
                    with the old time religion and Protestant...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not the “hell fire and damnation”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, no, no not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at home? As you grew up through high school were
                        you sort of plugged in to what was happening around the world and all or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes I was very interested in that. I was born in 1943 and I remember
                    watching the Army-McCarthy hearings on television and being fascinated by that.
                    I remember watching the political campaigns and being fascinated. Television in
                    the 1950s I think was a very different kind of thing than what we have now and
                    television did some very good things. I remember public affairs broadcasting
                    Edward R. Murrow See It Now and for me that was really a connection to a wider
                    world. I remember some of the drama productions that were going on. I remember I
                    didn't know who she was but found out only later that Gisela May, the wonderful
                    interpreter of Brecht music was on one of these cultural Sunday morning programs
                    and I thought that was just fabulous. I remember seeing, again not knowing what
                    it was, Mozart's Don Giovanni and you know really wow. Here it was not the kind
                    of thing that I would get in every day life but there it was on television
                    sometimes. I really, as I say, I really plugged into that. That was important to
                    me.</p>
                <p>Sinclair Lewis, I got into that by a particularly good dramatization of
                    Arrowsmith that I remember seeing on one of these Westinghouse Presents or
                    whatever it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were modern shows...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: They were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which were extremely well done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about you mentioned music. Did you study music?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No not at all. I am completely tone deaf. I like music, I like listening
                    to music but singing or playing an instrument is as out of reach as algebra or
                    the moon. This is not within my reach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm with you. What about politics? Where did the family
                        fall in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Democratic, my dad was for a while a local democratic committeeman. It was
                    sort of post-Roosevelt, New Deal, Harry Truman kind of thing I would say.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that when you were in high school in all you
                        knew you wanted to get the hell, I won't say get the hell out, but to get
                        out which, of course, is sort of the archetypal American story. Did you have
                        any idea of what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No not really. I thought vaguely for a while that I wanted to be a
                    teacher. When it came time to go off to college I knew that I did want to go and
                    in fact both of my brothers and my sister are college graduates. College, even
                    though it wasn't something that was self evident from the standpoint of my
                    parents' education necessarily, it seemed to be something that we wanted to do.
                    So for me there wasn't a whole lot of agonizing of filling out a lot of forms.
                    It was either you were going to the University of Iowa, which was an excellent
                    school about twenty miles down the road, or Iowa State University which was a
                    hundred miles away. I laughed and said I wanted to go far from home so went to
                    Iowa State. Both of my older brothers went to Iowa State so that also I think
                    influenced my decision.</p>
                <p>I went to Iowa State. At that point at a land grant college ROTC (Reserve
                    Officers' Training Corps) was still required for males attending a land grant
                    college. Anyway then the application said to check the box marked Army, Navy or
                    Air Force, which ROTC do you want to be part of? I guess for me Navy sounded
                    most exotic so I checked the box marked Navy and my brother kind of indicated
                    that that might be good too because he had some contact with it. I went off to
                    Iowa State and discovered after I got on campus that one could actually get a
                    scholarship for Navy ROTC and got a ROTC scholarship then which paid my way
                    through school which was real important to me. Then, of course, there was a four
                    year obligation in the Navy afterward. I graduated in 1965 and was commissioned
                    and upon graduation enlisted in the United States Navy and off I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about Iowa State. What were you majoring
                        in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was a history major. It had a very good history department and a good
                    English department too. I took some good, good courses from excellent
                    professors. We were almost a little liberal arts enclave for the engineers and
                    scientists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your parents? How much of a roll did they have
                        in getting you to go on to further your education and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Oh that is hard to say. I think they encouraged it but I think at that
                    point I thought well you know these decisions are decisions that are really ones
                    that I'm going to have to make if I can. So, I guess they weren't looking over
                    my shoulder very much so I didn't really look to them very much I don't think
                    for guidance and advice in that regard. They were interested but I was kind of
                    on my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Iowa State like in the early '60s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was very conservative. I joined a fraternity, social fraternity. Every
                    Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday we dressed for dinner which meant a suit and tie
                    and you threw on your coat and tie five minutes before dinner and dressed like
                    that but we did that. The sororities and the girls' dormitories had hours and
                    they had to be in by midnight or one, or whatever, and it was very conservative.
                    I graduated in, as I say, 1965, went off into the Navy and spent most of the
                    next five years abroad. I arrived on the Duke campus then for graduate school in
                    January, 1970 and it was like an Alice in Wonderland. Hopefully it was not the
                    campus, this is not the college life that I remembered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Navy? Did you have a specialty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No. I went in as a ship driver, an eleven hundred surface line officer,
                    and did a tour aboard a destroyer, the USS Joseph P. Kennedy. I put in for a
                    ship that sort of guaranteed that I was going to go off to sea duty, that was a
                    given. I put in for a destroyer or small combatant based in New England because
                    I always thought New England would be kind of interesting to see and was
                    assigned to the Kennedy in Newport, Rhode Island. The Kennedy, I tell people
                    that the wonderful ship of the line, the proud ship of the line in which I
                    served as an officer is now in a Naval museum. It was one of the few World War
                    II destroyers that was not ground up for razor blades or whatever. It was
                    preserved because of the Kennedy name and is now in Fall River, Massachusetts,
                    along with the battleship the USS Massachusetts, a submarine and a couple of
                    other ships, a little complex of Navy museums. So the Kennedy still exists and I
                    spent close to two years on board as communications officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? Was sort of duty was the Kennedy
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: We were straight destroyers so we served a lot with aircraft carriers and
                    task forces. I came on board the ship just as it was coming out of the Navy yard
                    in Boston, Massachusetts, and spent a couple of weeks in Boston and then we went
                    to Newport and then down to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training. It was
                    pretty rigorous getting the ship into shape again after the period in the repair
                    yards. Then we did a tour in the Mediterranean with the Sixth Fleet working
                    mostly with the attack carriers as part of the attack carrier task forces all in
                    the Cold War stuff, with Soviet destroyers, you know, two miles away and so on.
                    We did a couple of cruises way out in the mid-Atlantic toward the south Atlantic
                    as stocking vessels as Gemini launches so if they had to go to a landing,
                    overshot a primary landing site you were supposed to be out there in the middle
                    of nowhere to team up and pick them up. It was some interesting stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you like the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: One is not supposed to like the Navy and we complained a lot as junior
                    officers do; but I feel it was a liberating experience for me because I think it
                    opened up a wider world. Here were guys from hotshot universities and the Naval
                    Academy and one thing or another and I was from a small town in Iowa state and I
                    thought, “Gee, I can do this.” For me it was a good experience, very good, and I
                    still keep contacts with people that I knew on board the Kennedy because it was
                    a very tense and really a unique experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is several years after the Cuban Missile Crisis. Were
                        you feeling that war could start at any time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, not in the sense of the Cuban Missile Crisis but we were up there and
                    it was for real. As communications officer I was involved in the authentications
                    systems for nuclear weapons, which the ship was capable of carrying. We had an
                    ASROC (Anti-Submarine ROCket) system, anti-submarine system, and the official
                    line on that was that it was capable of launching a nuclear depth charge.
                    Whether or not they were on board at any given time was a deep dark secret but
                    the capability was there and that involved the whole communications rigmaroles
                    and, oh, this was for real. When I looked out at the Russian trawler a mile away
                    in the Mediterranean in the middle of our carrier task force you thought, well,
                    you know this is for real.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But when you were in the Mediterranean I take it you, the
                        Sixth Fleet was always putting into ports weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Not enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean how did this taste of the world suit you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Very much, very much. That I found just really riveting and fascinating. I
                    enjoyed the port visits. Between my junior and senior year of college I did a
                    Mediterranean training cruise as part of the ROTC program. I was fortunate
                    enough, to get a cruise in the Mediterranean. So I served as a midshipman first
                    class for six weeks aboard the USS Bainbridge, which was a brand new nuclear
                    destroyer. A nuclear-powered frigate. There were a number of port visits and
                    after that we had the wonderful opportunity of traveling around Europe for a
                    while. There were about three weeks when I could travel around with some friends
                    and that was incredible, that was great, that was just a wonderful, wonderful
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you consider while you were in the Navy of making it a
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Not really. I think if I could go around a couple or two or three more
                    times in life then maybe a Naval career is one that I would do; but, no, when it
                    came time to get out of the Navy I knew that I was kind of torn between law
                    school and graduate school in English literature. I had been a history major as
                    an undergraduate and had some really good literature courses during my junior
                    and senior year and decided that I would try English literature. I was on the
                    Kennedy for about a year and a half, after that I was assigned to Vietnam. I
                    would not have volunteered for Vietnam, they couldn't have paid me enough to do
                    that. But when I got orders to Vietnam I thought, “Well, what the hell, this is
                    what's going on in the world.” I almost felt like, “Well, no, might as well if
                    that is what is going on, that is what I will do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I had a great job. I was assigned to the intelligence staff of Naval
                    Forces Headquarters in Saigon. We had Navy liaison officers up and down the
                    coast and through the Mekong Delta and part of my job was to work with these
                    Naval intelligence liaison officers. So I had a big stack of travel orders that
                    basically said let this guy on any airplane or ship to travel to wherever he
                    feels he needs to go. I traveled around quite a lot through Vietnam through the
                    coastal areas of I CORPS and II CORPS and then in the coast in through the
                    Mekong Delta where Naval operating forces were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of our presence in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Wow, that was interesting. When I went there was still a lot of idealism.
                    I came out of this whole John F. Kennedy, bear any burden and all this stuff. I
                    was very enthusiastic about that and the anti-war movement really hadn't gotten
                    started at all when I got orders to Vietnam. Even out in California when I was
                    training to go over and we were still I think filled with a lot of idealism and
                    we were reading the, what was it, Bernard Fall and doing all...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Street Without Joy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Street Without Joy, exactly, exactly, yes, yes. So I think we went over
                    with still lots of idealism and this was part of the whole engagement with
                    communism and protecting this small country from blah, blah, blah. When I got
                    over there, I think my experience was mirrored by a lot of others who had
                    thought, “Oh man, this does not compute, this just does not fit, this isn't
                    working.” It was a period, I won't say I went through a lot of soul searching,
                    or agonizing as some others did, but I knew that it wasn't what it was cracked
                    up to be and it wasn't working. I was over there through the Tet offensive in
                    Saigon. Afterwards man you were coming up with contingency plans to do this,
                    that and the other, increase the American military presence, more Navy forces
                    where would you put them, what would they do? Then it all kind of fizzled very
                    quickly within a period of a couple of weeks. I remember it was not long before
                    I left Saigon I remember listening at the Navy headquarters. A couple of us were
                    there in the office listening to Armed Forces Radio and Television and President
                    Johnson's speech at nine o'clock at night in DC and it was nine o'clock in the
                    morning in Saigon. He indicated that he would not run for reelection and the
                    peace talks would begin again. There was a gut feeling by a lot of us that we
                    are out of here on the best terms that we can get but we are out of here. This
                    is a lost cause and we are going to turn it over on the best terms we can get
                    but our time here is over and this war is not going to be won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about your experiences during Tet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was based in Cholon, I was living at a BOQ (Bachelor's Officers
                    Quarters) in Cholon which was about a mile and a half from the office in Saigon,
                    right downtown in Saigon not far from the Embassy. Initially on the morning of
                    Tet it was hard to know what was going on. There were a lot of fireworks and it
                    was the Tet holiday after all so we were expecting lots of fireworks but then we
                    began thinking, man, this is not fireworks, this is machineguns. The pattern
                    didn't sound like fireworks and it clearly wasn't, but there was no fighting in
                    Cholon where we were particularly. The fighting was going on in Saigon around
                    the Embassy and lots of other places downtown, but in Cholon it was all pretty
                    quiet. I mean everything was on edge and stuff like that, you didn't know what
                    was going to happen. On the first day we did not try to make it into the office,
                    we were told not to come because there was nothing we could do. Just lie low and
                    stay in place. We didn't go in the second day, I think I forget but pretty soon
                    we needed to get into headquarters. So we went in a jeep, but we never got shot
                    at as far as I know of. I remember there was one hotshot major who was staying
                    in the BOQ who told me, “Man you're going in, this is stupid.” He went in the
                    next day to his headquarters at MACV (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam) and
                    took a road that I would not have taken. Their jeep was hit by machinegun fire
                    and all four of them in the jeep were killed. I came in that night to the BOQ
                    and they were cleaning out his locker and putting it into a duffle bag and
                    sending it home, so you never knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Commander of Naval Forces when you were in
                        there, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Oh, let's see, I forget who the Admiral was, it was a two star admiral but
                    later on it was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zumwalt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Zumwalt came later on. I was not there when Zumwalt was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I dealt with him very briefly. Did you get any feel for
                        our riverine operations while you were doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, we worked with attack force 117 which was based on an LST (Landing
                    Ship Tank) in the Delta and they had these big converted LCMs (Landing Craft,
                    Medium). They ferried boats up and down canals and they were working with an
                    army of light infantry brigades as I recall. I worked pretty closely with the
                    Intel guys because they were looking for aerial photography to figure out what
                    canals they could go through and what they couldn't and figure out the depth of
                    water and stuff. I remember thinking at the time, geeze this is sort of nuts
                    because these guys get into their boats and they have this hell of a planking
                    and they go and if somebody wants to shoot at them they can. If they don't want
                    to shoot at them, they just melt back into the reeds and nobody every knows they
                    are there. So it did not strike me as a terribly smart way to fight the war
                    because doing a big sweep like I say, it was kind of engaging on the VC's (Viet
                    Cong) terms. Down in the delta it was pretty much all Viet Cong and there wasn't
                    much North Vietnamese army activity down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '68, were you getting reflections from home or
                        with your own colleagues about the war protests or anything like that? Were
                        you aware of the depth of unhappiness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I became aware of that and all of this was a kind of surreal among young
                    Navy officers who were sort of wise guys and stuff like that but I remember we
                    did an Intel brief when all of the violence was going on in Washington, DC. We
                    sort of put the Intel brief into the kind of clich� context of engaging the bad
                    guys and this, that and the other and then we were talking about the situation
                    in DC. So yeah, we became aware of it. I finished reading the biography of
                    Kerry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is John Kerry.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, Tour of Duty, talking about his Vietnam experience and he was there a
                    little bit later than I was. I think he got there at about the time I was
                    leaving and did some of the same things though like riding the boats around and
                    the training in San Diego so a lot of that is very familiar. Kerry obviously
                    became very politicized and then came back and was really interested in getting
                    involved in anti-war activities. I didn't. When I left Vietnam I still had some
                    time to go on my Navy tour, my four years of obligated service and they were
                    giving people out of Vietnam pretty much instead your choice of duty. I knew at
                    that point I didn't want to make the Navy a career so I was interested in being
                    a department head of a destroyer so I put in for shore duty in continental
                    Europe and got assigned to Naples, Italy. I was in Naples, Italy, for my last
                    year in the Navy and enjoyed Italy. That was most of '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Naples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was with the Naval Support activity, which supported the operating units
                    in the Sixth Fleet. It was 9-5 and there was no BOQs, I had an apartment in
                    Posillipo overlooking the Bay of Naples. It was a very different kind of life
                    from the way I had been viewing it before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, I can't remember, were you engaged? Married?
                        Or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>RUEDY: No. I was single and then left Italy in let's see December of 1969, sort
                    of a symmetry there, the end of the 1960s and I had with my Navy savings, most
                    of it I was saving for graduate school because I knew I wanted to go on to grad
                    school at that point. I had applied to a number of graduate schools and was
                    interested still in the big cities in the Northeast. I had been accepted to
                    Boston University in the English department so I was very excited at the
                    prospect of starting at Boston University. Then, after my four years of
                    obligated service, I should say it was going to expire four years after
                    graduation in June of '69 and I was going to start at Boston in September of
                    '69. Then it turned out that the Navy involuntarily extended all officers in my
                    year group or whatever, they were still trying to figure out what was happening
                    in Vietnam. So anyway that meant that I could not start graduate school in
                    September, I was going to have to stay in the Navy. Initially the extension was
                    going to be for a year, then they cut the extension to six months which meant I
                    would be getting out in December instead of June and I could not start the
                    Boston University program in January, the beginning of the spring semester. But
                    Duke where I had also been accepted they let me start the program at the
                    beginning of the semester, so I decided that I wouldn't go to Boston University
                    but I would go to Duke instead. I left Naples in early December of '69. I had
                    bought with my savings a Fiat Sports Spider back in '69 which I could ship, cost
                    free, space available on military ships and there weren't many going out of the
                    Mediterranean. I was told that if you took it to Bremerhaven, Germany, they have
                    these things going back and forth all the time to Bayonne, New Jersey. So I got
                    into my Fiat Sports Spider and drove it to Bremerhaven, Germany, dropped it off
                    there and spent a couple more weeks in Paris, London and Amsterdam. I then flew
                    back to the United States, spent Christmas with my parents, my family in Iowa
                    and then flew out to Bayonne, New Jersey, picked up my Fiat Sports Spider
                    convertible and headed south on I-95 (Interstate 95) to who knows what would
                    await me in graduate school at Duke in North Carolina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to graduate school in Duke from what 1970
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I started in January of '70 and was in the middle of my dissertation in
                    '74 when I took the Foreign Service exam. At the time assistant professorships
                    were very, very few and far between. The job market had suddenly contracted
                    drastically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>RUEDY: And everybody was looking, gee what else can I do with a degree in English
                    Lit? I don't know why, I guess I vaguely remembered the Foreign Service. My wife
                    and I had also talked about it and both of us were interested in living abroad.
                    I met Shirley, my first semester in graduate school and we were married the
                    following summer. I think both of us were kind of intrigued with the idea of
                    living abroad so I took the Foreign Service exam. It was free and I didn't have
                    anything else going on that Saturday and went to the Durham post office and one
                    thing lead to another and came into the Foreign Service to USIA (U.S.
                    Information Agency) since my background was in more cultural side I figured
                    that's where I would be most at home or had the most to offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you during your time in college, the Navy, had any
                        contact or interest in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Not as such. I really didn't know that much about it. In Naples I do
                    remember going once to a program at the American Cultural Center and I don't
                    know what got me there and I don't really remember that much about it, I think
                    it was a lecture on T.S. Elliott, or an American poet, I forget, but I got up to
                    that cultural center which I think has since been closed, I know it's been
                    closed, and thought man, this is not bad, it is kind of an interesting thing to
                    do. In graduate school also I had applied for a Fulbright junior lectureship, as
                    something to do since as I say assistant professorships were few and far
                    between, so that kind of oriented me in that direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a Fulbright?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, I think that I was still in the process when the whole Foreign Service
                    thing was developing, I forget how that worked. I'm not even sure that I sent in
                    my application but I was interested in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your dissertation going to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was, I did finish it later on and got the degree. I was in the middle
                    of it when they called and asked if I would be interested in accepting the
                    appointment to the Foreign Service. This would have been in late '73 and by that
                    time I had done my prelims and I was well into dissertation research and was
                    really beginning to write. At that point I asked whether it would be possible to
                    delay coming into the Foreign Service six months until after I had finished my
                    dissertation. “Well, you know we have enough money this fiscal year to accept
                    the class of so many and your name now is at the head of the rank order and next
                    year we don't know how much money we will have or even whether we will even have
                    an entering class and we will have new people in the rank order.” None of that
                    meant much to me but the bottom line was if you are interested in the Foreign
                    Service, we would advise you to come in now, which I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I then took a leave of absence after my first Foreign Service tour and went back
                    to finish up my dissertation, which was on Ford Madox Ford in The English Review
                    which was a literary magazine published in London in 1908, 1909. It involved
                    lots of people some, of whom were already famous, many of whom became famous
                    later on. Ford Madox Ford was the editor, he was working closely with H.G.
                    Wells, he was a young novelist at the time. He discovered the poetry of D.H.
                    Lawrence who was doing teaching in the English midlands and his girlfriend sent
                    off poetry to The English Review and they said bring him to London. Ezra Pound
                    had just appeared on the scene in London and he was involved. Henry James who
                    was an established novelist and a serious figure obviously contributed a couple
                    of excellent short stories. Joseph Conrad also by that time was a major figure
                    did some important work for The English Review so it brought together a lot of
                    people. It got them all mad at one another, which was interesting too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall when you took the oral exam; do you recall
                        any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Not really, no. If I remember the preliminary exam was pretty rough. There
                    they were really trying I think to make sure that you were ready to move on to a
                    dissertation. The dissertation defense I mean by that time you had done the
                    dissertation and your doctoral dissertation adviser had been working with you
                    and I think there, it was just sort of assumed that if this dissertation could
                    not be defended you'd never get to the defense. So the defense was more
                    congenial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were applying for the Foreign Service where did
                        you take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: At the Durham, North Carolina, post office. I do remember this is a story
                    that I've told a couple of times. There was an English professor, a good, good
                    guy who was my Shakespeare professor ran into me as I was carrying my doctoral
                    notes on dissertation stuff out of the library and getting ready for the big
                    move to Washington, DC. He was as I say an interesting, congenial fellow and he
                    looked at me and he thought I had some promise in an academic career and he
                    looked over his glasses at me as I was carrying out my boxes of dissertation
                    notes at the back steps of the Perkins Library and said, “Mr. Ruedy I understand
                    you are going to be leaving us. Tell me all about this decision that you have
                    made.” I explained about the Foreign Service, having taken the Foreign Service
                    exam and now going to Washington to begin a year of diplomatic service. Then he
                    looked again over his glasses and kind of peered down at me and said, “And Mr.
                    Ruedy is this the sort of thing for which you wish to be congratulated?” I don't
                    know how I reacted, I know later on I wish I would have said, “Well I'm not sure
                    that I should be congratulated but wish me luck.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me a bit about, I realize as a grad student you
                        lived a life apart from campus life but what was, how did you find Duke
                        during those four years in the '70s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: In retrospect, of course, knowing how things came out, that I would pass
                    and the dissertation, which I had written, and stuff like that it seems a lot
                    more tranquil than maybe it was. There is a great deal of stress in graduate
                    school and here I was coming out of Iowa State and four years completely away
                    from an academic environment stepping into a fairly high-powered graduate
                    program like the one at Duke and wondering am I in the right place? Am I going
                    to make it? Is this really what I am cut out to do? So, yeah, a certain amount
                    of apprehension and in graduate school it is a total immersion experience,
                    there's no getting around it, everybody that I knew really had to plug at it.
                    There were no freebies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is at the height of a lot of unrest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Of yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that going on at the Duke campus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Very much so, very much so. There were takeovers of the main
                    administration building; there were bonfires in the traffic circle and all that
                    kind of stuff. As a graduate student I was relatively aloof from that I think I
                    didn't participate in it. Some graduate students did, I didn't. I was still
                    interestingly enough getting money doing maybereserve duty so I would put on my
                    Navy uniform once a week and drive to Raleigh, North Carolina, and do my little
                    Navy reserve. That was good money and I would put on my black Navy raincoat over
                    my dress whites and get into my car. But it was not something I talked a lot
                    about, it hadn't bothered me particularly, certainly I was never hassled at all.
                    There were a few people who knew that I was in the Navy reserve and nobody every
                    hassled me about it, it was no big deal.</p>
                <p>I did later on some of the protests were still going on when I was doing teaching
                    as an assistantship. I was teaching some freshman literature courses, a course
                    in a novel and I remember one semester when I forget what was going on. It was
                    at the closing stages of the war when there was still a lot of controversy and I
                    substituted that wonderful book by Graham Greene The Quiet American for whatever
                    had been on my reading list. The Quiet American I think is a wonderful,
                    wonderful book and it sums up the idealism and ambiguity and the very tough
                    moral choices. The movie was awful but I think the book was just tremendous. It
                    really I thought is still the best thing that I read on Vietnam and I was
                    interested in how the students would respond to it and they didn't really
                    respond to it very much. Their minds were kind of made up and this one student
                    she wrote 'moral ambiguity, what the hell is this about. War is wrong and we
                    should get out and stop the bombing and they're killing babies.' It was kind of
                    disappointing. These were bright kids.</p>

                        Service in '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: January of '74. That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your basic officer course? Can you talk a little
                        bit about the people in it and how it was taught?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, I came into USIA and there were six of us who came into USIA with
                    that intern class. We had some courses at USIA headquarters, which at the time
                    was on 1776 Pennsylvania Avenue just down the street from the White House. Most
                    of what we did was done in conjunction with our State Department colleagues in
                    the A-100 class at the Foreign Service Institute at the time in Rosslyn, one of
                    those awful Rosslyn high-rises. It was an interesting time because it was the
                    Watergate hearings and there were demonstrations at the White House and
                    Lafayette Park so during the lunch hour I could walk down and watch the
                    demonstrations and see this whole thing building and all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was your class and what was the composition of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: In our group coming into USIA we were an interesting group and we went off
                    in different directions. There were two, three women, were there three women or
                    two women, I have forgotten now and two black guys and an Asian guy and
                    different backgrounds, interesting backgrounds. They were bright people. I liked
                    them, people coming from different directions, different parts of the country,
                    different experiences. The State people that we worked with I think at that
                    point oh how many were there, probably 25 or 30 I forget exactly I think maybe a
                    third of them were women so there were a fair number of women officers that were
                    coming into the State Department at that point as well. They all felt I think
                    that they were doing something new and different and unique and they were
                    because I don't think it was really too far back that those career options
                    weren't available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no I mean just years before if you were a woman and
                        got married you had to get out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes. Ambassador Thomas Pickering's wife was in that category. She said she
                    was with USIA and then met Ambassador Pickering. They were married and that was
                    the end of her Foreign Service career. She told me that she had done Fourth of
                    July receptions as the Ambassador's wife in, I don't know, twenty times, fifteen
                    times. He served such a long and distinguished and wonderful career and she was
                    very much a part of that. But yeah, when woman married that was the end of their
                    career.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were getting the USIA training and all was there
                        sort of a dividing line and all about whether you would go into sort of the
                        press field or the cultural field or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: A little bit but not much. The first assignment was sort of information
                    and cultural anyway so I didn't worry too much about that at the time. My
                    initial assignment, USIA had a wonderful program at the time, which
                    unfortunately went by the board. I think it was a best practices thing where you
                    were actually sent as a junior officer trainee. You were an extra officer at a
                    post and you rotated through different embassy sections so I did a stint on my
                    first assignment in Tehran as a political officer for a month and that was
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '70-? In Tehran, Iran from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Well let's see I would have gotten there in the fall of '74 and would have
                    been there until the summer of '76 I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was Iran like? How did it strike you when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It reminded me in some ways of Vietnam. There was this sort of mental
                    construct of what was happening in the country. When I went the Shah had been on
                    the cover of Time and Newsweek and Iran was moving to become a European power
                    within a generation or within a few decades. The oil money was pouring in and
                    there was modernization and women were entering the mainstream and there was
                    lots of stuff that was out there and then when you got there and looked around
                    you thought this doesn't compute. This is a little like the Vietnam experience
                    where when you got there you thought, Jesus, this is just not working out the
                    way I learned back in DC. I had very much that same feeling in Iran thinking
                    that this is not coming out the way my Time and Newsweek story said it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the first, the political section? What
                        did they give you to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I did an interesting report on student unrest. There was an annual student
                    holiday the 15th of Azar and this was, according to the Persian calendar, a date
                    for great demonstrations and an anti-government, often violence and smashing of
                    windows and so on. So I set out to find out what the hell the 15th of Azar was
                    all about. It was interesting because the more you got into it the more it sort
                    of disappeared into the myths of history. There were concerns that at some point
                    there had been a shooting by the Shah's policemen of students on the Tehran
                    University campus, but exactly where and when they got shot was impossible to
                    exactly...but as I say it kind of dissipated. You couldn't really put your
                    finger on it but everybody knew the 15th of Azar was a big deal and there would
                    be violence on campus and it would be anti-government and there would be windows
                    smashed and there might be some shooting and God knows it would be awful but
                    nobody ever could figure out exactly what the specific historical basis was for
                    this particular event. It was very Persian, a kind of the more you got into it
                    the more difficult it was to exactly define what you were dealing with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do? Did you go out in the campus or could
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Not much. I did a bunch of interviews and things like that. Shirley had a
                    much more interesting time of it there because she was a faculty member of
                    Tehran National University and she may have talked about that. You talk to
                    faculty members and you talk to some students but not many and you know more
                    faculty and sort of westernized Iranians and it was a lot of stuff going on. I
                    was there for just 18 months as a junior officer trainee and we had a wonderful
                    old gentleman who was a senior cultural adviser with USIS (U.S. Information
                    Service). He was French educated from an old family, very plugged in and really
                    knew Persian society and could quote you Ferdowsi and Hafiz. He was really just
                    a wonderful, wonderful guy. Very plugged into the politics as well. He invited
                    Shirley and me to a wonderful Persian lunch the last week that we were there and
                    it was a long lunch and great Persian hospitality and it was just very cultural,
                    it was just a wonderful experience. He began talking about how things were going
                    in Iran. He said that he feared that the day was coming when in Tehran no
                    American would be safe and at the time that seemed like a very weird...we knew
                    things weren't going well but that seemed like a very far out prediction. Of
                    course, he was absolutely right on within a number of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there were you picking up some...in a large
                        embassy there is always sort of an establishment the ambassador and heads of
                        section and all of that, more senior officers. The junior officers often
                        have quite a different attitude towards things and a little bit iconoclastic
                        and all. Did you get the feeling from your fellow junior officers that we
                        were maybe too close to the Shah or snuggling up to him or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, I think so. There were some good people over there. I remember Henry
                    Kreist who later on you know was much involved in the hostage crisis, a great
                    guy, he was in the political section. I remember I worked immediately with Stan
                    Escudero who later on went to be ambassador in a number of countries, a fluent
                    Persian speaker. I was doing my little paper on the 15th of Azar for Stan who
                    was at that point a second or third tour political officer. I think all of us
                    figured things weren't going well but he didn't really know, I didn't know, in
                    what direction it was going to go. I think that most of our contacts were with
                    more Western oriented liberal types who I think envisioned a far different
                    future for Iran than the one that actually transpired. In looking back on it I
                    think there were lots and lots of groups jockeying for power. I think the one
                    thing they all had in common was we've got to get rid of the Shah and when we
                    get rid of the Shah we will make our move and we will establish the kind of
                    thing that we want to establish. That applied certainly to these western
                    oriental liberal types who were more interested in a western social democracy
                    kind of thing. It applied I think to the more traditional merchant class, the
                    Bazaaries they were called, who were more interested in no, not this much of a
                    military hardware and more of a traditional Persian society. It applied probably
                    to the communists and they were certainly around the Tudeh party was in the
                    background you know very much a factor. It applied obviously to the religious
                    fundamentalists and they weren't on our scope as much and they certainly weren't
                    on my scope very much and they were the ones who of course outmaneuvered them
                    all. I think the hostage crisis was obviously part of that. By the time the
                    crisis was over Khomeini was firmly in charge and his people who were involved
                    in the churning immediately after the revolution, the Bazargans, the Ghotbzadehs
                    and various others were dead or were in Paris or wherever. So the hostage crisis
                    was kind of outmaneuvering all those people in establishing this new
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in what was it '76 or '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: When was it? It would have been '76 I guess it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other sections did you work in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I worked in the consular section for a while and that was an education.
                    That was important to me because I did visa work for about a month and a half on
                    student visas. Later on working as a USIA officer on student issues and stuff, I
                    mean the whole study abroad business and you know how people got interested in
                    studying in the United States doing those interviews on the visa line that was
                    important to have had that experience.</p>
                <p>I spent a month, too, working in the economic section and there oil was obviously
                    the thing. It was good training that I benefited from a lot in my later career
                    with USIA. It was a good program. I'm sorry State did not adopt that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in USIA work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, very much so. I did my embassy rotation which was about four months
                    altogether and then I was an information officer type, assistant information
                    officer type, at USIS in Tehran and worked with some wonderful people. People
                    who were really, really sharp and went on to make great careers, were themselves
                    second and third tour officers at the time and formed friendships that I
                    continue to value. I haven't seen much of them lately but you know you run into
                    them and everybody in the Foreign Service is familiar with this, somebody you
                    haven't seen in years and then an elevator door suddenly opens and here you are
                    and you pick up as if you never left it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work did you get involved in on the
                        information side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: We had a film program going on at the time and we were involved in that.
                    We were doing press summaries, press releases, summaries of the daily press
                    which I would audit, edit, and send back to Washington. Also involved with the
                    cultural center. We had a big cultural center in Tehran, a big English language
                    program and many, many, many students that studied English at the American
                    cultural center. That was right down by the university. If there was a
                    demonstration at the embassy, classes would go right on at the cultural center
                    and it was interesting. The cultural center was a major thing in Tehran. We had
                    done big art exhibits. I remember we had a big exhibit of Paul Strand the
                    photographer. Louise Nevelson came over and did a lecture and stayed for her
                    opening. We had wonderful exhibits by Louise Nevelson; that was before she
                    became rich and famous I guess, but anyway good, good stuff that was going on
                    there. A film night that they did, I think they showed films three or four
                    nights a week in packed auditoriums, it was very much a presence on the scene. A
                    good thing I think, a good thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many contacts with Iranians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, quite a few. I got to know a number of people especially younger
                    faculty members in the English department. Some of Shirley's colleagues from the
                    university became mutual friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there when? Say in '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I left there in '75 and then I did a six month leave of absence to go back
                    and finish up my dissertation. I left Tehran and at that point I had orders to
                    Kabul, Afghanistan. People were telling me what a wonderful assignment I had in
                    Kabul and for a second tour officer to be assigned as center director in Kabul,
                    Afghanistan, was a wonderful, wonderful thing and a real coup and I would love
                    it. I gave them to understand in personnel that while this was interesting I
                    nevertheless really would be interested in possibly serving in Germany, Europe,
                    and went off to do my leave without pay at Duke to finish up my doctoral
                    dissertation.</p>
                <p>I had a six months leave of absence and I was told, in the summer of '76 that
                    definitely I could not plan on any additional time. Six months was all I had,
                    then I would need to go on to my next assignment. OK that was part of the deal
                    and I went and got settled in Durham and was beginning to do my writing on the
                    dissertation. Suddenly the telephone rang and the people at USIA personnel were
                    suddenly on the phone asking if perhaps I would be interested in having my
                    assignment to Kabul cancelled and being assigned to a new position which had
                    been established at the American embassy to the German Democratic Republic in
                    East Berlin. They needed somebody on fairly short notice and I already had
                    German. And I should recognize that if I took this assignment it absolutely
                    meant finishing and going out to post in December. I said, “OK, if that is part
                    of the deal I would love to go to East Berlin.” So I finished up my
                    dissertation, felt under a great deal of pressure to grind it out and to finish
                    it up but I did and I went off to East Berlin then in January 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in East Berlin from '77 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Until '80. It was a two-year assignment and I extended for a third year so
                    I was actually there for almost three and a half years to get into the summer
                    cycle. I got there in January I guess it was and left in the summer of 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: David Bolen. Yeah, I think that was who it was; he was there the entire
                    time that I was there. I don't think he had arrived yet when I arrived. The
                    previous ambassador who was, oh what was the guys' name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Sherman Cooper?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly. John Sherman Cooper had left. He was much beloved and he was an
                    older statesman type out of the political sphere and he had opened the embassy,
                    had been the first ambassador and then David Bolen who was a career Foreign
                    Service type came into it and he was there as ambassador. He hadn't served in
                    Europe very much, I don't think at all maybe as a junior officer and most of his
                    career I think had been in Africa and here he was in East Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations with East Germany when you arrived
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Pretty tough. The East Germans, well it was all post-Helsinki and it was
                    all very complicated. I think some wonderful imaginative diplomacy had gone in
                    to the Helsinki Agreement and then the Berlin Four Power Agreement and the
                    Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin, which made a sort of diplomatic presence by
                    the West Germans possible in East Berlin and vice versa. We couldn't do very
                    much and we couldn't move, well we could move around freely. We had free access
                    to move around but we were very closely watched and monitored. It was never
                    obtrusive but it was tough, it was tough in many ways but fascinating. It was a
                    wonderful assignment and I thought it was a great assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was the second person in a two-man press and cultural operation and
                    initially I was much involved in moving into the new embassy. We established a
                    little library in the new embassy. The whole question of public access was a
                    big, big deal if the people, the East Germans, would actually be allowed to,
                    would dare to come into the embassy. We hung up our sign and everybody was
                    welcome but would they come? Getting the library set up, starting a program on
                    film weeks, once a week where we invited audiences to come and, you know, chat
                    them up. There were people from all different walks of whatever, officialdom and
                    nonofficialdom, some people from the official sanctioned cultural community,
                    other people that you've met and you never quite knew whether who you met was
                    who they said they were. It was all a through the looking glass parade kind of
                    experience. But it was a great assignment. We worked a lot with the GDR version
                    of FSI (Foreign Service Institute). They did “studies” for the East German
                    foreign ministry. They were very interested in getting a sense of what the
                    Americans really thought and we would bring in American academics and some
                    fairly high-powered folks. Bill Griffith from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology) was a guy that they listened to very closely and lots of other
                    people too. People were interested; East Berlin was still pretty exotic for them
                    so you know we would bring over some amazing people. We would go over to West
                    Berlin and then I would escort them through Checkpoint Charlie and do this whole
                    theology routine about how do you get through the checkpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You show the passport on the window but...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But don't lower the window.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly, there was a real; well you are familiar with the theology that
                    developed around that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never served there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: We were the American embassy to the “German Demokratic Republik” (German
                    Democratic Republic) not in the “German Demokratic Republik” because our
                    building was located in the Soviet Sector of the Four Power occupied city of
                    Berlin. So as I say we were the “Amerikanische Botschaft” (American Embassy)
                    what did we say “bei de Deutsche Demokratische Republik” and everything that we
                    sent out was from the American embassy to the German Democratic Republic. Stuff
                    that they sent to us would be to the American Embassy in the German Democratic
                    Republic because they were trying to assert their sovereignty claim to the city
                    of East Berlin, and that got very complicated and sometimes interesting. I
                    remember the very first art exhibit that we did. It was a modest show, actually
                    in retrospect not so modest, it was a good, good photographer. A photographer,
                    Paul Strand, and we did a Paul Strand exhibit in East Berlin and we worked with
                    the GDR Ministry of Culture on this exhibit. There were some long negotiations
                    about what museum it would be in; they were interested in showing their
                    openness, cultural engagement with the west without really doing it in a safe
                    way in a measured way. So anyway we got a great venue for it, the Yatis “Museem”
                    (museum) in Berlin and they did great posters for us. But the posters said 'with
                    this exhibit of Paul Strand, in the “Berlinhauptstadt GDR” (Berlin capital
                    city). That was one word as far as they were concerned “Berlinhauptstadt GDR”
                    Berlin capital of the German Democratic republic. We, of course, insisted that
                    Berlin, East Berlin, was the Soviet sector. So big deal if these posters go up
                    the exhibit goes down, can't do it under those circumstances. This was
                    non-negotiable as far as we were concerned. They damn well should have known it
                    was non-negotiable, this was basic, this was basic to the whole QA (question and
                    answer) to the whole approach. We knew where their red lines were and they knew
                    where our red lines were. Anyway if this exhibit goes up or if this poster goes
                    up the exhibit goes down. Anyway they came up with a nice poster that said “The
                    Museem________ in Berlin” and it was OK as far as we were concerned so the
                    posters went up, I have a copy of the poster at home and the exhibit was a
                    tremendous success and it was one of the first things that we had done to engage
                    culture with the GDR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you find, I mean, did you find that culture
                        was a solid way to open up relations with the GDR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, I think so. I think we did a lot of good in retrospect. A lot of
                    these people even people at the Institute for International Affairs or what was
                    the “Institute for Politische ________” I forget some outfit that did more of
                    their stuff for the communist party they were more connected to the party, they
                    were all party obviously. It was all interconnected but some more so than
                    others. But some of them had amazing views of the United States because they had
                    never been to the United States. They really had no sense of what we were like
                    as a society. I think they really saw the United States through their own very
                    Marxist prism and were expecting at any moment a revolution would break out or
                    whatever. So engaging them and involving them in things like the international
                    visitors program and real exchange I think that was a good thing and a debate
                    that we always had was can this place really exist on its own. Does the GDR have
                    sufficient claim to sovereignty and to the loyalty of the people for whom the
                    GDR exists as a separate and independent state. We used to talk about that in
                    the embassy and that was the basic question and of course that got answered
                    later on. As it happened I was at the American embassy in Bonn serving when the
                    wall came down and very quickly the GDR imploded and even before the wall came
                    down in Berlin I think East Germans were voting with their feet. I think what
                    really precipitated it all were television reports that they are sniping the
                    barbed wire between Hungary and Austria and at that point lots of East Germans
                    began thinking “Hmm, if they are cutting the barbed wire between Hungary and
                    Austria I can drive through Czechoslovakia...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well were talking about '89 or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, that is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stick to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, I'm getting ahead of myself. But that was the question we were
                    asking. Would these people if they were a separate and independent German
                    Republic be content to be citizens of the separate and independent German
                    Democratic Republic or was this a state that exists only because of 500,000
                    Soviet troops and the Brezhnev Doctrine and a wall around it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get the feeling of that everybody was
                        reporting to everybody to the Stasis and all that? I mean was this sort of
                        the atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, that was pervasive and everybody thought that everybody else was
                    informing on them and they were right. We got to know some people from the
                    Evangelical Church, the Lutheran Church and you know going out to their house
                    was always something and we were observed always and you never knew who these
                    people were either. Were they Stasi plants or were they who they said they were?
                    And yeah you always had the feeling that everything that I'm doing and everybody
                    who I'm talking to is subject to reporting to the Stasi. Everything that I say
                    in my apartment and everything that I say on the telephone is possibly being
                    monitored or being listened to. But, you know, you get over that and think, what
                    the hell, I'm here to do press and cultural work and I'm here to engage the GDR
                    and that is what we will do. We were very busy and we did a lot of good
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can see on the cultural side you can be busy but what
                        about the press side? I mean talk about a controlled press.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Oh yeah, that was pretty hopeless. There it was a matter of engaging
                    people of the press was a big, big deal as far as the East Germans were
                    concerned. I mean Marxist theology and the press was agitprop. That is where you
                    would address the masses, that is where you win over the masses to the
                    appropriate class consciousness. So the people in the press were convinced
                    communists and convinced ideologues but nevertheless we were engaging them and
                    trying to work with them and we got involved with some of them in international
                    visitors programs. I mean they were communists and we weren't going to change
                    their point of view but they learned something from these trips. I think it
                    changed their opinions somewhat. They did some good reporting as to what the
                    Americans were really like. But trying to place anything in the press or the
                    press giving any sort of favorable coverage to anything having to do with the
                    United States was nonsense. Everybody knew before it happened before we got your
                    “Neues Deutschland” (New Germany) you knew what the editorial news treatment of
                    any given story is going to be, that was never in question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I take it that there was a little different attitude
                        that you were observing there. I've talked to people who were in Poland
                        around this time and they used to say that they were convinced that there
                        must have been four or five dedicated communists in the country but they
                        weren't quite sure which ones they were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I think there were more dedicated communists in East Germany. They had a
                    different history than Poland I think and a really lot of dedicated folks in
                    East Germany had been communists even in the 1920s. So they came from communist
                    backgrounds that went back to the 1920s, 1930s. Some of them had gone into exile
                    in the Soviet Union. There was a wonderful film I would love to take a look at
                    it again, “Ich War Neunsein” (I Was Nineteen), it was done by Konrad Wolff who
                    was the head of the GDR Academy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The title means I Was Nineteen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I Was Nineteen, yeah, and he was the head of the East German Academy of
                    Art. He was a major figure in the art world and a very talented filmmaker. His
                    brother Mischa Wolff as he was called was the head of intelligence. He was Le
                    Carre's guy; he was the best of the best. They were from a communist family that
                    had gone into exile in the Soviet Union fleeing ahead of Hitler. The film, “Ich
                    War Neunsein,” was an officer in the Red Army at the age of nineteen as a first
                    lieutenant in the Soviet army that marched into Eastern Germany and was guilty
                    of course of all kinds of atrocities and stuff like that. The film is really
                    almost an apologia of this is the way it was and this is what we did and this is
                    why we did it. It has some gruesome scenes of people shooting in the haystacks
                    where Germans were hiding from the Soviet army and stuff like that. But I Was
                    Nineteen and the Hitler regime that we attacked had suffered tremendously from
                    in the Soviet Union was you know, there it was. It was just a great, great film
                    but these are the kinds of people that I think some of the communists in East
                    Germany drew their inspirations from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, jumping way ahead but today there seems to be a
                        problem with the East Germans who also brought up that they had no
                        connection to the Hitler regime at all, that everything nasty was done
                        essentially by the West Germans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That was very much the case. We used to laugh about that that you know it
                    was as if the East Germans got out from under the guilt business completely. You
                    had the impression that in all of the Third Reich these were Bavarians who came
                    over and South Germans or whatever and took over the country and did all these
                    terrible, horrible things. Then thanks to the Red Army they were finally kicked
                    out with great bloodshed and mayhem obviously and they all went to West Germany
                    and established the Federal Republic of Germany and now we communists were
                    morally pure and we're establishing this guilt-free regime on East German
                    soil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the attitude that you were picking up towards
                        the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>RUEDY: It was very much mixed. I remember one conversation I had with the guy
                    from this GDR academy, this diplomatic think tank. There was a question of well
                    doesn't the presence of half a million Soviet troops on your territory impinge
                    on your own state sovereignty? He came up with the very logical thing of if
                    there weren't these five hundred thousand Red Army troops on our country we
                    wouldn't need a sovereignty at all. He was right. I think people even East
                    Germans saw it as a necessary evil even people who were committed to the GDR
                    regime and there were some who thought that our state wouldn't exist without the
                    presence of these. They didn't have much contact with the GDR population. I mean
                    you went out, and we traveled around East Germany a lot and saw the Soviet
                    troops all over the place. You saw the tanks and we stayed in one place up north
                    of Berlin and heard the tanks rumbling not far away at night doing their
                    exercises. MiGs would fly low over the lakes and the military presence was
                    everyplace. But, there wasn't much contact I think and people would chuckle
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well were you picking up, I mean later you were in the
                        Soviet Union but were you picking up the feeling that gee East Germany is a
                        dynamic industrial might? This became sort of a leitmotif that went around
                        and when the place collapsed they realized my God they really got stuck with
                        a mess, an economic mess. I mean was it part of your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I don't know, now in retrospect. I mean it was interesting things that we
                    thought they were going on with what was it, coal gasification, because East
                    Germany was desperate for energy. Gas to run the tanks was a big problem for the
                    old Third Reich folks so they kind of inherited the technology of Ververmacht
                    and were trying to do coal gasification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would see the cars during World War II with these
                        monstrosities looking like boilers stuck on top of cars.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, so there was interest that maybe there was technology going on in
                    coal gasification and liquefaction and various other things. People were still
                    waiting eight years to get a lousy car. There was a lot of propaganda about the
                    wonderful strides they were making and how things were getting better and better
                    and better but when you looked around people were not living very well and it
                    was just not a very dynamic place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing, particularly of the intellectual elite,
                        music and cultural things sort of a steady leakage to the west?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Very much so, very much so. This is all ancient history now but fifteen,
                    twenty years ago this was a big deal that everybody in East Germany could watch
                    West German TV and getting over to West Germany was like going to the moon. But
                    you can get “abends kommt der klassen find” (at night comes the class enemy) so
                    everybody would be watching the same programs on West German television. They
                    wouldn't talk about it the next day in the office or school because that was a
                    bad thing if you had watched West German TV. But people were very aware of the
                    West and very aware of western culture, western consumerism. People detracted
                    from that a little bit — I mean here we were building this idealistic communist
                    society and over there they had all gone consumer crazy. But there was a great
                    deal of envy and a great feeling that well geeze if it weren't for being stuck
                    in this GDR we could be doing that too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were sponsoring some trips to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did these work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Very well, we didn't have a large program; we had a couple of programs. We
                    had IREX, which was an exchange of research scholars. The research scholars did
                    no lecturing. It was strictly American researchers going to East Germany to the
                    GDR and GDR researchers coming to the United States. When I was there that was a
                    very small program and as I recall it amounted to 36 man months per year so it
                    didn't amount to a whole lot of people. While I was there we increased it to 64.
                    We doubled it as I recall and they would present their slate of researchers that
                    they wanted to come to the United States and we would present our slate and we
                    would knock off their nuclear scientists and their physicists. They were
                    interested in access to American science and we were interested in sending over
                    constitutional scholars and contemporary historians. They didn't want those so
                    it was always sort of a give and take as to who would be acceptable to the
                    program.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We got a great deal out of that program because we sent over lots of scholars who
                    were going into archives that Americans had not had access to since 1930 and
                    some of them were doing great work on Bach and Martin Luther because that is
                    where the archives were. Some of the others were into much more sensitive areas
                    talking about more contemporary issues. GDR party archives stuff like that. That
                    was a no-no. You couldn't get into that and great resourcefulness and purpose
                    were needed. A few of the scholars did it but it was tough. We had some really
                    good American scholars and I was there for three years. After they would get
                    back to the States we would remain in contact and they would send us copies of
                    their books and their monographs. And by God by the end of three years in East
                    Berlin I had a pretty good size shop that they had sent me and I looked at the
                    shelf and I thought “my God these are all books that would not have been written
                    and scholarship that would not have been done but for the existence of this IREX
                    program.”</p>
                <p>So that was one thing that was on the academic side. No student exchange. The
                    IREXers generally did not lecture before GDR student groups; some of the more
                    resourceful ones developed fairly wide contacts in the GDR and the community. In
                    fact, one guy got married to an East German economist and that was an
                    interesting story. She had a hell of a time in getting her exit visa; but a
                    great couple. I kept in contact with them for years and years afterward.</p>
                <p>On the official exchange side we would invite a number of GDR folks to come to
                    the United States under the International Visitors Program. I forget how many we
                    would invite in the course of a year but we would invite writers, film makers,
                    some government academics to come to the United States for generally a month and
                    in some cases a longer period of time but generally a month. They would travel
                    around the country and get a sense of who we were as a society. One guy I
                    remember, he was sort of an ideology type, a friendly enough guy but a real
                    convinced communist. He was from one of the research institutes and he came to
                    the United States and then over the week, he spoke pretty good English. He was
                    one of those people who were coming in to study the United States and he was
                    amazed with the openness actually. He could travel around on his own, he didn't
                    need an escort or interpreter so people in Washington would set up appointments
                    for him. Then he got a rental car one weekend and he locked his key in his
                    rental car and what do I do now? Somebody said you have to call the police. Oh
                    my God if I call the police and they find out that I'm an East German, what's
                    going to happen to me? He said the policeman came over and said, “Oh locked the
                    key in the car, well not a big deal.” So the policeman got this tool out and
                    reached in and pulled the key out. He never even checked my driver's license. If
                    I had known that I would have asked for a better car. But he was just really
                    impressed by the openness and the complete informality and the complete lack of
                    this control police state. He was up in Maine and locked his key in his car and
                    a friendly policeman comes and unlocks the car for him and sends him on his way.
                    That just made a tremendous impression.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Another guy a good, good filmmaker, he made a great film. He had that film in the
                    can before we sent him to Iowa City, to send him to the Iowa Writers Program for
                    two months. The film, Solo Sunny, was about a young East German woman who felt
                    really tied down and closed in and claustrophobic in this very small society and
                    she really identified with modernism and rock bands and stuff like that. She
                    wasn't all that bright, she was kind of a working class type but her great
                    ambition was to do a solo and in Marxist terms solos aren't good but the solo
                    became sort of a metaphor to break away from the whole destructive part of the
                    Marxist state. Anyway a very bright guy. I don't know whatever happened to him
                    but he was very much moved by the experiences he had. He said he grew
                    professionally a lot by that experience and obviously for a couple of months. So
                    we were doing that type of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of cultural exhibits struck the most, you might
                        say, responsive cord?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: A lot of interest in American film and we did an American film week in
                    three East German cities, not in Berlin. We ran into great issues which we
                    didn't realize we would get into, copyright and copyright holders of the film
                    very often were West German companies and very good dubbed versions of the film
                    would exist but we couldn't get at them because they were interested in showing
                    them on West German television or whatever. That got terribly, terribly
                    complicated but we carried it off finally and we had some good American films,
                    the classic American. They were interested in more contemporary stuff but we
                    couldn't get those so these were classic American films. It was a western as I
                    can recall and I think maybe a Mr. Smith Goes to Washington type film and Capra
                    type of film, I forget. So anyway there was a great deal of interest in whatever
                    film.</p>
                <p>Literature, American literature was also a great interest to people and there
                    again they just had no access to American literature in books and in, you would
                    see it on television but books, a copy of an American book they all existed in
                    German translation but they were not available in the GDR, just not available,
                    they just were not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because actually a lot of books just have no

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No it was strictly ideological, this was literature from the West and they
                    didn't do it. Sometimes interesting I still got it I think from a professor that
                    I knew did a very interesting translation, a good translation, of poems of the
                    professional poet...</p>

                <p>RUEDY: Yes, exactly Robert Lowell. He did a really good German translation of
                    Robert Lowell's poetry. He did a great introduction, which saw Robert Lowell not
                    as this great confessional poet looking into his soul in his own madness and
                    stuff like that but really interacting with capitalist consumer society. Of
                    course, you can read that in Lowell. There is a lot of that in Lowell and it was
                    a very good what is it for the union dead where the rock of ages becomes a Moser
                    safe and survives the blast and all that stuff. Well anyway he was looking at
                    Robert Lowell from a more Marxist standpoint but it was a legitimate
                    interesting, I think intellectual, honest way of looking at it and here it was a
                    Robert Lowell collection but you didn't see much of that. A lot of that stuff
                    was available in the BAD in excellent German translations but did not make their
                    way to East Germany because all of that stuff was confiscated at the border, it
                    could not get in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American music? The kids wearing jeans added
                        much to the dismay of whom, the critics East and West?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: They loved it, they loved American music, American jazz. We had a couple
                    of American music groups over there. My boss who was a good, good guy a very
                    senior Foreign Service officer, Ed Alexander, a man in his late-eighties now and
                    I still keep in contact with him and he lives here in Bethesda. He is a
                    specialist in music, he is a musicologist and was a music guy for RIAS, Radio in
                    the American Sector, early in his career. So he did most of the music and stuff
                    and me not being musical I didn't get into that much. I did more on the
                    literature side and stuff like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1980, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I went from Berlin in 1980, East Berlin you know we advertised as a
                    hardship post and it really was a hardship post, it was tough in many ways. From
                    there I went to the best assignment that I had in my Foreign Service career
                    because they sent me to Dusseldorf as branch public affairs officer and that was
                    my onward assignment after leaving East Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. Today is the 28th of April of 2005. You were in
                        Dusseldorf in 1980 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: From 1980 to 1984, for four years and it was a terrific assignment and an
                    interesting four years in the Federal Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests there and could you mention who
                        the consul general was then in Dusseldorf and what you were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, the consul general when I first got there was Tom Turqman, I
                    believe, and then later on David Edminster. Terrific people to work with and as
                    branch public affairs officer I had a small staff. I had four Germans who worked
                    for me, excellent people, really good people; a couple of them had master's
                    degrees from American universities and all that kind of thing. My boss was down
                    at the embassy in Bonn comfortably far away and I was responsible for public
                    diplomacy, public affairs activities in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia,
                    which is the most populous area of Germany, the big Rhine-Ruhr complex.
                    Dusseldorf, the capital, but also I spent a good deal of time in places like
                    Essen, in Dortmund and Muenster and Krefeld and throughout that big, big region,
                    so it was an interesting beat to cover at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1980 how stood relations with West Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was an interesting period, the four years that I spent there because I
                    arrived in Dusseldorf not long after, well let's see, the 1980 election. Reagan
                    was elected President. I think there was a great cultural gap between the Reagan
                    appeal to the American public and the concerns that Europeans, certainly
                    Germans, had about Reagan and we were entering a very difficult period. The
                    Soviets had invaded Afghanistan, there was all kinds of stirrings and stuff like
                    that beginning in Poland and Eastern Europe. The big front burner issue was the
                    NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) “Double Beschluss,” the Dual-Track
                    Decision which had been made under the government of Helmut Schmidt and SPD
                    (Social Democratic Party) government. The Germans, in particular the Europeans
                    in general, during an earlier era had been very concerned about the American
                    commitment to western Europe and to NATO. They were especially concerned of the
                    stationing of Soviet SS20 missiles which were capable of hitting western Europe
                    but not capable of hitting the United States. So there was all of this and it
                    sounds terribly arcane now and it was but a good deal of discussion about
                    decoupling security interests of the United States and those of the western
                    European NATO allies. As a result a decision had been made to answer the Soviet
                    stationing of the SS20s with stationing of medium range ballistic missiles by
                    the United States...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Pershing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: ...in Europe. The Pershing, exactly. There were actually two as I recall,
                    there were cruise missiles which were going to be stationed in Italy, I believe,
                    and in Germany and perhaps in another country as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Netherlands I think got into it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, you are right. These were the cruise missiles but the things that
                    were really of concern to people were the Pershing IIs and the P2s were going to
                    go only into Germany so it put Germany square in the center of that whole
                    discussion. The P2s that were talked about were capable of hitting the Soviet
                    Union within five minutes or ten minutes of liftoff from bases in Germany and
                    there was great, great, great opposition suddenly to the stationing of the
                    Pershing missiles in Germany. The peace movement was well underway and it was a
                    rather turbulent period in terms of German-American relations.</p>
                <p>Not long after I got there the SPD was going through a great deal of sorting out.
                    I don't remember exactly when this occurred but it seems to me that it was in
                    the spring or summer perhaps of 1981, the Schmidt government collapsed
                    essentially because the left wing of the SPD was no longer supported and of
                    course this is where it gets a little complicated. The FDP (Free Democratic
                    Party) coalition collapsed. Governments were built during that period of time in
                    post-war Germany, not so much by election victories on the part of the SPD or on
                    the part of the CDU (Christian Democratic Union), it was more a matter of the
                    FDP switching coalition partners and suddenly because of all of the turbulence
                    within the SPD Schmidt stepped down and that whole era, the Schmidt-Brandt era
                    was gone. A CDU government took over, a coalition government under Helmut Kohl.
                    So the whole political complexion in Germany changed quite dramatically and then
                    as I say there was a great deal of turbulence in connection with implementation
                    of the dual-track decision, that's the decision to go ahead to station or not to
                    station P2 missiles in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now this was sort of in many ways the last ploy of
                        the Soviet Union, this idea of putting the SS20s was the idea that this
                        might split Germany essentially or Europe off from the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes it was. That was definitely true and we saw it played out. For me it
                    was a particularly interesting vantage point. I was an entrenched guy, branch
                    public affairs officer in Dusseldorf so I was not a ranking person in the
                    corridors of Bonn. But North Rhine-Westphalia was really the center of SPD power
                    and moderate SPD power. The state accounted for about a third, more than a
                    third, of the Federal Republic's total population and this was the mainstay of
                    the SPD in Germany. This was labor union territory. This was the Ruhr, this was
                    Essen, and Dortmund and the big, big newspapers, moderate newspapers, but left
                    leaning left of center newspapers in the heartland of SPD territory. So it was
                    interesting to get to know local political officials and newspaper editors and
                    others and to get a sense of how they really came down on all of these issues. I
                    was astonished that as a low ranking or you know fairly new officer in the
                    consulate general in Dusseldorf I would have access to big deal newspaper
                    editors. The Westfalishe Allgemeine Zeitung (Westphalia Peoples Newspaper) is
                    the largest circulation by far in Germany and I knew the editor personally and
                    he came to my house. This had nothing to do with me personally. It had to do
                    with their concern about the connection with the United States and the alliance
                    and all that kind of stuff, so it was interesting to see all of that play
                    out.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean you had a couple of things going for you but a
                        couple of balls in play. One was Reagan, obviously the Germans knew him as a
                        cowboys movie star...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is always scary but you know and coming from the
                        pretty far right of the American political spectrum and then on top of that
                        you have the introduction of nuclear weapons which might attract unwanted
                        attention from the Soviets nuclear weapons. How did you play with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: The Reagan business obviously scared the Germans to death. This was
                    somebody outside of their political framework and they had a hard time figuring
                    out Reagan and Reagan's appeal to the American public. I remember one of the
                    very first programs that I did in Dusseldorf after arriving there as BPAO
                    (Branch Public Affairs Officer). It was not long after the election, it must
                    have been in late November and I had Richard Scammon, who was a well known
                    American public opinion pollster, at my house in Dusseldorf. I invited some of
                    the big deal editors and they came. Scam and I remember talking to them about
                    how Reagan fit into the American political culture and how during the election
                    the democrats had tried to pull the bad guy mask, the ogre mask down on Reagan
                    and it just didn't fit because here you had this very amiable character. I think
                    it really helped put the Reagan presidency into a political context for these
                    very sharp and smart and shrewd and quite senior German analysts. I remember a
                    couple of them afterwards told me, “Oh yes, this is good, this was something
                    that was informative for me.” It was that kind of thing of trying to bring the
                    realities of American political culture to the Germans and to some extent
                    vice-versa as well and also to keep the focus on the whole reason for the
                    “double beschluss”, for the dual-track decision. Then I think in an overarching
                    way the importance of solidarity in the alliance and the importance of shared
                    values between the Germans, the western Europeans and the United States and how
                    it was important to keep that connection.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Fairly soon after I had got to Dusseldorf some people from Krefeld called the
                    consul general and asked to get together for lunch because they had this
                    wonderful idea. It was really something that came to dominate the four years
                    that I spent in Dusseldorf and it was a wonderful event. They had the idea of
                    making Krefeld the focal point for a major celebration. This was local
                    boosterism, they were interested in raising the profile of Krefeld and putting
                    Krefeld on the map. To make Krefeld a center of attention for a 300th
                    anniversary of German emigration to the United States. The first Germans had
                    emigrated from Krefeld to William Penn's Pennsylvania in 1683. The first Germans
                    I think set sail from Krefeld going down the Rhine to what is Antwerp or
                    whatever, or Rotterdam and then across the Atlantic at the invitation of William
                    Penn to settle in Pennsylvania — Germantown which is now part of Philadelphia.
                    Those were the first Pennsylvania Dutch, the first Pennsylvania Germans and as
                    we discovered became the very first of the ethnic group of the German emigrants
                    to the United States which were the largest ethnic component to go to the United
                    States and emigration continued obviously lots and lots in the 19th century
                    after 1848 and all of that stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a rather famous consul there too in Krefeld, Bret
                        Harte.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, yes, Bret Harte was the consul in Krefeld when it was part of Prussia
                    because Krefeld after the Napoleonic wars had become part of Prussia and it was
                    a textile center and I wound up spending lots and lots of time in Krefeld.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For some reason I did some work on Bret Harte and I think
                        buttons were a big deal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, he has a couple of good short stories. Krefeld was the center of the
                    textile industry and he's got a couple of short stories, which draw on his
                    experience in Krefeld, which was not all together positive. He didn't like
                    Prussian recommendations all that much. Edinburgh, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Edinburgh or Glasgow, one or the other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>RUEDY: He was a good deal happier in Scotland but the period in Krefeld was
                    interesting and some of the buildings that were described in his short stories
                    are recognizable buildings in Krefeld. Anyway, I got to spend lots of time in
                    Krefeld over the next number of years. There was lots and lots of stuff that
                    took place in connection with the tri-centennial of German emigration to the
                    United States. The climax came at a big deal “festock” they called it in German
                    in Krefeld in I believe it was in June of 1983. It all got to be a big deal.
                    Helmut Kohl was there and then Vice President George Bush was there to represent
                    the United States. There was much speech making and also lots and lots of
                    demonstrators and demonstrations and things got quite bouncy and violence. The
                    motorcade was stoned and it was a big headline in the Washington Post. This all
                    occurred on a Sunday in Germany and, of course, it was in time to make the
                    Sunday newspapers in the United States so it became quite a bouncy, bouncy
                    event.</p>
                <p>The entire tri-centennial thing I think got to be a big deal because of the state
                    of German-American relations at the time and American concern about the peace
                    movement and about how things were developing in Germany and about opposition to
                    the dual-track decision. It was that whole constellation of things that got
                    Helmut Kohl to Krefeld and that got George Bush to Krefeld and made this whole
                    thing into such a big, big deal. That thing, I believe it was June of 1983, was
                    the culminating event but during the lead up there was lots and lots of
                    activity. I was involved very much in that. I gave a couple of speeches before
                    the city chambers of commerce and the trade groups and we really worked hard to
                    bring this to the attention of the people in Bonn to get it on to the embassy
                    scope as an event that ought to be supported and it kind of brewed right along.
                    It got to be a major event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did various elements in the United States respond to
                        this? I'm thinking of towns and states and the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: The State Department had a great deal of interest. There was some interest
                    on the part of folks in Philadelphia, and so we tried very much to engage the
                    United States side as well. Of course, here in the U.S. it's a much bigger
                    country with lots of stuff going on. I think in Germany there was not
                    disappointment, I think that is putting it too strongly but you know a feeling
                    that this is a big deal here in Germany why isn't it a big deal in the United
                    States. But, there was a fair amount of publicity in the United States in
                    connection with the tri-centennial. The State Department and the German embassy
                    certainly made an effort to make this into a big deal. Not far from the
                    Washington Monument now right along Constitution Avenue (between 15th and 17th
                    Streets) is a lovely little green area and if you look carefully you will see
                    little signs that say the German-American Friendship Garden 1683-1983
                    celebrating 300 years of German emigration to the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>So there were some articles, there were some TV programs, it didn't get lost but
                    it wasn't nearly as big a deal in the United States as it was in Germany. I
                    think in Germany people were very much aware that this was going on, that we had
                    300 years of German emigration to the United States. The German emigrants
                    constituted the largest, single ethnic group of European migrants, from any
                    country to the U.S. and German contributions to America and blah, blah, blah, it
                    went on and on.</p>
                <p>I did a couple of articles for papers, and for magazines and gave a couple of
                    speeches, which I think were pretty good actually. I did quite a bit of research
                    because it was a topic that interested me so I'm obviously a part of that. There
                    was a personal connection as well, very much a personal connection since my own
                    ethnic background is German-American. But the first German families that
                    departed from Krefeld were actually kicked out, of course, and they weren't
                    Krefelders. Krefeld is very Catholic, it's the Catholic Rhineland so Krefeld is
                    very Catholic but these families were actually from further up stream from the
                    Rhine and they were actually German Anabaptists, Mennonites. They had a tough
                    time of it. There was obviously a religious affinity, a theological affinity
                    with these people and with the Quakers and William Penn who's really all part of
                    the same religious movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of [inaudible]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly, that's exactly right. So these people were kicked out of the area
                    where they were in in the south, wound up in Krefeld and from Krefeld moved on
                    then down the Rhine to the ports and at William Penn's invitation over to
                    Pennsylvania. They became the first Pennsylvania Dutch, and Amish and Mennonites
                    and what have you. Of course, ultimately the group that I grew up in in the
                    Amana colonies in Iowa were part of the same general religious movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the stoning of the Vice President but was
                        this effort in '83 to cement ties and all, was that seen as a target by left
                        wing wings and others or was it happening on its own?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I think it was seen as a target to some extent. I mean there were lots of
                    demonstrations going on, the peace movement. I remember outside of our house in
                    Dusseldorf was a sort of a traffic circle and that led on into the Dusseldorf
                    fair grounds. Not because my house was there, but because of the traffic circle
                    and the traffic flow I remember we had big, big groups of demonstrators who
                    gathered at that traffic circle and then marched on down to downtown Dusseldorf.
                    There was not a problem in Dusseldorf but in some areas some of these
                    demonstrations became quite violent and there was lots of concern about the
                    peace movement and the peace movement getting out of hand. There were certainly
                    folks who were encouraging that. I think more radical elements and I think a lot
                    of Germans were deeply, deeply concerned. They felt the Pershing IIs go in and
                    we have war. There was a great deal of fear about what would happen as a result
                    of the Pershing IIs. Then, of course, when you had statements from the United
                    States like 'there are more important things than peace' or whatever and some of
                    these statements were made offhand and in the context of the speech or in the
                    context of the American political debate or in the context of what Reagan was
                    trying to do, they perhaps made sense. But, when they were reported in “Der
                    Spiegel” (The Mirror newspaper) or “Stern” or some of the more sensationalist
                    German newspapers they just drove people nuts. People thought the Americans are
                    going to cause this war and we here in Germany are going to be the ones who are
                    going to get blown up. There were people that really felt that way. They were
                    convinced that the P2s go in and the balloon goes up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were dealing with I imagine by the time you got there
                        in the early '80s there must have had some difficult cadre with German
                        leaders and with just plain Germans who had been to the United States and
                        all. Was that a good thing or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was a very, very good thing. I have heard analysis of the public
                    diplomacy and how important it was to the implementation of the Dual Track
                    decision, the “Double Beschluss.” There was a great deal of discussion of the
                    merits of countering the Soviet stationing of the SS20s with the Pershing IIs
                    and how eventually people became convinced of this because the arguments were so
                    overwhelming and so convincing and I think basically that wasn't it at all. I
                    think what brought the German public around, and I think there remained lots of
                    skepticism on the side of the German public at large not just the radicals but
                    also the broad center of the German public, was a gradual conviction that the
                    relationship with the United States and the solidarity of the NATO alliance was
                    something terribly, terribly, important. hat needed to be maintained and
                    although they didn't necessarily like or agree with the stationing of Pershing
                    20s this now was on track and somehow it had to move forward and be carried out.
                    They couldn't very well draw back from that or change that because the risk of
                    that would have been greater than the risk of implementation. I think there we
                    really drew upon the fact that there were so many Germans with first hand
                    experience in the United States who knew us as a society who felt a solidarity
                    with us, who felt deep in their bones I think a conviction that the
                    German-American relationship was fundamentally important to the security of
                    Germany that they weren't going to let something like the “Double Beschluss” get
                    in the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I experienced that in talking to some of these chief editors. These were sort of
                    New York Times type guys. They had newspapers with, forget the circulation, but
                    hundreds of thousands and they were the newspapers that SPD politicians in
                    Germany in Bonn would turn to in the morning because that is where their
                    constituency was. The “Neue Rhine Zeitung” (The New Rhine Newspaper) and the
                    “Westfalishe Allgemeine Zeitung” (The Westfalishe Newspaper) and some of these
                    other big Rhine-Ruhr papers. Talking to them they would tell you, “Man that year
                    at Stanford as a young man and it changed my life. The relationship with the
                    United States. I know America as a country and all that stuff.” So I think
                    during this period we were very much benefiting from lots and lots of work that
                    had gone on for a generation.</p>
                <p>I think in that sense the whole notion of the 1983 celebration of German
                    emigration to the United States was right on as well. I think it put the
                    emphasis on the long term, the relationship, the cultural relationship,
                    everything else between Germany and the United States. So as I say it got away
                    from the issues of the moment no matter how important they were to the
                    overarching issues that were permanent in the relationship and I think from that
                    standpoint it was a good, good thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have, did you play any role or is this how it came
                        about during exchanges with the American universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, I played some role in that. The PAO (Public Affairs Officer) who was
                    in Germany at the time was a guy who I admire tremendously; he was really great
                    Tom Tuch. This was all kind of a piece. I mean it fit right in to the
                    tri-centennial and Tom was my big, big boss in Germany so first of all to
                    convince him and the other people in the embassy that this event in Krefeld was
                    something that deserved people's attention. He really picked up on this and you
                    know the whole successor generation became a buzzword for us and he inaugurated
                    I think you know he really worked on the then ambassador to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Arthur Burns and Burns was a huge figure. I didn't know him personally but
                    what a personality, what an individual. They made a big effort to increase youth
                    exchange. The congress bundestag youth exchange was inaugurated, was launched
                    bringing an exchange in high school students. There was much emphasis on
                    increased numbers of international visitors and especially involved in young
                    people, academics and young journalists and things like the IV (international
                    visitors) program. We were working on that very, very hard. At the macro level
                    at the embassy in Bonn people like Tom Tuch were really behind it and pushing
                    it. It all kind of tied in with the whole tri-centennial effort, etc., etc. so
                    it was an interesting time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to reach places like New Braunfels? There
                        are a lot of German communities all over the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: You know we had a guy from New Braunfels, a professor who came over a
                    number of times and got him to give lectures and interviews. There were all
                    kinds of strange tie-ins because he found a German musical production in sort of
                    the tradition of the German cabaret at the time that had been staged in Texas by
                    German emigrants. So, there were lots and lots of connections and then Chicago
                    and little towns across the Midwest and so on, it got to be a big deal, it was
                    gratifying. It would have been my last New Years in Krefeld, in Germany. In
                    every German city they do a Neue Yaaren Fund (a New Years reception). This is a
                    very solemn and important occasion where all of the city fathers gather together
                    and the mayor gives a nice speech and they give awards and stuff like that. In
                    New Year's 1984 I got the Stadtziegal of the city of Krefeld, the city seal, and
                    a nice speech. Of course it was not for me, it really wasn't for me personally.
                    This is not false modesty; it's the truth. It was this idea that they had felt
                    the support of the United States and the support of the embassy and the support
                    of everybody, the support of the consulate early on in carrying through this
                    event which turned out to be I think a tremendous success. It was a nice event
                    and then it turned out to be potentially so difficult. I think it woke up people
                    to the concern that maybe this whole business is getting out of hand. Maybe we
                    really ought to step back from the whole hysteria of the moment and look at the
                    eternal, look at the basics. We don't need headlines in the American press about
                    how the American vice president is being stoned in the German city. We don't
                    need stuff about the violence of the peace movements. There seemed to be maybe a
                    stepping back from the brink that occurred sometime that spring. Maybe some of
                    the publicity around the Krefeld event that was only part of it but it had
                    something to do with that. I had the impression that gradually the air was being
                    let out of the balloon and people were coming back down to earth and here we are
                    and what do we do and maybe we could have done it differently and decided
                    differently two years ago but here we are in July of 1983 and what do we do
                    next. Of course the dual track decision was carried out and you had the proposal
                    for the zero solution and eventually negotiations between the United States and
                    the Soviet Union and all kinds of stuff, so it worked out. But, it was a bouncy
                    period. I think, 1981, 1982 it was a bouncy period for German-American
                    relations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Green Movement going or how did it translate into
                        your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, very much so. The Greens were the left wing fringe and I think the
                    SPD was terribly concerned about the Greens, and it was true, the Greens taking
                    votes away from the SPD and Petra Kelly was around. Petra Kelly came to the
                    event in Krefeld, as did all of the other German political dignitaries of both
                    parties. The Greens were behind a lot of the peace movement stuff and the left
                    wing of the SPD sort of coalesced. There was a lot of concern about the Green
                    Party, whether they would become a permanent fixture on the political landscape
                    in Germany, what the raise of the Green Party would do to what had been an
                    arrangement between the CDU, the SPD and the FDP and whether they would surpass
                    the five percent and get into the German Bundestag and become a future coalition
                    partner. Of course, all of that eventually transpired but no, that was all going
                    on at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That had pretty well petered out. There was still some of that going on I
                    think, but I don't recall it having the immediacy that it had in the previous
                    period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about was there a significant communist party in

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, not really. There was a good deal of concern I think about communist
                    influence on the political left in Germany but I never felt that communism
                    at...SPD union types and they were more center SPD and I think were concerned as
                    well about what was happening to the left wing of the SPD. These were the SPD
                    centrists and this was the Schmidt SPD and they were concerned about the left
                    wing of the SPD kind of fracturing off and moving toward the Greens and dropping
                    the SPD by a few percentage points. Some of those people we would talk and they
                    would say, “Yeah. I mean these guys from the south the SPD leaders they can
                    posture because they don't have to win elections they know they never will. They
                    don't have to govern because they know they never will, so they can make all
                    kinds of statements but we here are out to win elections and we need to appeal
                    to the center and we need to appeal to voters and we are not into posturing, we
                    are into governing.” So it was a very different SPD perspective from the ones
                    that you got in other regions of Germany.</p>

                        probably, please correct me if I am wrong, less interest in the GDR; I mean
                        unification or anything else. You know they didn't even have a lot of
                        sympathy with them or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>RUEDY: No, not a hell of a lot of sympathy for the GDR certainly. People were
                    certainly interested in the GDR. They were very interested in my experience in
                    the GDR because here I had lived in East Berlin for three years. So people were
                    very, very interested in talking to me and hearing from me about that because
                    there was practically no contact between the GDR and the West Germans.</p>
                <p>I remember a book that appeared at the time, “Die Andere Planet” (The Other
                    Planet), and this was the GDR because people simply didn't know anything about
                    it. People were very interested, it was the other Germany but it was all very
                    distant and very abstract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you called upon to make speeches about your
                        experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, I did. One of the things that I was supposed to be doing as a BPO was
                    to go around and meet with groups of USOs, the young socialists and the Greens
                    and the young CDU types. Some of these experiences were very interesting and I
                    always was courteously received. People asked tough questions but people were
                    interested as only Germans are and getting into a “gespracht” (spoken), in
                    always wanting to talk, discuss and I was amazed instead of disappearing for the
                    weekends like Americans do the Germans would go to political conclaves. So I
                    would be invited to come up to Muenster to speak at this political conclave on
                    when, Sunday afternoon. This happened a lot and I enjoyed it. It was fun and
                    interesting to get to know people and to sort of get a sense of where they were
                    coming from or what their concerns were.</p>
                <p>But the point that you made earlier about sympathy for communists no, not at all.
                    I didn't get any sense of that. I think the concern was the equidistant that
                    they saw the Soviet Union as an adversary on one side but they saw the United
                    States on the other side and in the super power rivalry German interests getting
                    lost and Germans themselves being put in danger. There was one unforgettable
                    Spiegel cover that I remember seeing; I think I saved it as a matter of fact
                    which showed the very somber looking German citizen with one eye blinded by the
                    hammer and cycle and the other eye blinded by the red, white and blue and
                    putting Germans very much in the middle. Germans were in the cross hairs and the
                    super power rivalry between the Soviet Union and this dangerously radical new
                    Reagan administration being played out over the interests of the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense...at one time in Germany people like myself,
                        I served as an enlisted man in the armed forces in Germany and so many
                        people, I mean Foreign Service, I also served in Frankfurt in Germany. One
                        time we had a third of the Foreign Service in Germany and so many Americans
                        had relatives who were in the armed forces going to Germany so it was very
                        much a focal point. The normal American if he is going to go to Europe,
                        Germany is about fifth or sixth on the list, I mean its the UK, France,
                        Italy and Spain. Was there a sense of the American public wasn't paying that
                        much attention to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I think Europeans in general, maybe Germans in particular, are always
                    concerned that Americans don't know enough about Europe and don't know enough
                    about Germany. That was the question that I ran into a lot and there you would
                    say, “Well, the United States is a big, huge country and we are very focused on
                    events within the United States and no we don't know as much about Europe as we
                    should. We don't know enough about Germany as we ought to but an American in the
                    United States will read a lot less, we'll hear a lot less about Germany than a
                    German in Germany will read about and hear about the United States.” I remember
                    a good anecdote I'm fond of quoting this. A good friend of mine was press
                    attach� at the American embassy in Bonn, a good, good guy. He was in Bonn during
                    the period that I was up in Dusseldorf and he was a solid citizen always
                    somebody good to go to for advice about how things really were. He said, “You
                    know I'm press attach� here at the American embassy in Bonn and I imagine my
                    colleague, my counterpart the Germany press attach� in Washington reading
                    through his New York Times and Washington Post and seeing absolutely nothing
                    about Germany and the ambassador going after him and saying, “Here you are press
                    attach� and we've got nothing from Germany, we've got no news about Germany at
                    all, what's wrong, what aren't you doing your job. Get out there and get busy.”
                    Then he said, “Here I am at the American embassy in Bonn and I read my
                    “Frankfurter Allgemeine” (major Frankfurt newspaper) and I read my “Westfalishe
                    Allgemeine Zeitung” (major Westfalia newspaper) and I don't see anything about
                    the United States on page one and I wipe my brow and I think, 'thank God I've
                    made it through another day.'"</p>
                <p>But that was pretty much the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you get any feel, you had mentioned a term “the
                        successor generation”, did you get any feel that Germany was in a real
                        transition stage. In other words the people from the Hitler time, I mean
                        this is old news pretty much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I think it was very true that things were changing in Germany — the people
                    with the immediate post-war experience and working with the United States, a
                    strong cultural affinity for things American. That was passing from the scene,
                    had past from the scene. A new generation was moving in and the new generation,
                    of course, felt differently about the United States than their predecessors had.
                    That was all part of this whole 'successor generation' initiative getting young
                    Germans reconnected with the U.S. That was 1984 we are talking about. Since that
                    time practically another generation has passed so I can imagine now the
                    situation in Germany is again very, very different. The cold war has ended, the
                    basis for the relationship is much different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But of course in Germany, I mean there was this huge
                        monster hanging around the Germans neck, the albatross or whatever you want
                        to say about World War II...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what it had done. This is a terrible inhibitor and you
                        know just getting rid of that would give them much more freedom to be
                        themselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Absolutely and it was interesting for me. My German is pretty good. You
                    would get to talking with people and would hear just amazing, amazing stories of
                    what people had experienced and what they had endured during World War II in the
                    immediate post-war period and the relationship they had then with the Americans.
                    At first there was a good deal of trepidation and fear and uncertainty but how
                    they had begun working with the Americans and it must have been an amazing,
                    amazing period. A couple people that I had gotten to know had actually
                    experienced their introduction to America as prisoners of war and had come to
                    the U.S. as POWs (prisoner of war) and experienced the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Mississippi and Arkansas...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly, exactly. Maybe I related this story the last time. I forget, but
                    it's a great story. A guy that I got to know was a good economist. He said that
                    he was captured in North Africa and had thought that the war would be over soon
                    and he would be going back as a hero to the fatherland. He got to the United
                    States, to New York and traveled across this vast country where no bomb had ever
                    fallen and he knew that none would and he said it was just an amazing
                    experience. He recounted the kindness that he found from the United States, the
                    informality and I think he went back to Germany after the war committed to
                    working with Americans on the basis of that experience, rather amazing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we were going there I would think that in your
                        particular area in a way you were somewhat blessed by not having an awful
                        lot of American troops there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That's true and I was very much aware of that. I think my experience in
                    Germany as a branch public affairs officer was very different from my colleagues
                    in places like Munich or Stuttgart and Frankfurt because there were very, very
                    few Americans in North Rhine-Westphalia. It was the British occupation zone
                    initially. There was a British garrison in Dusseldorf not far from where we
                    lived as a matter of fact and units of the British army of the Rhine that were
                    stationed further west in Patterborn and air force bases on the other side of
                    the Rhine but very little overt American presence. Businessmen a number of them
                    and folks like that but no American troop presence.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy, did you get, is this a new ambassador and
                        all down there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Occasionally, yes, we occasionally did and my boss the public affairs
                    officer would come up once in a while and we would try to bring in heavy duty
                    speakers like the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) ambassador at the
                    time was W. Tapley Bennett who was extraordinarily good in speaking and meeting
                    with groups. So, to bring in somebody like Tapley Bennett, American ambassador
                    to NATO and get him together with a group of six or eight chief editors or
                    foreign policy guys from the universities and maybe some political types from
                    the North Rhine-Westphalia governments, SPD types from the North
                    Rhine-Westphalia government was always very, very useful. So we did get a fair
                    amount of that stuff but nothing really super VIP (very important person) or
                    anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you left there in '84...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, that is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I came back on a first Washington assignment to be German desk officer at
                    USIA, responsible on the Washington end for support for the programs in East and
                    West Germany. So it was a logical onward assignment and I enjoyed it. I did that
                    for two years and it was a very, very busy period. We had a super dynamic
                    Director of USIA, Charles Wick. Wick was very interested in Germany; Wick had
                    come to Krefeld and had also been very supportive of the whole tri-centennial
                    activity so Germany was very, very much his scope. I was kept busy cranking out
                    all kinds of stuff because he was a very dynamic and fairly demanding
                    individual. He knew about Germany and he visited Germany a number of times while
                    I was desk officer so I would be cranking out memos and decision papers and
                    briefing papers and my God I worked hard and something that was on his scope at
                    the time was RIAS, Radio In the American Sector. He and the German intendant of
                    RIAS had come up with the idea of launching RIAS television so RIAS television
                    was very much under Director Wick's scope. That meant that it was on my scope
                    and it was on the scope of lots and lots of people and there were lots and lots
                    of people between my level and his level. So, I did lots and lots of decision
                    memos and briefing papers and background notes and all kinds of stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RIAS was in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, RIAS is in Berlin and the RIAS was established as an occupation
                    radio. In fact, I think RIAS went on the air with little power to tell Germans
                    where to line up for food and coal and everything else and it was on the air
                    obviously during the Berlin airlift and later then during the period of the
                    Berlin wall. By the time that I was involved in German affairs RIAS had pretty
                    much evolved to become a German station. It was still under official American
                    sovereignty because, of course, the United States was officially sovereign in
                    the American sector of the city of Berlin, but RIAS had a German intendant. It
                    also had an American who was serving at RIAS but the relationship between the
                    German and the American was always very good. The day-to-day operation and
                    day-to-day policy, everything else was handled on the German side. There was a
                    good deal of back and forth about what the American political role would be in
                    RIAS television, what the American financial contribution would be to RIAS
                    television, all kinds of stuff. It got embroiled to some extent in German
                    internal political concerns because I think there were people in Germany who
                    perhaps saw RIAS and RIAS television as a counterweight to what some Berliners,
                    some Germans felt was the left of.</p>
                <p>So as I say there were all kinds of political agendas and political motives at
                    work here and it was a very, very interesting couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: RIAS television got established and it broadcast for a while and then of
                    course everything changed in and around Berlin. I inherited RIAS television
                    concerns later on because my onward assignment after two years on the German
                    desk and a year at the National War College and then an interim stint as acting
                    director of the operations center at USIA was an onward assignment as deputy
                    public affairs officer in Bonn. I guess as a BPAO in Dusseldorf, as a field
                    officer I complained sufficiently about the way things were handled in Bonn that
                    for my sins I was told, “Well, OK, you are going to be the deputy public affairs
                    counselor in Bonn and you are the person sort of in charge of field
                    operations.”</p>
                <p>Anyway I got to Bonn then following the two years on the German desk at USIA
                    during the Wick period and a year at the National War College and then an
                    interim period as operations center director. I got to Bonn in February
                    1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to go back just a touch how did you find the War
                        College?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>RUEDY: The War College was tremendous. It was a wonderful experience and I found
                    the faculty very stimulating and working with other students was tremendous,
                    getting to know other State Department types and USIA types. There were two of
                    us there from USIA and about a dozen or more from the State Department and other
                    foreign affairs agencies. The bulk of the class obviously military officers,
                    really sharp guys who had just made colonel or were on the verge of making
                    colonel and had aspirations for making general I suppose and this was part of
                    the career progression. I found it a tremendously interesting and stimulating
                    year. I did a paper on the implementation of the dual-track decision and public
                    affairs strategy in connection with that and it was a good year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find looking at your assignments, East Germany,
                        Dusseldorf and German desk and then back to Bonn, one could say you belonged
                        to the German Club.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I guess I did, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find...was this a problem in USIA, I mean were
                        people looking and sort of saying it was time you go off to Botswana or
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Maybe so, I don't know if they said that or thought that but they didn't
                    say it to me and I didn't lobby for the assignment to Bonn. As a matter of fact
                    I remember thinking at the time this is probably not good. I had put in for a
                    PAO position elsewhere in Europe. I thought that if I wanted to make senior
                    Foreign Service I've really got to do a PAO job. I thought I was in line for a
                    PAO job in Europe which would have been a good job. It was at the one level, not
                    that these things are things that ought to be paid much attention to. I had also
                    put in for the deputy public affairs officer job in Bonn as sort of a throw
                    away. That was a senior foreign service job and I figured it would probably go
                    to somebody who was a real member of the German club and had been around for a
                    while. Here I was at the War college working away and not really paying too much
                    attention to what was going on in headquarters. I called my career counselor to
                    find out how things were going, how things were looking for this PAO job that I
                    had applied for and thought I had a pretty good shot at and a couple of other
                    PAO jobs that would have been great as well at sort of medium sized posts. I
                    thought that maybe I could aspire to that and he said, “Oh didn't your realize
                    you are being paneled this week for the DPAO (Deputy Public Affairs Officer) job
                    in Bonn.” I thought well wow you know DPAO job in Bonn and it's above my grade.
                    I thought not getting a PAO and being stuck in Germany again and a job at a big
                    embassy, what is this really going to do to me in terms of my “career.” Do I
                    need to worry here, but by that time it was too late. I was up to be paneled and
                    I had put in for the job so, so be it.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>RUEDY: To 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a very interesting time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was, it was. It turned out to be completely fortuitous because had Bonn
                    been the nice quiet embassy in Bonn that I guess it had a reputation for being,
                    being a DPAO there probably would not have been that great in terms of interest
                    or stimulation and also in terms of career pattern. People would have looked at
                    that and said, “Oh a DPO, he's never been a PAO.” But, it turned out to be the
                    period that the wall fell and lots of stuff was going on and it was a very
                    interesting and rewarding time and again I was fortunate to have a couple of
                    really great bosses to work for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was ambassador and PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: The ambassador when I got there was Richard Burt and he and the PAO
                    frankly didn't get along all that well. The PAO was Terry Catherman and Richard
                    Burt was very bright and young and engaged and involved and all over the place.
                    Terry Catherman was also very bright and dynamic and interesting and a good,
                    good guy, a very senior officer who had been in the Foreign Service for
                    something like 30 years and the personal chemistry just wasn't there very much.
                    But, Terry Catherman was a great guy to work for and he was mercurial some times
                    and dynamic, very, very, very smart and a good, good guy to work for. Terry had
                    come to Germany initially I think right after the war and he was the BPAO in
                    Heidelberg or in Frankfurt and he was kind of a charter member of the German
                    club. He had been there from the very beginning, spoke absolutely fluent German
                    and was just a very smart and cagey guy and he would work some of these issues
                    on RIAS and stuff like that. I would go into meetings with him and I would
                    think, my God, how are we ever going to come out right on this one here. We
                    would talk and chat and work it through and Terry would negotiate with the
                    Germans and have a great rapport and he just really clicked.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Richard Burt left then and was replaced by Vernon Walters. Richard Burt
                    was quite a young man and had that reputation in Germany as being a bright,
                    dynamic young man and was replaced by Vernon Walters who had been everyplace and
                    done everything. He had come to Germany, I don't know maybe even been in Germany
                    before World War II, I don't know but had traveled with Averell Harriman to the
                    Ruhr. He had seen the little flowers in the vase in the German ruins and figured
                    if these people are putting up flowers, this country has prospects even though
                    everything is awful. Anyway he was a very, very experienced and wonderful
                    gentleman, really a perfect person to have in Germany at the time and he and
                    Terry got along beautifully. I think the two of them got along very well, which
                    made for a good dynamic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you arrived there what was on your plate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: RIAS, RIAS television and I thought my God, I finally left all these damn
                    memos and briefing papers and Director Wick's rages and dynamism behind, gone on
                    to the War College and here I am the first thing on my plate getting back to
                    Bonn was RIAS again. We were then in the process of getting from here to there,
                    getting RIAS on the air. There was some big problem practically my first day on
                    the job, or my first week on the job and Terry Catherman asked me to look into
                    it. I looked into it and I came up with some half-baked analysis for Terry and
                    Terry looked at that and said, “No, this won't do.” He really called me on it
                    and I thought I'd really screwed up and I had, I forget what the issue was but I
                    hadn't handled it very well and Terry was perfectly right to call me on the
                    carpet for it. But things got sorted out and I worked I think very well with
                    Terry. The two of us were never...we were friends and I had tremendous respect
                    for him and I think he liked my work also but I don't know that we were kindred
                    spirit types but I found it very rewarding to work with Terry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the point of RIAS television?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: To reach a wider audience in East Germany and in Berlin as well and there
                    again there were all kinds of intersecting political agendas. I think for some
                    of the Germans that were involved in RIAS television they were interested in
                    reaching West Berliners who voted. I think on the American side we were
                    interested in reaching East Germans who were getting the message from Sender
                    Fries Berlin and other West German television channels but a feeling that we
                    ought to be able to reach them with an American voice and an American
                    perspective as well. So I think we on the American side saw the primary target
                    audience for RIAS television as the East German public around East Berlin and
                    around the city of Berlin. I think some of the Germans were involved in it, its
                    all that audience too but also saw an audience of Germans who voted and some
                    interest also in broadcasting RIAS television to areas in the Federal Republic
                    and you know how that played out, there were all kinds of concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would we broadcast? I mean what was the plan to
                        broadcast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: News and features, documentaries. There was a lot of discussion about what
                    will RIAS carry that isn't being carried now and Sender Fries Berlin and who
                    actually is the audience for RIAS. Those were all interesting questions and
                    important questions but by that time I think that RIAS had a political dynamic
                    that was separate from that. Director Wick wanted it, the administration wanted
                    it, and there were people in the German government who very much wanted it so
                    there was a momentum in that sense behind it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Walters feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Walters was onboard with it and I think by the time Walters came in there
                    were lots and lots of other things going on with German and with the situation
                    in Berlin so RIAS continued to be important but it wasn't the sort of lightening
                    rod of concern that it had been for a while. I remember Director Wick came over
                    and met with, oh what was her name, the Minister for Inner German Affairs, who
                    was our “gespracht” partner on matters having to do with Berlin. They were
                    talking about RIAS and German sensitivities toward RIAS. The Germans had
                    political issues with it as well, the American role in Berlin and what the
                    American profile should be in Berlin. So, there was lots and lots of back and
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you came back in '87 you left in '84 did you
                        sense any change in German attitudes, I mean for one thing there is the SS20
                        Pershing sort of thing, did that sort of thing calm down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah it had calmed down. It was still an issue, I don't remember now
                    exactly the timeline in one thing or another but those immediate issues had
                    calmed down. Let's see '87, Reagan was still in power; we were transiting to the
                    Bush administration, all that kind of thing. I think Bush was a good deal more
                    understandable in terms of German political culture than Reagan had been. I
                    think that they felt more comfortable; I think they felt that some of the
                    ideological edge was gone but, of course, we had the Gulf War and that was a
                    big, big deal for Germans. I think the Germans did support us but the fact of
                    going to war over Kuwait and actually having begun to shoot that was something
                    that for young Germans was a big, big stretch. The idea of actually going to
                    war, of actually using the weapons, there was a lot of concern in Germany and I
                    think it was that emotional sense of actually the coalition becoming engaged in
                    violence, force of arms being required to settle this issue. There were peace
                    demonstrations and concern among Germans, lots of concern among Germans when the
                    run up came toward the war. Baker in this very dramatic I think last ditch
                    effort with the Iraqis to avoid actually launching the first air attacks and
                    stuff like that, that was a big deal for the Germans. What was it? Once the
                    shooting actually started there was actually an attack on the embassy and this
                    was I think some automatic weapons fire, AK-47 fire, from across the Rhine River
                    into the embassy in Bonn. What was it? Our press section was hit and it blew up
                    a computer and a bunch of stuff like that. So, it was a difficult period.</p>
                <p>I remember talking to some youth groups, young political groups in Germany about
                    how there is solidarity. This was an invasion of Kuwait by violence and every
                    step has been taken. We've done everything possible but now it has gotten to the
                    point where if there is no alternative what are you going to do? You can't just
                    let this aggression stand. But the whole notion of resorting to armed force was
                    something that the Germans found difficult, difficult, difficult to accept.</p>

                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well turning to the Berlin situation, up until I guess the
                        late summer of '89 were there any bells beginning to ring about what was
                        happening there? How did it evolve, how did our embassy evolve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUDY: The bells rang very slowly. Vernon Walters created something of a stir
                    when he first arrived in Germany. During an initial meeting with the press he
                    was asked a fairly innocuous question, which had to do with can you imagine of
                    Germany ever being united again, or unification happening. Walters answered
                    again very diplomatically that “Yes, he could imagine Germany being reunited at
                    some point in the future. This caused a great hue and cry in the German press
                    because some of the Germans thought that it was really stirring the pot and
                    creating instability and a feeling that we were pushing the GDR government. That
                    this was awakening a lot of ghosts which they didn't want to awaken, that it was
                    being provocative as far as the East, as far as the Soviet Union as far as the
                    GDR was concerned. They feared that it was provocative and the text of the
                    statement then we put out there was much hue and cry about the American
                    ambassador talking about Germany being reunified. But Walters answered the
                    question very diplomatically and there it was. But it indicates, I think, how
                    far off the scope that thought was at the time. German unification, people just
                    didn't think in those terms. I forget exactly when Walters came to Bonn as
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you all get him to clarify what he meant or anything
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: He did it very as I say diplomatically. I think he handled it very well.
                    It was a little tempest in a teapot but it indicates what a hot button issue
                    German unification was. I forget exactly what the clarification was but it was
                    to the effect that, 'Yes, one could imagine or who knew under what circumstances
                    or you know how history would enfold, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a way it was indicated in the German society at
                        that time that they were basically quite happy with the way things were,
                        don't mess around with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Very much a feeling of don't mess around with it and thoughts of German
                    unification being provocative and being destabilizing. I think people felt
                    content with the situation as is, a prosperous and secure Federal Republic and
                    people didn't really worry too much about unification with the East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then what happened with, as events began to unfold or

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Gorbachev made an initial visit to Bonn, as I recall and there was a good
                    deal of concern on the American side that Gorbachev was charming the Germans.
                    That the Gorbachev charm offensive had the danger of splitting NATO or splitting
                    Germany off from solidarity with the alliance and solidarity with the United
                    States. There was a good deal of concern about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gorbymania.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Gorbymania, exactly, exactly. So there was some concern in the embassy and
                    in the American official community in general, folks that were concerned about
                    Germany and the NATO Alliance, that if Gorbachev succeeded what would that mean
                    for the United States and lots of sympathy for Gorbachev among Germans. The
                    Germans I think saw Gorbachev as a breath of fresh air. Who knows what might be
                    possible with this leader of the Soviet Union: a whole new relationship and that
                    concerned people in Germany as well as in the United States. Gorbymania,
                    exactly.</p>
                <p>I have a little bit of a different take on the collapse of the GDR than maybe
                    some people do. I think the demonstrations in Leipzig and Dresden were all very,
                    very important but I think what was really going on and what the handwriting on
                    the wall clearly was. It took a while but not that long to sink in, but when
                    people in the GDR began sensing an opening to the West and the cutting of the
                    barbed wire between Austria and Hungary was on German television. People
                    thought, oh yeah, great between Hungary and Austria now they are cutting the
                    barbed wire, and the Iron Curtain is coming down and tensions are being relaxed.
                    They are not looking across one another at gun barrels anymore but the Austrians
                    are neutral. The Hungarians have always been the more liberal members of the
                    Warsaw Pact so this is not so terribly, terribly unusual. This is a good thing,
                    OK.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>I think among East Germans they looked at that and saw something of a different
                    message. They saw the Iron Curtain falling and they saw what they hadn't seen
                    since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961 — an opportunity to get out. Gradually
                    people, and these were the workers, these weren't the “intelligencia”
                    (intelligence), they were the workers, they were ordinary citizens jumping in
                    their “Trabant” (East German automobile) and driving across Czechoslovakia and
                    driving into Hungary and driving into Austria. You had these, you know they are
                    all in Austria, what the hell are we going to do with them, bring them back to
                    Germany, long convoys and where are we going to put them in Germany and where
                    are we going to resettle them. Then this became a stream, and it was clear that
                    East Germans were going to take advantage of that to an ever-increasing numbers.
                    There was pressure on the Hungarians, I think by the East German government, by
                    the Soviet Union, who knows. I don't know to close the border but that wasn't
                    going to work because once you had clipped the barbed wire you weren't going to
                    put it up again. Then I think for a while wasn't there, I would have to look at
                    the timeline on this, the border between the Czech Republic and Hungary was
                    going to be closed and then Germans started piling up in huge, huge numbers at
                    the West German embassy in Prague and there were negotiations to get them out.
                    They just kept coming and then the East Germans figured out that what are we
                    going to do? We can't very well close our border with the Czech Republic.</p>
                <p>You had the peace demonstrations going on or the demonstrations for
                    liberalization going on in Leipzig and in Dresden to some extent in Berlin as
                    well. So there was just a lot of stuff going on. But, ultimately I think a
                    realization on the part of the GDR government that without the Brezhnev
                    Doctrine, the Brezhnev Doctrine is dead. Gorbachev had come to the 40th
                    anniversary celebration of the German Democratic Republic and his words were
                    widely cited: I think that history will punish those who don't keep up with
                    things, the “geschichte” (present) was something “bestraften” (punish). I forget
                    how this was reported in Germany but anyway this undercut the Honecker position.
                    There was just a general momentum which the political powers that be in the GDR
                    had lost control of. Ultimately the sovereignty of the GDR depended upon the
                    realization that the Brezhnev Doctrine stood and ultimately any attempt to break
                    away from the Warsaw Pact would be put down by force of arms. Well, when it
                    dawned on people that that was no longer the case, the place just fell of its
                    own weight. First of all, the working class streaming out in their Trabants
                    through Hungary into Austria, through to the Czech Republic wherever they could
                    get out. They weren't just...they wanted to get out. Then on the part of the
                    more liberal elements a feeling that there ought to be a more kinder, liberal,
                    socialist Republic of Germany and then I think a feeling that well these people
                    are leaving but maybe if we say something like, “In the future maybe you can get
                    visas to travel and stuff” and of course...</p>

                <p>RUEDY: Orderly departure, yes, something like that. Everybody on this crazy night
                    of what was it, November 11, it was a beautiful night in November with a full
                    moon and unusually mild weather and the word was that there is going to be an
                    opening. There will be possibilities of getting out, that this will change,
                    masses of people going to the wall and nobody shooting anymore. It was just the
                    end of it; it was just the end of it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That's right, you can't stop it, this is just the way it is, yeah. There
                    was just no stopping it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole world is collapsing around you and from the
                        public affairs perspective what was happening as this was unfolding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: The events acquired a dynamic all of their own and things were moving
                    very, very quickly. I remember on the day that the wall fell and all this
                    electrifying news was all over the television and all over the radio I drove
                    home from the embassy toward my apartment in Plittersdorf and picked up my dry
                    cleaning on the way. I remember thinking that gee all of these great events are
                    taking place but I still need some clean shirts and a clean suit. So I picked up
                    my dry cleaning and at that point there was really, I mean watching it on
                    television, just watching events unfold and as far as the press line or anything
                    in Bonn I think we needed to be visible. We needed to be present but the great
                    pronouncements were really coming out of Washington and coming out of the
                    offices in the Federal Republic. We, I think, needed to be cautious about
                    getting in the way, making lots of pronouncements, saying lost of stuff. I mean
                    it wasn't up to the embassy at that point to make a lot of comments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the great points of this Bush I diplomacy with
                        Baker was this whole episode of how it was treated. That it was not turned
                        into a political rally of gee we won another, this was not a flag waving
                        triumphantism exercise. Keeping a fairly low key there which was...from a
                        political type this must...I mean again I'm talking about American political
                        types, this must have been pretty hard not to claim we won, we won?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I agree and I think that the way it was handled in Bonn was very, very
                    good. There was the wisdom and that's exactly the word that I want to use, the
                    wisdom of Ambassador Walters was key because of Walters being this very
                    sovereign presence. He had been everywhere, he had done everything, knew
                    everybody. I think his presence was sort of a calming thing. The impression of
                    the German public was here is somebody who knows what he is doing. He is a
                    statesman, he has been around for a while, he knows what he is doing. I remember
                    at a staff meeting Walters said something, he was always quoting everybody I
                    mean Walters knew everybody and he knew all the quotes. I think this was a quote
                    from Napoleon, “There is nothing more urgent now than to wait.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you feel that Walters, I mean was it pronounced
                        that way or the way 'let's keep our mouths shut, don't go crawling'?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I don't recall hearing specific directions from him to that effect but
                    that was definitely the tenor in the embassy that you needed to avoid great
                    pronouncements or hysteria or cranking out press releases or doing this that or
                    the other. The events had a dynamic and that dynamic was in the right direction
                    and it was difficult to know exactly where things were going to go or how things
                    were going to wind up but there was no violence. I mean this could have had I
                    think horrible consequences. We were terribly, terribly fortunate. I think some
                    of that was just good luck the way things played out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard people say that the whole Honecker thing had
                        been so consumed with making this 30th anniversary such a big deal that he
                        kind of ignored all of this stuff that was going around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't want to stir things up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I think the Honaker regime; they were just incapable of changing. They
                    were just incapable of changing the party line. This was just the way it was so
                    they approached it with blinders and in refusing to recognize what was going on,
                    refusing to recognize the inevitable, not really knowing what to do. Like I say,
                    they couldn't very well close off the borders with the Czech Republic. I think
                    maybe they leaned on the Czechs to do something but what could the Czechs do.
                    The events had acquired a dynamic of their own. I think they were concerned
                    about not provoking violence in places like Leipzig.</p>

                <p>RUEDY: Exactly, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, I forget the name of the church in Leipzig, but yeah. I think the
                    people there were perhaps looking for a kinder, gentler GDR. You had all these
                    demonstrations and Monday night marches or whatever they were. They were trying
                    to keep all of that in check and really you know it didn't compute, it just
                    didn't add up any more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense from your contacts in the Bonn government
                        that they were over their heads or I mean how were they responding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I don't think they were over their heads. I think and I don't know what
                    they were saying to the GDR or you know what kind of communication was going on
                    there. The GDR I think it was clear that any kind of resort to violence in
                    connection with these demonstrations would be pretty catastrophic in terms of
                    the relationship with Bonn and the relationship with the West so they, I think,
                    were wanting to do everything possible to avoid violence. In violence they would
                    clearly be out of step with the Soviet Union, with their great protector, with
                    Gorbachev, with everything else so I think they just saw themselves on the GDR
                    side as up a blind alley. I think the West Germans to the extent that I can
                    gauge that, the government of the Federal Republic was being very restrained
                    about not doing anything that would be provocative or that would bring about any
                    kind of big cataclysm or whatever. They were really I think trying to handle it
                    very, very carefully.</p>
                <p>At the same time not saying anything that was anti the demonstrations or
                    whatever. They were not provoking but not undermining, not undercutting either.
                    They were, I think, treading a pretty fine line and treading it pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the public affairs must have been overwhelmed by
                        news people coming to Berlin weren't they? I mean media from all over the
                        world was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I wasn't in Berlin. We had a public affairs operation in Berlin and I
                    worked with them but the correspondents coming to Berlin to cover the story
                    would not I think have made a point of coming to the U.S. Mission in Berlin to
                    do lots of interviews. I mean the story was out there on the street, it wasn't
                    in sitting down with the American. I think Harry Gilmore was the guy who was
                    there as the head of the U.S. mission in Berlin. Gilmore is certainly very cool
                    and calm and exactly the kind of person who you wanted in a situation like that,
                    so he really knew his way around and like I say I think the story spoke for
                    itself.</p>

                        immediately get caught in the Gulf War didn't you quite quickly after
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Certainly the turmoil of the Gulf War was there also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that do with Germany, I mean, Saddam Hussein
                        invaded Kuwait. I mean you would think Germany becoming very much a pacifist
                        type country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: And that pacifism I think was a factor in the way the German public
                    regarded the events. I think there was first of all outrage about Kuwait.
                    Clearly this was awful and there was no sympathy for Iraq, zero sympathy for
                    Iraq on that score. A feeling that this was clearly terrible, clearly beyond the
                    pale and a sense of disbelief that this could have happened and a sense of even
                    greater disbelief that the west, the United States, allies would have to resort
                    to a force of arms to reverse that aggression. So, no sympathy at all for Iraq
                    but clearly a great hesitation, a great concern about going to war to change it
                    and there I think that pacifist reflex played a very strong role. I think among
                    the French, among the British, among the other people in the alliance that it
                    was not so much a factor but for the Germans it very much was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French normally reject, I mean they weighed in

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the French, did you sense a growing
                        French-German relationship or was this more on the French side than on the
                        German side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, during this period of time I think their relationship was a little bit
                    frosty because the French certainly were not eager to see Germany move quickly
                    toward unification, I think. The German public had that perception. I think
                    among the German public there was a perception that the French were kind of
                    moving toward the inevitable with a certain amount of reluctance, a certain
                    amount of hesitation, a certain amount of trepidation. Maybe a feeling also
                    among the public, I didn't hear this articulated officially at all, but I think
                    among the public the French would just as soon not have this happen and if they
                    saw an opportunity to slow it down or derail it or whatever they very well
                    might. So, it was not a period I think when there was a great feeling that boy
                    the French were really on our side on this.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>RUEDY: That's correct, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did things, I mean was it a different world you
                        were dealing with after the fall of the wall and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, things continued to evolve very rapidly and you know the whole
                    discussion of Germany eventually becoming unified. I think Brandt made a
                    statement that 'what belongs together will grow together', the feeling as a
                    succession of governments took power in East Berlin you know what did all this
                    mean. Would there continue to be a separate GDR? But events just kind of
                    intervened. You had this movement. Kohl obviously saw this opportunity and took
                    it. In retrospect, despite all of the second guessing and despite all of the
                    concern about slow economic growth in Eastern German and high unemployment and
                    the “Osties” (easterners) versus the “Westies” (westerners), I can imagine the
                    way things worked out is not by far and away not the worst of alternatives, not
                    the worst way it could have worked out.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I think that it worked out about as well as it could have, this
                    quite rapid movement toward unification because certainly you had lots of
                    instability and a period of potential turmoil in Eastern Germany. At the same
                    time lots of things were happening inside the Warsaw Pact in Poland and in the
                    Czech Republic and Hungary and everywhere else. So I think the course that
                    events took turned out to be very fortuitous. The first of the talks about the
                    unification of Germany took place in Bonn as I recall and Shevardnadze and
                    Baker, they were all there. This was all a big, big deal and first you had this
                    four power umbrella. It was all very complicated but I think American diplomacy,
                    the whole Baker-Bush approach was ultimately a very measured and careful and
                    wise movement. You had issues around Berlin settled and you had sovereignty
                    turned over to the Germans in the context of German unification and it all
                    worked out. You had a whole host of very, very difficult problems to deal with.
                    The Soviets in East Germany still had about a half million Soviet troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you all doing in public affairs? Was there much
                        involvement or explaining what we were up to or was it business as
                        usual?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Oh, it was a dynamic period. Business as usual but you had lots of visits
                    by VIPs on the American side, secretary of state visits, press releases and
                    support and so on. We were out too as I recall speaking and putting the American
                    policy line forward but not getting in the way. This wasn't something that the
                    Americans were forcing or pushing or whatever, but that we were working
                    diligently and pragmatically and particularly in close coordination with the
                    German side as events unfolded. I think we were concerned about not letting a
                    lot of daylight appear or seem to appear between...we were not driving events
                    toward unification but we weren't pulling the Germans back from it either. This
                    was a culmination of long-standing American policy. I mean what was unfolding
                    was no difference from what we had said from the very beginning we wanted to
                    have happen. It was up to the Germans to make some of these decisions and to
                    work out some of these major issues and certainly to work out the details. We
                    were there not to dictate or not to impose or not to shape things according to
                    our will but to have happen what we said we wanted from the very beginning, the
                    whole concept of containment. This was all part and parcel of what we had been
                    trying to do through the entire cold war period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with your former first tour
                        former job in western Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, very much so. This was interesting because Terry Catherman had left
                    and during my last year there I was working for Cynthia Miller who was an
                    outstanding PAO as well. She was absolutely terrific and she also had been PAO
                    in East Berlin and I had been in East Berlin as APAO. You know the whole
                    relationship between the embassy in Bonn and the Embassy in East Berlin was
                    interesting. The U.S. Mission in West Berlin and quite how this was going to
                    work, how we were going to divvy up responsibilities, how all of this was going
                    to go. From Bonn we were pushing the envelope a little bit because the East
                    German public affairs operation in East Berlin had been pretty tightly
                    circumscribed. We didn't issue a lot of press releases or one thing or another
                    because we couldn't and we felt now that things were changing we ought to really
                    go for it. We were interested in making sure that our materials got out and our
                    press releases got out. There was some issue about whether stuff to Leipzig
                    ought to go out on U.S. Mission Berlin letterhead or Embassy Berlin letterhead.
                    We said “OK, we don't care, do it on Embassy Berlin letterhead but we've got
                    presence in West Berlin and we can crank this stuff out. We've got all this
                    electronic capability and let it all happen and do it under the Embassy Berlin
                    rubric because Leipzig is still part of the GDR. That's all OK but just do it,
                    let it go. Let's get out to those places, let's get involved, let's reach out,
                    clearly the situation is different now than it was a month ago and let's take
                    advantage of that from the public affairs aspect.” We sometimes felt that our
                    colleagues in East Berlin were perhaps more conscious of bureaucratic turf than
                    we would have liked but they had their perspective and we had ours, so what are
                    you going to do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left there unification had taken
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, unification had taken place. We did lots of organizing and
                    reorganizing. Public affairs outreach to the former GDR became a big, big issue
                    for us. We were interested in using our IV allocation to bring lots of people
                    over from the former GDR and doing lots of distribution in that part of the new
                    “Bundeslande” (Federal States). We organized our public affairs effort. We had a
                    very bright, outstanding person who was assigned to the American embassy in the
                    GDR who was going to become a cultural attach�; they were going to establish a
                    cultural attach� position in the GDR. As things imploded by the time she was
                    ready to come to Berlin, there was no more GDR to be cultural attach� to so she
                    was the BPAO in, we assigned her to be BPAO in Leipzig. We were going to open an
                    America House in Leipzig. She had responsibility for finding a building in
                    Leipzig where we could open an America House and do a bunch of this stuff. The
                    BPAO in Hamburg and the BPAO in Hanover we decided, just for the sake of
                    coverage, to ask them to cover Magdeburg and to cover some of the other
                    important cities in the northern part of the GDR. We were busy redrawing the map
                    and getting people new responsibilities and putting lots and lots of emphasis on
                    outreach to what we called the new “Bundeslande”.</p>
                <p>For me it was great because here it was the possibility to get back to some of
                    these places I thought I would never visit again by going to Leipzig, going to
                    Dresden and going to some of these other places, Magdeburg and so on. Just
                    getting a sense of what we ought to do there by way of a field operation, what
                    we could do and you know just meeting with people. It was wonderful; it was a
                    great way to end the tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that you know you were beginning to
                        expand your operations into the new lands and beyond there that the West
                        German government now the Federal government for the whole place was sort of
                        saying 'you are messing around in our turf and don't get too active sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>RUEDY: No, no I never had that sense. They welcomed our presence. We were the
                    foreign country after all, we were the Americans so I don't think that there was
                    any sense of competing for influence in the GDR. We wanted to avoid that too for
                    the West Germans. I think in the waning days of the GDR this was something that
                    we watched very carefully as well. We didn't want to seem to be propping up or
                    lending more credibility to the GDR than they deserved. It was a dynamic
                    situation; we didn't quite know whether they were in free-fall or not but if
                    they were in free-fall we didn't want to be seen as propping them up or giving
                    them credibility. There were a couple of instances, I forget, I think Baker
                    talked to one of the interim GDR leaders in Potsdam or something like that, it
                    didn't amount to a whole lot. I forget who recommended what to whom but in
                    retrospect it was not a big deal, but there was some discussion about whether it
                    was really appropriate for the American sectary of state to meet with this
                    rump-state GDR leader when we had been stiff-arming Honecker for years for very
                    good reason. Now we were seeming to support the continued existence of a
                    separate sovereign GDR. Like I said I would have to look at the time line of
                    that again because it was a rather busy period when lots of stuff was going on
                    in very quick succession. I think the overall arch of American policy was pretty
                    clear and that was to not get in the way of what was happening in terms of
                    inner-German relations and inner-German affairs and to do what we had said we
                    were going to do from the very beginning, support a reunified Germany at some
                    point in time on German terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then in '91 you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I came back to Washington and went to a great assignment in the bureau of
                    education and cultural affairs as deputy chief of the Fulbright program. I did
                    continue to be involved with Germany because Germany was at that point the
                    largest Fulbright program that we had anywhere thanks in large part, thanks
                    completely to the tremendous support that the Fulbright program got from the
                    German government. A generation of Germans had grown to cherish and love the
                    German Fulbright program and as we withdrew support for it the Germans increased
                    their support. So the binational Fulbright program when I left Germany and went
                    to this office I think was about $4 million which made it by far the largest
                    program and $3 million of that was German money and we wouldn't have been
                    continuing to kick in a $1 million but the Germans kind of shamed us by upping
                    their anti so we kept ours at a larger level than I think we otherwise would
                    have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '91 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Let's see, I was there for three years altogether, from '91 to '94.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Fulbright program beginning to fade away in other
                        places or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, it was. It had been fading away from a lot of places unfortunately
                    for a lack of financial support from the American side. It was a period when I
                    think foreign countries welcomed the Fulbright program; many foreign countries,
                    partner countries, contributed to the Fulbright program in a substantial way. It
                    was very much a binational program with binational commissions and wonderful
                    binational directors in many of the countries. So it really was, I think, unique
                    among academic exchange programs that I know of, a binational effort between us
                    and the Brazilians or between us and the Hungarians, between us and the Spanish
                    and it being a binational commission with a binational board of directors, and a
                    binational director. But, unfortunately, American support for it was always
                    very, very difficult. We worked very hard to keep up the American side of the
                    bargain, but it was tough especially in a period when appropriations were going
                    down, the Cold War had been won. There was not great fundamental enthusiasm on
                    the Hill from the geo-political standpoint for maintaining this program. There
                    were lots of people who liked it, I mean nobody disliked Fulbright, everybody
                    thought it was a great program but people were looking for peace dividends and
                    people were looking for budget cuts and why are you doing all of this binational
                    stuff and the Cold War is over. We explained to people that the Fulbright
                    program never was a Cold War program that it really always was a program to
                    promote mutual understanding and the wonderful statement of purpose to the
                    original Fulbright legislation in 1961 whatever and there was some support for
                    Fulbright. I think we kept up a pretty good front but it was a difficult
                    battle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
                        emergence of all those states out of the Soviet Union put additional burdens
                        on the Fulbright program or how was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes it put additional burdens on the budget because the budget tended to
                    be a very much zero sum situation. We did get some modest increases. We didn't
                    really have a terribly dynamic leadership within USIA, this was not a Director
                    Wick era. However much he might be criticized for lack of political finesse as I
                    heard Director Wick say at one point, “I don't know that much about
                    international politics but I know a lot about making a deal.” He was good at
                    that, give him credit, he was good at that and he was good at wringing out
                    budget support for public diplomacy programs and he was good at playing the
                    political game inside Washington. He was good at capitalizing on his direct
                    relationship with the President and with Nancy and all that kind of thing. Later
                    on I think the leadership in USIA was a lot less dynamic and it was a lot less
                    forceful and it had a lot less credibility on capital Hill, or at the NSC or the
                    White House. I think exchange programs suffered as a result, public diplomacy
                    programs in general and academic exchange programs in particular suffered. We
                    did have some support for these programs on the Hill and the Hill, I think,
                    usually wound up giving the Fulbright program and other exchange programs more
                    money than the administration and USIA leadership was willing to ask for. So we
                    kind of kept body and soul together but yeah, there were demands and we were
                    eager to satisfy them. We established Fulbright commissions with the Czech
                    Republic, with Hungary, with Poland and they were all eager for large programs
                    and we didn't have a whole lot of money but at least we got things going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then who was the director at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Joseph Duffy. He came from the academic area and we had high hopes. I mean
                    here was an academic type who was really going to go to bat for the Fulbright
                    program. But there was not I don't think a lot of dynamism there frankly and I
                    don't think that he had much credibility on the Hill. There were a couple of
                    exchanges between Duffy and Senator Biden which indicated that there was just
                    not a whole lot of connection there. We were beginning to work another angle and
                    doing so quite successfully and that was the funding from the Freedom Support
                    Act. A large amount of money was coming into the AID (Agency for International
                    Development) budget for programs to support the activities in the former Soviet
                    Union. There were some very, very sharp people in that Freedom Support Act
                    office. I think they saw the importance of things like academic exchange
                    programs and revamping the university structure in those countries. They saw in
                    programs like Fulbright and other academic programs that were run by USIA
                    programs also in my office to train graduate students and stuff like that, they
                    saw that as a good place to put their money. So we began getting fairly large
                    amounts of money from the Freedom Support Act to support Fulbright clone type
                    programs basically putting programs on the Fulbright model. We would
                    vociferously deny this but we were often asked whether we weren't using Freedom
                    Support Act money to support programs that USIA base funding should be
                    supporting. I mean the short answer was, yes, we were doing that because the
                    base budget simply wasn't there. We were getting a fair amount of money from the
                    Freedom Support Act to do these things. Shouldn't we be taking money from the
                    budget in Germany and in France and in Spain and diverting it to Kazakhstan and
                    maybe I suppose we should have but we needed programs in Germany and Spain and
                    the UK as well. They were stripped down to bare bones also and stripping them
                    even further wouldn't...so there was a lot of sort of maybe slight of hand. But
                    we were able to keep basic programs going in most of the places where we needed
                    basic programs and we were able to ramp up programs in the countries of the
                    former Soviet Union as well, mostly thanks to Freedom Support Act money. The
                    people who were running the Freedom Support Act saw that what we had been doing
                    for years under the Fulbright program, bringing over graduate students and
                    training junior faculty, were exactly what they ought to be doing to promote
                    democratization and free market development in the countries of the former
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way there had to be the ones that had been going in
                        the Soviet Union for example as I recall they were quite heavily into the
                        scientific field and had been going to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>RUEDY: They had been. After the breakup of the Soviet Union all of those concerns
                    about sending over physicists and chemists kind of subsided. We were able really
                    to do much more on our own instead of negotiating everything between the
                    American embassy or between Washington and under the umbrella of a cultural
                    agreement. We would explain that in countries where we had long-standing
                    programs and great cultural relations, we never had cultural agreements and just
                    let things happen and let people exchange and let people go back and forth.
                    We've got these tremendous programs and for the most part those governments did
                    not exercise the kind of veto power they did in the old Soviet era. There were
                    some rumblings about establishing cultural agreements but the last thing that we
                    wanted were these carefully negotiated cultural agreements, which really
                    circumscribed what we were able to do. In a number of places we came up with
                    over-arching statements of principals that we were all for academic exchange and
                    all kinds of exchange, the more the merrier. We would try to assist in that
                    rather than limiting it and not be a funnel for these kinds of things anymore,
                    being the tight end of the funnel where things got watched but just to expedite
                    and to free up stuff and the more the better.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left...how about Duffy, did he pay much
                        attention to what you were doing. Did you feel his hand very much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Not really no, no, on Fulbright, no. He would as I recall give a speech if
                    that's what it amounted to but I didn't get the sense of overwhelming
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who were there around that time and
                        the feeling about Duffy as being not, as you say, not dynamic or even really
                        not very interested and sort of looking like what are we doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes it was a sad period for USIA because I think we were getting hammered
                    on the budget year after year and we were looking for leadership and looking for
                    somebody to articulate a mission and that certainly could have been done but I
                    don't think it was coming out of the leadership that we had at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is probably a good place to stop. You left there
                        in '95 or when was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I left there in '94 and went into a year of Russian language training and
                    then went to the American embassy in Moscow from '95-'97.</p>

                <p>Today is the 10th of May 2005. Ralph how did you find Russian?</p>
                <p>RUEDY: I found Russian difficult and I knew it would be. I'm not a particularly
                    gifted linguist. I learned German the easy way from my grandfather and my
                    parents growing up but Russian was something else again. I knew that I wasn't
                    the gifted language student because I had struggled with Vietnamese before going
                    to Vietnam in the Navy and then later had some training in Persian and Farsi as
                    well before going to Iran, just a basic courtesy level but those experiences let
                    me know that language came more easily to other people sometimes than it did to
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you when you were taking this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Oh my, I was in my fifties. I was in my mid-fifties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are a little bit late, as you are supposed to learn it
                        before you hit twenty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That's absolutely right. But I came to the assignment in Russia more or
                    less as serendipity because my wife is a Foreign Service officer as well and we
                    were looking around for tandem assignments to go overseas. Tandem assignments
                    are very difficult to find and they are generally available at larger embassies
                    and of course Rome and Paris and London are a little bit more difficult to get.
                    There was nothing available at any of those places but the personnel list in
                    Moscow indicated two appropriate openings. We bid on them and off we went. I
                    must admit I had no particular interest in studying Russian or in Russian
                    history or things Russian. I had never served in that part of the world so I
                    didn't really know what to expect. My wife had had some background. She had had
                    some Russian language in college and also studied Russian literature and Russian
                    history and fond that all very interesting so I thought well I'll do my best and
                    off we will go to Moscow and do Russian language. I found Russian language tough
                    but you take the Woody Hayes approach to language learning. You hit it each
                    morning and a cloud of dust and three yards and you hope you get a first down
                    and make it to the next step and that's what happened. I did my year of Russian
                    language and it was tough but I came out of it with a 3-3 and I suppose there
                    are 3-3s and there are 3-3s. In some cases one clears the high bar elegantly and
                    in other cases one makes it to the top and the bar is jiggling and you wind up
                    in the dust taking a deep breath and maybe I fell into the latter category.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was there from '95-'97. I got there in July approximately of '95 and
                    left there in July of '97.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was deputy public affairs officer and we had a very large USIS
                    operation, certainly the largest in the world. We had quite large programs
                    thanks to the Freedom Support Act. By this time USIA funding and USIA leadership
                    and USIA everything was pretty much in tatters. But, in that part of the world,
                    thanks to the Freedom Support Act, we had very, very large programs, which
                    relied on sort of clones of programs that USIA had been doing successfully for
                    years. We had a very large program for example to bring graduate students to the
                    United States to study law, business administration, economics and
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is brand new because prior to that they had all gone
                        over to study science.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That is correct, they had wanted to study science and selected only people
                    that were absolutely reliable and all the rest of it. Here we basically did our
                    own selection, we ran our own selection progress working with a couple of really
                    good NGOs (non-governmental organizations) Acter and IREX who had lots of
                    experience in that part of the world. Anyway, we conducted these programs and
                    they were frankly clones of the Fulbright graduate program, the same basic
                    mechanisms, the same basic approach, the same basic selection criteria. We got
                    some really, really good people, bright young people that would come to the
                    States for a year and in many cases in that year earn a masters degree. They
                    just did really well, spoke good English and all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been an exciting time, you had not been an
                        old Soviet hand but I mean things had really just had been uncorked there.
                        Could you describe kind of the working atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It is absolutely true, uncorked is a good description because suddenly all
                    kinds of things were possible. The Russians were friendly and interested though
                    some of the Russian officials were a little bit standoffish and some of them
                    tended to be kind of stuck in the bureaucratic mechanism of the past. I remember
                    one go-around that we had with the ministry of culture. They had perceived that
                    the cultural agreement that we had signed way back in Soviet days had expired
                    and the cultural agreements were very, very detailed lists of what they would do
                    and what we would do. The cultural agreements tended actually to circumscribe
                    reciprocal cultural activities, so we didn't really want a cultural agreement
                    but they insisted on it. It expired and they needed a new one, it was just the
                    way it was done. So we worked out not a cultural agreement but a statement of
                    principles or something like that I think we called it. It basically called for
                    just lots and lots of contact and the governments not getting in the way of that
                    but encouraging it and working to facilitate it whenever possible, that is what
                    we were trying to do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the people who were working for the embassy, the
                        Russians, for your thing, how did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: We had terrific Russian employees and I think that was the mainstay of our
                    capacity in Russia. We had a good group of Foreign Service officers. It was
                    still USIS at that point, a large USIS operation and I think we had 14, 15
                    officers, 15 Americans all together and probably 40 or 50 Russian employees. The
                    Russian employees were outstanding; some of them had master's degrees and some
                    had experience in the United States but not in all the cases. But, I think they
                    also shared a commitment really to engagement with the West and engagement with
                    the United States. They were interested in the U.S. and they felt as good
                    Russians it was important for them to do this. So, they were outstanding, very
                    energetic, great cooperation and that went from everybody from the senior
                    cultural people to the drivers some of whom spoke a little bit of English, many
                    of whom didn't but they were just all a joy to work with, they were just great
                    folks to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working on the cultural side is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I was working on both the press and the cultural side. The PAO who was
                    Paul Smith my first year and Bob Gosende the second year. I was chief operating
                    officer or something like that. So, I was the person that was making the trains
                    run on time or trying to within that big organization. I perhaps put it into too
                    glossy terms but I tried to get out as much as possible as well and participate
                    in programs and have lots and lots of contact with Russians. Basically my job
                    was to keep the operation running and to worry about things like budgets and
                    country plans which we were still doing and mission program plans and pulling
                    all that kind of stuff together and making sure that the mail from Washington
                    got answered. I made sure that the reporting that we were supposed to be doing
                    on our exchange programs and all that stuff was getting done so it was a good
                    job, I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about did you have much contact one way or the other
                        with the Russian universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, yes we did. That was a big area that we were interested in and
                    concerned about and most of that went to the cultural attach�. Rosemary DiCarlo
                    was cultural attach� and she is an old Soviet hand, really outstanding,
                    excellent Russian, had a PhD. in Russian literature or Russian art, really a
                    strong background. Some of the people in the section in USIS did. Paul Smith who
                    was my boss as PAO had excellent Russian, which he learned in the army and later
                    on, had served in exhibits in the old Soviet Union, traveling exhibits and all
                    that stuff so he really knew the territory. As I say, great people to work with
                    and learn from. I felt a little bit of an outsider to that Soviet club but I
                    found the assignment tremendously, tremendously rewarding. I had talked about
                    how I looked at going to Russia and Russian language with a little bit of
                    trepidation, who needs this at this point in my career but just getting over
                    there the culture was so immensely rich and Russian art and Russian literature
                    and Russian history and religion and everything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In going to the universities, did you get the feeling that
                        they were sort of restructuring themselves? I mean it had been the Soviet
                        system and then all of a sudden things were opening up and things were based
                        on a Marxist course. I can't think off anybody who would be less desired
                        than a professor of Marxist theory or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I think some of the professors of Marxist theory were left out in the
                    cold. Others in economics or people in other fields were looking around and
                    seeing new possibilities and new opportunities. The younger ones I think shared
                    in that excitement and the dynamism. There was a massive restructuring. I think
                    the Russians, were just really excellent at muddling through. They would
                    improvise, they would kind of figure out a way and they would make it work. I
                    grew tremendously admiring of the way the Russians were able to cope, were able
                    to do things and that certainly was called upon in the situation that existed in
                    '95-'97. Universities had been teaching organizations with a heavily
                    Marxist/Leninist outlook. Obviously they were teaching students to be good
                    Marxist/Leninists. Serious research was conducted not by university professors
                    but by people in the academy of sciences or the academy of arts, that is where
                    the art or where the science or where the research got done. These organizations
                    were massively funded by the old Soviet government as well. That funding was
                    drying up so you had these old institutes and these wonderful 19th century
                    buildings in Moscow, which were desperately improvising to keep body and soul
                    together. A couple of the institutes I remember had rented space to American
                    companies that were coming over. IBM (International Business Machines) and
                    others would need space so they would rent office space in these prestigious old
                    institute buildings and I had the impression of sort of the southern plantation
                    or whatever now no longer prospering, renting out rooms in order to produce some
                    cash flow to keep the place going.</p>

                <p>RUEDY: Yes that's right, exactly. That applied especially in the arts. My
                    daughter took trumpet lessons there from a guy that we got to know pretty well
                    who was a world-class trumpet teacher. He was basically trying to keep his
                    faculty and keep his organization going and the way he did that was to teach
                    students who could pay him in marks or in dollars and then he also had pretty
                    good German. He spoke no English but he had pretty good German so we
                    communicated mostly in German. He then had all kinds of connections in Germany
                    and basically would spend maybe half the year in Germany performing or doing
                    stuff and I think earning enough money to keep the institute at the organization
                    that he was attached to, going. He had a couple of really good students and the
                    good students would find jobs in Germany or even in the United States, in one
                    case, and you know one thing or another. But people were tremendously
                    resourceful about doing stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it apparent that there were people who were being left
                        out, one thinks of the pensioners, army personnel and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Very much so. We saw the pensioners, these little old ladies who would
                    knit stuff and sell it in the subway or out on the streets when the temperature
                    was ten or fifteen below zero. I remember one memorable sight. People were
                    always selling stuff. I remember walking past one guy who was selling, what,
                    three frozen fish and four beets he had laid out in front of him and that's what
                    he was trying to sell. You had the feeling of tremendous want and need and real
                    struggle on the part of a lot of people as well and your heart would go out to
                    those people.</p>
                <p>I worked with the Protestant Chaplaincy, my whole family did. The Protestant
                    Chaplaincy had a wonderful program, soup kitchens basically, of providing a hot
                    meal every day I think at a number of locations around Moscow. The people that
                    came in were usually older people, pensioners who just didn't have any money and
                    we would dish out a nice bowl of soup to them. It was a clean well lighted place
                    where they could come and eat and they came by the hundreds. Some of these were
                    old army veterans that were wearing their medals and stuff and you thought, man,
                    these people have been there and done that and you had tremendous admiration for
                    them but here they were kind of left high and dry when the world had changed,
                    everything had changed. I had that strong feeling a lot. You would hear stories
                    from people. I remember a college professor that I got to know. She told me that
                    she had warned her elderly mother that the ruble is collapsing, take your money
                    out of the bank account and buy stuff, buy stuff because it's not going to be
                    worth anything. She had a pretty good savings, I don't recall the amount, but
                    she said my mother this is just the way she was, she had the money in the
                    account and that it earned three and four percent and that's the way it had
                    always been and she couldn't get her mind wrapped around the idea that it
                    wouldn't always be that way. So basically the money that she had sold in her old
                    age within a period of weeks, months, went to where it wouldn't pay for a
                    hamburger at the new McDonalds.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Absolutely, and from the public affairs standpoint, form the public
                    diplomacy standpoint we were acutely aware of that. We were acutely aware that
                    this was not the time for crowing or it wasn't a time for humiliation or
                    whatever. It was a time for a new start and I don't know, there are different
                    theories on who won the Cold War and why. But it also, I think, represents a
                    huge victory on the part of a new generation of Russian people and I think lots
                    of younger knew that the old system was not working. The old system was not
                    working and they probably did as much to get rid of it as anybody. I don't know,
                    you can give lots of credit to Reaganomics and missile business and so on but I
                    think lots of young Russians just realized that it had to change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well basically the system itself collapsed so it was in a

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I agree with you. A good friend of mine, an American who has done a lot of
                    Russian watching said that he felt that basically the old system had continued
                    to gain legitimacy for much longer than it could have or should have or earned
                    that legitimacy by claiming the legacy of the victory of World War II. The Great
                    Patriotic War had been such an absolutely draining and emotionally overwhelming
                    experience for Russia. With 27 million dead all the rest...you would see that in
                    the last few days with Putin still reviewing the troops on Red Square.</p>

                <p>RUEDY: Yeah, but this guy felt that the old Soviet system had gained legitimacy
                    or continued to have a hold on the Russian people because of the searing
                    experience of World War II which they had won. Then when that World War II
                    generation, the people who had been through that and had been branded with this
                    patriotism of the great patriotic war, when that generation was replaced by a
                    new generation who had that from the history books but not from personal
                    experience, this generation was willing to look at the Soviet system and say the
                    hell with it, this system is not working, this system is not doing anything.

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Oh yeah. That was going great guns and new newspapers were being founded
                    and all kinds of stuff was going on. It was a period when things were pretty,
                    well really open. It was the period too when this was sort of below my radar
                    screen one had a sense that it was going on but this was a time when resources
                    were being sold off, privatization, it was a period when fortunes were being
                    made overnight.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: The robber barons. When a guy who was really, really fast on his feet and
                    really in touch with things could wind up controlling half the worlds tin supply
                    if you knew what you were doing and if you were willing to do whatever you
                    needed to do to get there. It was an amazing period, an amazing era and I think
                    I don't know, freedom of the press, freedom of speech all that stuff, I mean in
                    the abstract, yeah, absolutely important I have no doubt about that.</p>
                <p>A lot of media stuff was being done also to provide mouthpieces. I think there
                    was also a kind of overhang of Marxist era, how you did things under the Marxist
                    system because agitprop and making people aware. I mean this is a big thing for
                    a doctrinaire Marxist and control of the media and shaping public opinion this
                    is important. I think some of the people who made fortunes very quickly also
                    realized that in order to hold onto those fortunes they had to make their voices
                    heard. They had to, not propaganda in a negative sense, but they couldn't just
                    stand by and sit on their money. They had to be engaged, they had to be involved
                    and they had to help create political conditions that would nurture the kinds of
                    things that they were involved in, put it that way. So people that were
                    organizing free media, I mean well it's never quite as idealistic I suppose as
                    one projects. These weren't John Peter Zenger types who were interested in free
                    speech in the abstract. These were people with very definite political opinions
                    that they wanted to put out there. I don't know, maybe part of the read on Putin
                    is an attempt to roll back some of that and overreacting to it. I don't approve
                    of a lot of what Putin's been doing in the last year or two years, but I think
                    when Putin came to power he maybe had a sense of rolling back some of what he
                    saw as the power that had accumulated in private hands rather than in the
                    government hands.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I was there for the big election, in '96 I think it was, when there was much
                    concern about the communists coming back and Yeltsin being tossed out or support
                    for him being much reduced because of the economic conditions we've talked
                    about. There was general disgust and distrust of the privatization process and a
                    feeling among many people that things had gone fundamentally off the rails so
                    there was real concern that the communists would come back. I think in the
                    mythology that Putin and others maybe bought into it was the media and the media
                    portrayal of Yeltsin during that very pivotal election campaign that really
                    produced their mindset that the media won it for Yeltsin. The media are the
                    folks that kept the communists from coming back and out of that grew maybe an
                    exaggerated sense of the role that the media played in shaping public opinion
                    and voter opinion in the new Russia. There did, I think, emerge this myth that
                    it was the way the media strongly backed the Yeltsin camp and the “liberals” or
                    “reformers” or “free market economic types” that kept the communists from making
                    a comeback in that crucial election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense that the new cliquey informed people were
                        getting their news from CNN (Cable News Network) and from BBC (British
                        Broadcasting Corporation) and just other news sources and the Internet? Was
                        the new generation coming in that was well plugged into the world net as
                        they call it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Yes, yeah, Russians are very smart and you had one hundred percent
                    literacy. One of the things that the communists obviously did was to have this
                    excellent educational system that reached down to everybody. Young people were
                    very literate and very plugged in and very internationally minded. I'm a real
                    novice coming into this but the old westernizer versus the Russophile thing that
                    the Russian history 101 sort of starts with I think you felt that yeah this was
                    very true. On the one hand the great sense of reaching out and being
                    international and reaching out to the international community and being
                    Europeans and being part of the world. On the other hand a sense of Russia's
                    special place and Russia as a special mission, Russia with a special soul,
                    Russia with a special mentality, something that made Russians special. I think
                    there was that kind of thing going on even among young people who were defining
                    the new Russianness, what it meant to be Russian in the post-Soviet period. They
                    were plugged in internationally and at the same time I think they saw themselves
                    as wanting to find, wanting to forge a separate, unique Russian way and again I
                    think that's what is going on now with Russia today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know one of the things about the Soviet Union
                        and some of the other eastern European countries, particularly the Soviet
                        Union is that all the news is about Moscow or St. Petersburg or all of that
                        but you go 20 miles out of the Moscow limits and you are back in the 14th
                        century where women are wearing yolks to carry their water. Did you get out,
                        I mean, I'm not talking about the other cities but out in the countryside?
                        What was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I didn't get out as much as I wanted to. One of the big emphases we made
                    in public diplomacy in USIS was to expand from Moscow and St. Petersburg. We
                    made particular efforts to do stuff outside of the two major cities where there
                    had been some western contact. We established American corners, little
                    mini-libraries. This was not a kind of thing that Washington in those days at
                    USIA was in favor of. We had given up the outreach libraries, but in Russia,
                    that is what you really needed. So we established these little American corners
                    where there was a computer connection and that was major and also a small
                    collection of books and things like that. Every once in a while we would try to
                    get out and do a little program there, do a little speaker or a film or
                    something like that. I forget how many American corners we established but we
                    tried to, I think we had about a dozen or so. We had put a branch public affairs
                    officer out in Vladivostok before I got there. I made it out to Vladivostok a
                    couple of times, up to Khabarovsk and places out there a little bit in the
                    Russian far east. One thing that the PAO and I felt strongly about was the
                    importance of putting a branch public affairs officer in Ekaterinburg as well.
                    We had had a small consulate there but no public affairs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sverdlovsk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Sverdlovsk, in the Urals. So anyway, we wanted to put a branch public
                    affairs officer at the very small consulate in Ekaterinburg. Washington fought
                    us tooth and nail on that because this is a period of downsizing and USIA is
                    getting more budget cuts and so on. But we finally got a BPAO out there. I think
                    we had to give up a position in Moscow and give up two positions in St.
                    Petersburg but we did get a BPAO out in Ekaterinburg. The people that we had as
                    BPAOs in all of the cities were excellent, fluent Russian speakers and they got
                    out and about a lot. So we were doing the kind of outreach to the Russian
                    hinterland that we needed to do. I got out there as much as I could but in
                    general we encouraged the staff to travel. We even set more or less arbitrarily
                    limits that of the people that go on Muskie grants this year only x-percentage
                    can be from Moscow and St. Petersburg. You got to get people from the provincial
                    universities and you've got to get people from here, there and everywhere. We
                    were as I say pretty successful doing that.</p>

                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Conditions out there were a lot worse than in Moscow. A lot was going on
                    in Moscow and St. Petersburg but those other places were struggling. We were
                    working pretty closely with AID and AID had a pretty good program where they
                    would identify areas where the local administration was particularly amenable to
                    change and reform and doing things. Instead of putting a little bit here and a
                    little bit there across this vast Russian region you would pick out particular
                    cities or particular regions that showed promise. The idea was that you would
                    get something going there and that would create a spark and that worked I think
                    in places like Saratov and Nizhny Novgorod and Novgorod near St. Petersburg was
                    another site that was picked out for that. Those things worked and you know you
                    sensed that stuff was happening. Other places where the provincial authority,
                    the local authority was backward leaning or corrupt or just not with it very
                    much things just weren't happening. That applied certainly in Vladivostok. There
                    was always talk about Vladivostok becoming this great place on the Pacific, and
                    you got out there and you thought this is not doing too well. Khabarovsk on the
                    other hand seemed to be doing better, interesting. Some of those places had been
                    closed cities and no westerner had gotten into places like Nizhny Novgorod
                    because you were right on the Volga. I think they were building submarines in
                    Nizhny Novgorod somebody told me and certainly Vladivostok, the big Pacific
                    port, was another place that was closed to westerners.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've seen pictures showing the fleet just rusting away. In

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: For me it was interesting because in Vladivostok out there just on the
                    hill below the consulate were a couple of Russian cruisers, Russian destroyers
                    that were just sitting there. They hadn't gotten underway in years and they
                    probably couldn't get them underway now. These were the kinds of ships when I
                    was an Ensign in the United States Navy serving on board my destroyer in the
                    Mediterranean guarding...on the screen around the carrier we would be looking
                    through our binoculars at those guys looking with their binoculars at us. They
                    were at that time making a big effort to mount a naval presence in the
                    Mediterranean and the Pacific and everywhere. They were there and now they were
                    tied up along the rusty pier in Vladivostok and like I say I don't think you
                    could get up steam in those ships any more.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Americans in Russia, exchange professors, not
                        tourists but others who were coming with NGOs and all that. What was your
                        impression of their impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Generally speaking very, very positive. We had a number of people who were
                    working with NGOs that were helping to administer our exchange programs. They
                    call it American Councils because they continue to be active in other countries
                    of the former Soviet Union. Of course if you are a teacher of Russian in Ukraine
                    or a teacher of Russian in Kazakhstan that doesn't win you many points so they
                    had kind of reinvented themselves and done that very successfully. But Actor had
                    a lot of young people in different locations across Russia. They were helping us
                    open our American corners and recruiting for our Muskie program and youth
                    exchange programs. IREX had people out in the field. The American Peace Corps
                    was active. We had a number of Peace Corps volunteers and others, academic
                    types. There were a couple of universities that were trying to launch university
                    partnerships with different Russian universities. I was in general impressed
                    with the effort that they were making and also the success that they were having
                    and the reception that they got among the Russians. I was surprised there wasn't
                    more of a residue of suspicion among the Russians but the Russians were pretty
                    open to it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I've often thought of that: that maybe both the Russians and the Americans
                    define ourselves in terms of the great centers of European culture, but not
                    really. We feel that we have a separate, unique identity and a unique dynamism
                    and an energy and a soul or whatever that these Europeans don't have any
                    more.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've got this big open space to keep moving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly and the Russians have the same mentality. I think at the same time
                    the Russians, who were they, the Narodniki or whatever were talking about our
                    unique separate...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the people during the beginning of the 20th

                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>RUEDY: At the same time they were making a plea for own separate Russian identity
                    and literature and culture. You had guys like Ralph Waldo Emerson saying that
                    here in the Untied States we have to create an American literature, which is
                    separate from European literature. We are a worthy culture on our own and we
                    have an American music to find our way to and an American way of doing things.
                    So there is that identity and the Russians would often cite that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see much impact with George Soros and his

                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I did yes. Soros was doing good things and we would work with them. I
                    don't have enough knowledge to really speak to that with authority but the Open
                    Society Institute was doing some good things and we were certainly trying to
                    accomplish the same things. I did have the impression sometimes and I can't
                    really cite any specifics here that the attention span was a little shorter than
                    what needed to be done. The Open Society Institute would get very interested in
                    this that or the other and pump money into it for a year or two but then pull
                    back from it a little bit and I think that it required a commitment for the long
                    haul, let's put it that way. But no they were doing good things, as were other
                    organizations that were there. Even now through the Moscow Protestant
                    Chaplaincy, these were the people who sponsored the soup kitchens, I got to know
                    a number of Canadian Mennonites who were working with the Mennonite communities
                    in Siberia and they were doing good work too. It was not proselytizing or
                    whatever but it was economic development. It was establishing agriculture, new
                    basis for agriculture, agriculture prosperity and stuff like that. So there were
                    lots of people doing good things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of its difficult nuts to crack in Russia would
                        be the agriculture side. They destroyed the peasantry, had these collective
                        farms which we sort of collectivized our agriculture all over the world too
                        but these ones were not efficient producers and the transportation system
                        stinks and you know the delivery system...did you get involved in this at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, not really. I was interested in it because I grew up in Iowa in a
                    little agricultural town. I remember talking to a bunch of people, economists
                    and others that were involved in agriculture or people who are now English
                    teachers or English professors who had grown up on a collective farm or their
                    dad was the chief of the collective farm. But no, I agree with you that
                    agriculture was an area that was pretty much of a disaster and required major
                    restructuring. I don't really have much of a sense of how successful they were
                    at going about that. We did bring some people over in agricultural economics but
                    I can't really speak with very much knowledge about that.</p>

                        we have all these Christian groups and often very na�ve and to my mind
                        rather primitive types of not quite snake handlers but, I mean whatever you
                        want to call to the far right or the far left of the Protestant religious
                        spectrum, very fundamentalists and all that. Did you see any impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I didn't see much impact. I didn't have any contact with any of them.
                    There were a few that passed through the Protestant Chaplaincy and you would get
                    to meet them and chat. The Protestant Chaplaincy was interesting because it was
                    non-denominational. The people running it were Presbyterians basically but they
                    were retired and doing this for a couple of years. A lot of the people who came
                    were Africans, African students actually who had come to Russia on scholarship
                    back in the old Soviet days and they were going to study Marxism and go back to
                    Ethiopia or wherever but were then kind of left high and dry. So there were some
                    interesting cases along that line. Lots of third world types in general that
                    would come to worship so their services were interesting, you got to meet some
                    interesting people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find yourself who were doing commands against
                        the Russian Orthodox Church, which tends to be pretty conservative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I didn't come up against it. I knew that the Russian Orthodox Church was
                    not happy with proselytizing by American groups. Not many people who were
                    involved with the Chaplaincy were Russians. Only a very few that were Russians.
                    We had some interesting contacts actually with some people from the Russian
                    Orthodox Church both informal and formal.</p>
                <p>I remember once before Easter my daughter who speaks pretty good Russian and her
                    sister were over at the Russian Orthodox Church that was directly across from
                    the embassy compound in Moscow. During the whole Soviet period it was
                    affectionately referred to as our Radiant Lady of Perpetual Watchfulness or
                    something like that because it had been taken over by the KGB (State Security
                    Committee). With the steeple there was an excellent capacity for listening in on
                    what was going on at the embassy. The radiation stuff wasn't going on anymore
                    but there was some speculation that that is where it was coming from or at least
                    where some of it came from. But anyway, my daughter and her sister were over
                    there before Easter and got into a conversation with a couple of the young
                    priests and they gave them a guided tour of the church and said, “Here we are
                    rebuilding, this all used to be electronics and stuff like that.” They were very
                    friendly and very forthcoming and in a number of other cases I would just wander
                    into a church and get into a conversation with a Russian Orthodox clergy and
                    they would be very friendly, approachable and have questions and I would have
                    questions and we would have a good exchange to the extent that my language
                    permitted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about while you were there the security situation, one
                        the old KGB residue, were they messing around and then just plain the
                        security with criminality, was that a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Embassy visitors were warned about it and one group that we were warned
                    about particularly were what we called “street urchins,” These were gypsy kids
                    and groups of ten or fifteen or twenty of them would hit sometimes a westerner
                    and it would all happen very quickly. The people would be stripped of purse and
                    billfold and everything. One place where one felt particularly vulnerable were
                    these long “perihouts”, I think they were called, long passageways under these
                    big wide Moscow streets because when you got into those there was no way out.
                    You had the exit behind you and the exit way, way in front of you and in between
                    you were in the middle of this long tunnel so there you were kind of vulnerable.
                    I know some people who got hit by the street urchins and got roughed up a little
                    bit and had their valuables stolen. There were a couple of occasions when I
                    thought they were kind of looking to me and I would walk next to a wall. I had
                    one of these umbrellas where you pushed the button and the umbrella thing comes
                    out and I remember a couple of occasions when I thought they were kind of
                    scouting me up and I pushed the button and my umbrella would come out and it
                    would look a lot like a club. So yeah there were these instances with petty
                    crime.</p>
                <p>Also not only the purse snatching but the mafia types were around. Once there was
                    an explosion at a little kiosk not far from the embassy. The word was that they
                    had not paid protection money and had been taken care of. While I was there we
                    did have an attack on the embassy. The RPG (rocket propelled grenade) was fired
                    against the side of the embassy and made a hole about a foot and a half across,
                    something like that in the facade of the embassy building. The round went
                    through and hit a Xerox copying machine on the other side or a safe. Anyway that
                    kind of absorbed the shock so people in the room were not injured. I was talking
                    on the phone at the time and I remember hearing this 'whomp' and I thought this
                    is not ordinary. I quickly wrapped up the phone conversation and then did
                    exactly the wrong thing, went to the window to look out.</p>

                <p>RUEDY: No, no I don't recall a single instance where I was harassed by the

                    feeling of being watched that I experienced in East Berlin all over the place I
                    did not have in Russia at the time. Some of the old Soviet types remembered that
                    that was the case always in the old Soviet Union, that you were always watched,
                    that you were always followed, there was always someone there. I just didn't
                    have that feeling.</p>

                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>RUEDY: He did on the very high upper level; he was not somebody who was aware of
                    me or what I was doing or anything like that. But they had established here in
                    Washington a separate, I forget the exact timing of all of that, but the
                    separate office that was responsible directly to the Secretary of State for
                    Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS) and that functioned de facto as a
                    geographic bureau. I think they were involved early on in the Freedom Support
                    Act in getting money for the kinds of things that we were doing in Russia. So,
                    on the macro level, yeah, we did have one or was it two presidential visits
                    while I was there as well. So it was a good deal of excitement in that regard
                    also. But no I got involved more in that later on, by that time Talbott was
                    deputy secretary. When I came back to Washington after my Moscow assignment,
                    first of all I did a year at the senior seminar at FSI (Foreign Service
                    Institute) which was tremendous and then I went into the rapidly imploding USIA
                    and was involved there in East European and NIS affairs. Then we reorganized the
                    office and split it up getting ready to merge into the State Department. In
                    their structure they had a de facto bureau for NIS affairs which was headed by
                    Steve Sestanovich. This had been opened I think by Strobe Talbott and then
                    Sestanovich inherited it when Talbott went to be deputy secretary.</p>
                <p>But in Moscow our programs certainly benefited tremendously from the interest and
                    the funding support that we were getting from the Washington side. That was
                    really emphasizing engagement with Russia and the countries of the former Soviet
                    Union at a time when, as I say, USIA was basically imploding. People were doing
                    the best they could and these were sharp, smart, very professional people but
                    they just didn't have the funding to do things with the Fulbright program for
                    example, the international visitors program like we should have been doing in
                    Russia or the American corner or anything else. Basically we were scratching
                    wherever we could and most of that seemed to be from the Freedom Support Act
                    funding which at the time initially came through AID. We had a good relationship
                    there with AID people. I think the relationship that we had with AID and USIS in
                    Moscow was closer, better than the relationship that exists I think in other
                    countries where AID is active and just from anecdotal stories that I've heard
                    from USIS colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that your office was playing any sort of a
                        consulting or supporting role for the Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan
                        and the various Stans and the Baltic states?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Not really, no. I think these were separate countries, separate
                    independent countries and I think we honored that in the abstract and in the
                    concrete. They had separate embassies and separate PAOs and separate operations
                    that were being supported by the same NGOs and things like that that were
                    supporting us. Ours was a country program and we knew of colleagues working in
                    Ukraine and working in Kazakhstan and the Baltics and the other places but our
                    program was for Russia. We really didn't get into acting as a central control or
                    something like that for programs that were going on in other NIS countries. They
                    reported separately to Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did the fighting in Chechnya play any role in or was
                        it a problem, what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was certainly there and festering and we didn't do anything. In fact,
                    we were wanting to do more in the Caucasus but it was too dangerous, too tough.
                    We did have a few exchange participants elsewhere in the region but yeah the
                    fighting was going on. The first Chechnyan war, there was still a OSCU
                    representation in Chechnya that was trying to do some stuff but no that was a
                    difficult period that was just beginning. We didn't in Moscow feel a threat of
                    Chechnyan terrorism or anything like that. It hadn't started, but certainly we
                    were aware of the war and the difficulties that the Russian government was
                    having in Chechnya. At the time I think there was also a feeling that if
                    Chechnya gained autonomy, too much autonomy then there might be other regions of
                    Russia that would be interested in breaking away as well or looking for more
                    autonomy. There was I think concern about whether the center will hold or
                    whether the Russian Federation was subject to further breakup. There was a
                    tentativeness about the Russian Federation generally and the component
                    parts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything in the USIA point of view over disputed
                        territories for the Ukraine particularly around Sebastopol and that
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, not really. I think there the party line, the official government line
                    was that the two parties just didn't work, didn't agree, but it didn't as I
                    recall produce any tension or impact on politics, flurries of back papers and
                    official texts and stuff like that for information section, press section, it
                    just didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't find yourself with any program that sort of
                        inadvertently finds itself in the middle of any dispute or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No, I don't recall that, I don't recall any problem like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then after, gee whiz I think it was a very
                        interesting time for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was and in retrospect I'm almost sorry that we didn't try to stay for a
                    third year. One had to declare pretty early on in the two years to extend for a
                    third year. It seemed to fit with our children's school schedule as well because
                    our daughter graduated from high school at the Anglo-American school in Moscow
                    and she was off to college when we came back to the States. Our son who is three
                    years younger we felt he would be able to do three years in an American high
                    school in Fairfax County so it would be logical for their schooling to break in
                    two years rather than for a third year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you came back and went to the senior seminar for
                        a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: It was a tremendously enriching year and the focus was on the United
                    States. We spent probably at least a week, ten days of every month, on the road.
                    We spent time in Army bases, Navy installations, Camp Pendleton and Air Force
                    bases, the Mississippi delta and farms in Indiana and Chicago and New York and
                    it was just a tremendously enriching year. Lots of conversations with lots and
                    lots of different people. It was just good training. The senior seminar has
                    since been abolished and I'm sorry to hear that because I found it tremendously
                    enriching. I think it is pretty cost intensive too I suppose to afford to send
                    somebody to a full year of training like that in terms of what you get out of it
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you did get out of it is a feel for the country. Its
                        not just because we are overseas operating but I think a government worker
                        who spends all his or her time in Washington develops an inside the beltway
                        mentality and doesn't really get a feel for what the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Absolutely. I think for us too it was sort of a matter of outreach also. I
                    think we were doing some good in talking to state officials, city officials and
                    stuff like that because overall I think we were a pretty impressive group. No
                    personal credit here but we were a bunch of sharp people in that group of 35. I
                    think meeting with media officials at CNN or various speakers that we had here
                    at FSI or whatever, they would, I think, come away impressed with the
                    conversations. David Broder from the Washington Post sort of split up the stuff
                    and called people and so on. They called up Broder and asked him if he would be
                    interested in coming to speak with the senior seminar and Broder said, “Yes, of
                    course, he would like to do that.” In fact I think he tried to make a point of
                    doing that when he got an invitation to State and he was really terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I went from there to a rapidly imploding USIA. I was assigned first as a
                    policy officer. It was hard getting a position as there weren't very many
                    openings and my specialty area obviously was European and NIS affairs. So, I
                    went as policy officer, third position in the office of East Europe and the
                    Newly Independent States. There I worked for a couple of people who I had worked
                    for over the years — Bob McCarthy who was the office director and Paul Smith who
                    had been the PAO in Moscow when I was there, deputy office director, so I was
                    working for the two of them. Bob McCarthy was another guy who really knows the
                    Balkans and Serbo-Croatian and absolutely fluent Russian. They were good guys to
                    work with, good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1998 to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: When was consolidation? I think consolidation was '99? Anyway the big
                    policy issue that was going on was the Balkan war. We were responsible for East
                    Europe and the Balkans as well as the countries of the former Soviet Union. So,
                    we were working on public affairs issues supporting our PAOs and our people in
                    the field in Macedonia and in Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kosovo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Kosovo was going down and I remember our PAO a really sharp guy in
                    Macedonia was traveling around with Chris Hill and was really trying to do
                    something in Kosovo before the bombing started. Philip Reeker was his name.
                    Later on he became the deputy spokesman at the State Department under Boucher
                    and is out in Budapest now as the DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission); he is a really
                    sharp officer.</p>
                <p>But anyway we were just working with them and providing policy support. We had a
                    small office actually in Pristina and a kind of a reading room, library and for
                    a while before the situation really went down the tubes we were trying to expand
                    that. It was to become a little platform for U.S. diplomatic presence in
                    Pristina so we would have more people on the ground there. I remember working
                    with the State Department to try to make that happen. Of course, it all got
                    overtaken by events but they were going to establish a consular presence in
                    Pristina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling towards that whole Kosovo situation?
                        I mean within your range there, was it sort of getting nastier and nastier?
                        Was it your feeling that it was going to kind of blow up and you would have
                        to do something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>RUEDY: Nobody quite knew what direction it was going to take. The feeling was
                    that Serbia was just taking it too far and what was going on in Kosovo could not
                    be allowed to stand. So we had the bombing campaign and all the rest of it. I
                    frankly was surprised when the bombing campaign was successful and I thought
                    that it was going to require some kind of ground presence or something else had
                    to happen. But finally it worked and a settlement came out of it. The flurry of
                    activity of just providing policy texts and the back and forth and the normal
                    ebb and flow of working with the post and thinking yeah we obviously had to
                    evacuate the PAO from Belgrade and I think they went overland up into Hungary.
                    There was lots and lots going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Then the USIA consolidation became our big issue and I was involved in
                    that stuff until I retired. I would have to look at the time table now to find
                    out exactly when the legislation went through that USIA would be consolidated
                    into the State Department and could no longer be a separate, independent agency.
                    The whole political history of that is pretty turgid, I mean all kinds of
                    justifications after the fact were made as to why this would be a good idea, but
                    there was also I think a good deal of political deal making between Madelyn
                    Albright and Jesse Helms. USIA's leadership was very, very weak and I think Joe
                    Duffy didn't see that as a bad thing. They definitely didn't fight it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joe Duffy, I mean people say either he wasn't effective or
                        really didn't like the job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: He wasn't interested, he didn't travel very much and he just wasn't
                    engaged very much. He just wasn't engaged very much in doing what a USIA
                    director needs to do. He wasn't really leading the agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a friend of Bill Clinton's I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I think so and especially his wife was a high-level Washington lobbyist
                    type. There was great hope in USIA when he was named because here he was an
                    academic and he would be somebody who understood exchange, international
                    education and stuff like that, but he just didn't amount to much. We were
                    savaged I think, not on the Hill so much. I think there were people on the Hill
                    that liked USIA that wished there was more robust leadership in USIA. I remember
                    reading a transcript of Duffy's appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations
                    committee and Joe Biden really savaging him; Biden was a Democrat and did wish
                    us well. He got lots of help from people like Biden, Bradley and many, many
                    others and more money generally, modestly more money than the administration or
                    Duffy was willing to ask for. I think there was some deal making that had to do
                    with a lot of people on chemical weapons, treaties or whatever. Of course, Jesse
                    Helms was out to get AID and I think the knives were really out for AID. AID did
                    have strong leadership and I think we were kind of collateral damage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A designated whipping boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Exactly, exactly. We were pretty low on the shelf in terms of Washington
                    priorities, Washington budgets or whatever not really very prominent so we got
                    consolidated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But one of the things that has struck me as I've done
                        these interviews now for close to twenty years has been the importance of
                        the USIA function overseas. In talking to people of their experiences in
                        many ways it is a richer experience than a significant number of the regular
                        Foreign Service officers, more getting out, more of an administrative
                        experience and all of that. Sometimes I think exchange programs are probably
                        one of the principal ways to further American interests in the field. I
                        think our foreign policy needs their programs a lot which unfortunately is
                        not happening as much. When a USIS officer returned to Washington they ended
                        up as sort of a minor figure, juggling, you know, not really having much to
                        do with anything outside of administrating money and people. I mean there
                        wasn't much policy impact from them back in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUDY: I think generally that is true, I wouldn't disagree with that. The
                    emphasis was on the field and everybody, sort of the mantra in USIA, knew that
                    the key stuff was happening out at the posts and the way you got promoted was
                    doing things overseas. I think in general USIA officers probably spent more of
                    their career overseas than many State Department officers did.</p>
                <p>In Washington, well when I was German desk officer, for example, I would try to
                    keep in close contact with my colleagues at State, EUR/CE, and get over to their
                    staff meetings and be in contact with them for one thing or another. But
                    certainly we weren't involved in “policy” whatever that means. We were involved
                    in supporting our programs on the ground that were taking place overseas. So
                    yeah the focus was much more on what was happening abroad. There was much
                    discussion about not having a domestic constituency.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>There was also the Smith-Mundt prohibition in law that prohibited USIA from
                    distributing its material within the United States. So we were definitely
                    outward focused. In working overseas I always felt that my work was as rewarding
                    or more rewarding than the work of embassy colleagues at comparable levels. I
                    felt that I was just as much a political officer, as tuned into the political
                    stuff as my colleagues in the political section were, maybe not tuned into the
                    economic stuff as much as the econ people were but working closely with them and
                    working closely with other embassy sections. I always felt that as a junior
                    officer that it was more of a managerial level whatever that is but in USIS we
                    didn't get to work very, very closely with embassy colleagues.</p>
                <p>Some USIS people had opposite views and would get off into the cultural centers
                    and left off from the embassy figuring the less they saw the ambassador or DCM
                    the better off they were. I can sympathize with that, but not much frankly; I
                    think when that happened we weren't as effective as we could have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: I retired in 2001. My last job was a challenge. I think in retrospect we
                    did all right with it but we need to reorganize our office. We were East Europe
                    and NIS affairs so we needed to split our office into an East European section
                    which got melded in to the West European section which joined EUR at the
                    Department of State. I became office director for public diplomacy for the NIS.
                    We then were melded into NIS affairs at the State Department. At the time it was
                    rather a hot structure rather than a de fact geographical bureau functioning as
                    a de facto geographical bureau under Steve Sestanovich. But, Sestanovich had the
                    title of special advisor to the secretary for the former Soviet Union, etc. So
                    anyway I and a group of three desk officers, a desk officer for Russia, a desk
                    officer for Central Asia and a desk officer for the Caucasus came over to the
                    State Department. We worked in a new office, found office space, figured out a
                    way to go with EUR/EX and all that stuff and then moved on over to the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>Overall I think it worked. It was difficult for people to kind of wrap their
                    minds around the idea that USIA was history and we were being merged into the
                    State Department but here we were in big Foggy Bottom and do it their way and do
                    it according to their rules, according to their procedure and there was no point
                    in saying, “Ah, but we did it better over at USIA.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean what hasn't, I don't know, I have a gut feeling
                        that by cutting up an agency you have hurt a very productive career path and
                        people who would act for the embassy but since policy wise as opposed to
                        allowing the public diplomacy people to come up on the backs of them, I
                        don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>RUEDY: I think that's true. I think there are some real problems with the
                    organizational structure now. Organizational charts don't tell you very much a
                    lot of times but if you look at public diplomacy in the State Department
                    organizational chart you see some interesting anomalies. The public affairs
                    officers out in the field report to their ambassadors and the DCMs. The public
                    diplomacy office in the geographic bureau is an office which reports in turn to
                    a deputy assistant secretary, who reports to an assistant secretary for
                    geographic affairs who reports to the undersecretary for political affairs who
                    reports in turn to the deputy secretary of state. On the public diplomacy side
                    the information bureau and the bureau of educational cultural affairs in turn
                    report on up the line to the undersecretary for public diplomacy who in turn
                    reports to the deputy secretary of state. So the two lines, the
                    educational/cultural affairs, the information program line doesn't come together
                    but the public diplomacy field operation line until you get up to the deputy
                    secretary of state level and what kind of stovepipe is that. So anyway Karen
                    Hughes will have an interesting job before her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's the designate to take over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really the whole thing hasn't really been settled yet, I
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: No and there's been revolving leadership in the public diplomacy
                    undersecretariat. They've had some sharp people. Ellen Lieberman was the first
                    undersecretary for public diplomacy and she was certainly bright and energetic
                    and had good intentions but you know the administration faded out. Charlotte
                    Beers, the ad executive, from Madison Avenue was named by Colin Powell and that
                    was sort of an inspired choice I suppose. But she really didn't, I don't think,
                    she had trouble getting her arms around the whole bureaucratic structure and how
                    to do things and how you make things happen, it must have been very frustrating
                    for her. She didn't last all that long in the job so we haven't really had
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>It's been an issue in public diplomacy. Even at USIA I think we had some people
                    who were politically well connected and that helped a lot, people like Wick but
                    you didn't have any director of USIA who was on the one hand good
                    administrators, steward of the agency, a leader of the agency and at the same
                    time somebody that had some clout and wisdom in the NSC and with the secretary
                    of state and policy circles in Washington, so that was always difficult. We
                    needed a friend of the president or something like that. Henry Catto was really
                    good, he had been ambassador in London. Bush I brought him back to sort out
                    things in USIA after things got kind of messy. Catto took hold, but he was in
                    for only about a year. Other than that, no, the leadership was kind of weak. It
                    was a problem for USIA through the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were facing a lengthy problem. Today the prestige
                        of the United States has been hurt very badly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUEDY: Well the Declaration of Independence says something about a decent respect
                    for the opinions of mankind, laying out a rationale for basic American policy
                    stuff including declaring ourselves independent and there is a long tradition of
                    that. I think we need to put our point across honestly and forcefully. Some
                    people are going to agree and a lot of people are going to disagree but you put
                    it across. Then I think bringing to bear the American society just sort of the
                    dynamism and I think the basic good will and decency of the American public I
                    think in finding a way to project that is important. The character of American
                    society is our most important public diplomacy asset.</p>
                <p>I remember in East Berlin talking to a few people. They were difficult to get to,
                    but the GDR would bring in students and others from third world countries
                    especially and provide them with first class education and they were supposed to
                    go out and be good Marxists and be the vanguard. But these people generally
                    didn't like East Germany all that much and found it a pretty dreadful,
                    repressive place and they were fighting an uphill battle. Then I remember
                    exchangees coming to the United States having almost always an overwhelmingly
                    positive experience and spending time here whether its two years getting a
                    masters degree or whether its three weeks on some kind of an international
                    visitors program going back with a great respect. Of course, when you talk to
                    them, eh, I think they would even tell you the bad news in some cases. But when
                    you talk to them they were just really enthusiastic and glowing about the
                    experiences that they had and the people that they had talked to and diversity
                    of opinion and the dynamism of the country and the activity that was going on
                    here. Some of it they would agree with and some of it they would reject. They
                    would say, “Well I'm too European, I'm too German to go along with this, that or
                    the other”, but they would have just a tremendous admiration for it. I talked
                    earlier about the Pershing II debate and the peace party when I was in Germany
                    and I think how big an asset in bringing about that very important step wasn't
                    so much intellectually convincing arguments as to why Pershing II got to be
                    stationed in Germany as opposed to the SS20s and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
                    and argue this point all day long. But I think it was basically a feeling that
                    the Americans for all of the back and forth sometimes and the confusion and
                    stuff like that we are just a country that was worth sticking with, that was
                    worth supporting. They felt a commonality, they felt a set of deeply shared
                    values and a friendship, a friendship they felt was worth it and commitment of
                    overcoming whatever the immediate policy issues were. Having a friendship; not
                    with this administration necessarily or an acceptance of this policy but a
                    relationship with this great country. As I say when you bring the dynamism of
                    the American public into the foreign policy process and I think we do that with
                    exchanges, it just works almost every time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well I think this is a good place to say “Auf
                        Wiedersehen” (German for good bye). “Dobre Diem” (Russian for Good
