                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 8th, 2002. This is an interview with Keith
                        Wauchope. This is done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies
                        and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Keith, let's start kind of at
                        the beginning. Could you tell me when and where you were born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I was born at Manhattan Hospital in New York City on October 13, 1941.
                    My parents actually lived out on the south shore of Long Island at the time</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, tell me a bit about, first of all on your father's
                        side, sort of where the family came from and your father's education and
                        what he was doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Okay, well, my father's father came to the United States in the early
                    1880s. He was a young man in County Cavan, Ireland and was sent by his father
                    down to Trinity College Dublin to study for the ministry, the Presbyterian
                    ministry. He and his older brother Jack, who was also studying at Trinity,
                    decided they didn't want to become ministers, so they quite literally ran away
                    to sea. He and his brother first went off to Australia and this trade between
                    the UK, between England and Australia. After several voyages in the 1870s my
                    grandfather jumped ship and joined the Australian army. I was told and that he
                    stayed in Australia for only about six months or so, and then deserted the army
                    and signed onto another ship to Peru. He joined the Peruvian navy and stayed
                    with them for a while. He earned a naval rating, and then he deserted the
                    Peruvian navy and caught a ship to San Francisco. He came ashore in San
                    Francisco and joined the U.S. Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About when was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He would have come to the United States in the early 1880s, I guess.
                    Having joined the United States navy, he became very intrigued with American
                    democracy and political issues. He ended up being the librarian at the Brooklyn
                    Navy Yard. Since he never had a college education, he started to educate himself
                    through reading the books in the library. He became persuaded that socialism was
                    the most rational system, so he became a socialist. When he got out of the navy
                    he joined the American Socialist Party and he became a journalist for the
                    socialist party, eventually the editor of the New York Call. Prior to that, he
                    worked for socialist publications in Chicago, Erie, Pennsylvania and eventually
                    in New York. The New York Call was an influential socialist newspaper in New
                    York and because of his stature as the editor and because of his oratorical
                    skills; in 1910 the socialists made him their candidate for mayor of New York on
                    the socialist ticket. I believe that it was at that time he changed his name to
                    Wanhope, W-A-N-H-O-P-E so as to be easier to pronounce for his supporters. In
                    1912 he was the socialist candidate for governor of New York. He was soundly
                    defeated both times, needless to say. Then in 1917 when the United States
                    entered World War I, Eugene Debs, the leader of the American Socialist Party
                    denounced the war as a creature of the “malefactors of great wealth” and called
                    upon all socialists to refuse to participate. My grandfather said that this
                    position was wrong. He believed that if the Socialist Party worked against the
                    United States participation in the First World War, that the party would in fact
                    be destroyed because the war was a popular cause. As a result, my grandfather
                    was run out of the party. Eugene Debs went to prison and my grandfather lost his
                    job as editor, and, unable to find other jobs in journalism, he went back to
                    sea. I guess he remained at sea until the late '20s or early '30s when he
                    finally was able to retire.</p>
                <p>As my father's family never had much money since my grandfather never made more
                    than $25 per week as a newspaper editor, my father ended up going to the New
                    York School Ship, which was the merchant marine academy for the State of New
                    York at that time. It was a two-year course and he received a certificate to sit
                    for the third mate's exam. You had to be 21 to get your certificate as a third
                    mate, which he eventually did. In any event he went on and became a second mate,
                    first mate and in seven years he made a captain. He was a captain for seven
                    years aboard the Farrell Lines ships - well, it was then the American South
                    African Lines - and then it later became the Farrell Lines. Its principal
                    business was with Africa, southern Africa. My father came ashore and married in
                    1935. He was made the port captain for the company. He met my mother when he was
                    Captain of the S.S. City of New York, a small passenger liner. He had the chief
                    steward make sure that all the attractive, single ladies aboard this flagship
                    vessel were seated at the captain's table and hence he met my mother. We'll talk
                    a little bit about her later.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>When the U.S. joined the Second World War, he was called to active duty despite
                    being the father of three children. He had a naval reserve commission as a
                    result of his training at the merchant marine academy. He was brought in as a
                    lieutenant commander and then promoted to commander and captain. He was made the
                    commanding officer of Sheepshead Bay Naval Training Facility in Brooklyn, New
                    York. He worked in that position for about 18 months. He ran afoul of the
                    left-leaning, in some cases communist, labor unions. At their request he was
                    removed, but as he had always wanted a sea command. He commanded an attack
                    transport in the Pacific for a period of about two and a half years and
                    participated in 21 amphibious operations. After VJ Day, he returned to the
                    United States where he rejoined the Farrell Lines. He had opened up its east
                    African trade just before the war, and after the war he was sent out to open its
                    West African trade. He was made the executive vice president and eventually in
                    the 1960s, the president of the company. It was that African connection that got
                    me interested in that region of the world because in 1959 and again in 1960 I
                    took cruises as a deck cadet aboard the Farrell Line ships. The first voyage was
                    to South Africa and the second to West Africa, and I think that sort of gave me
                    a flavor of that part of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. Well, she was from Baltimore by origin and her father was an Irish
                    immigrant as well. In point of fact, both of my grandfathers were born in
                    Ireland, one in Northern Ireland, in County Cavan and the other one in Mayo. Her
                    father had come to the United States to be a seminary student, but then chose
                    not to pursue the seminary. He ended up, as far as I understand it, a traveling
                    book salesman. My mother's mother was quite young, a good deal younger than he
                    was and my mother remembers him being gone quite a bit of the time. Nonetheless,
                    she was brought up by her mother in Baltimore. Then when she was about 20 years
                    of age she decided to go to New York. She had already been working by that time
                    for a shipping company; she completed high school, but didn't go to college. In
                    New York she worked as various jobs as a secretary or executive assistant in
                    shipping and later in advertising. She had some interesting experiences in that
                    process. While working for a temporary agency, she worked for Lowell Thomas one
                    evening recording in short hand his interview with Jimmy Doolittle over dinner.
                    Through this agency she ended up working for Osa and Martin Johnson who were
                    called explorers, but were entrepreneurs in filming exotic places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, hell's a popping. Wonderful comedians. I saw them
                        in New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. Oh, you're thinking of Olsen and Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no, no. This is Osa and Martin Johnson. Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Osa and Martin Johnson. Right. They made adventure movies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Flying those amphibian planes and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's right. Exactly. They flew some of the very first amphibians and
                    they flew them over to Africa. In 1933 I believe it was my mother was now their
                    full time secretary back in their apartment in New York while they had a place
                    just outside of Nairobi, which was their base of operations in East Africa,
                    their aircraft flew out of that area as well. My mother was doing their income
                    tax, very few people had to pay income tax at that time, but they made enough
                    money from their movies and lecture tours and books that they did in fact have
                    to pay. My mother sent them a telegram saying it was awfully difficult to do
                    their taxes without being able to talk to them about their expenses. Their
                    records were apparently in something of a shambles. So, they said, “Well, why
                    don't you come out?” By return telegram they said “a ticket is being arranged
                    for you. It's at such and such a location”. So, she went out on the S.S. City of
                    New York, which was a ship that my father was the captain of. She met my father
                    and there must have been an attraction. She spent a year in Nairobi from 1933 to
                    '34, and then returned to New York aboard the same ship accompanied by a cheetah
                    and several other animals the Johnsons were sending to zoos in the U.S. Some
                    time shortly thereafter my father and mother married and settled in an apartment
                    in New York. So, they both had their own exposure to Africa in one form or
                    another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in an era when this was just really very
                        exotic. I can remember seeing the Martin Johnson films?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, Martin and Osa Johnson. He was the photographer and she was the
                    hunter. She was the one that used to shoot the specimens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes and seeing these movies and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Congorilla was one of them. She wrote a book called I Married Adventure
                    that won the National Book Award in 1941. He was killed in a commercial air
                    crash in 1938, I think it was. They were both in the plane, but he was killed
                    and she was severely injured but survived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you an only child or did they have other
                        children?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, I had an older brother and was my sister and myself. My brother was
                    born in '36, my sister in '38 and I was in '41. We grew up in Long Island as I
                    say, my father went to Sheepshead Bay and we moved to the base from our home we
                    just bought on Long Island to live at Sheepshead Bay. When my dad went to sea in
                    the Pacific the family returned to our home in Lloyd Harbor, just north of
                    Huntington, New York on the north shoe of the island. We lived right next door
                    to the elementary school; we went to that school. Then in my own case I went to
                    military school, Stanton Military Academy, for a year and I didn't like it. So,
                    I then went on to the Boston Latin School in Boston, which is a public school,
                    and from there I went to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about early education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a small child or young child, what in elementary
                        school, any subjects kind of appeal to you particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: History in particular. History and geography were particularly
                    appealing to me. Something I should have said again in the connection with my
                    father and the Farrell Lines. In April of 1949 my father called my mother from
                    the office and said, “We have some ships being chartered by the American
                    Hawaiian Lines and they're going to be going around the world. Would you like to
                    take the kids on a trip around the world?” My brother was 12, my sister was 10
                    and I was seven and my mother jumped at the chance and said fine. He said,
                    “Well, you missed the sailing from New York through the Panama Canal, but you're
                    going to go across country by train and meet the ship, the African Planet, in
                    San Francisco.” The ship sailed from there to Tokyo, to Vietnam, to Hanoi and
                    then up the river to Saigon and then on to a port for Bangkok, Thailand and then
                    from there the ship reverted to control of the Farrell Lines and went along the
                    East African coast and down to Capetown. We went into the interior of Africa in
                    Mozambique, Rhodesia and South Africa and rejoined the ship again in Cape Town.
                    So, at age seven, I had some practical exposure to the world, the greater world
                    at that time.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was in the period immediately after the war, so that you saw the
                    desolation and economic ruin. My mother had a sister and her husband living in
                    Tokyo. He was with the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission doing studies on the
                    effects of the A-bomb. He had learned Japanese, and he had a MD and a PhD in
                    chemistry. So, we saw the Japanese economy in ruins; there almost no civilian
                    vehicles and every main street had old GI canvas tents along the curbs with
                    people selling all manner of junk like friction cars made out of painted beers
                    cans. I was also impressed going up the Saigon River by all the French and
                    Japanese vessels that had been sunk by both sides. In most cases you could only
                    see the masts and smoke stakes. As a portent of things to come, we also had
                    three Foreign Legionnaires aboard with Bren guns to protect the ship from Viet
                    Minh guerillas who had fired on previous ships going up the river. This is about
                    as exciting as it can get for a seven-year old boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Saigon River.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: There you go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of at the dinner table, having everybody doing this,
                        was there a lot of talk about the world and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Oh, absolutely. My dad made a point, even though he came home until
                    almost 8:00 from commuting from New York, of all sitting down to dinner with the
                    family together. So, in conversations around the dinner table, my father would
                    talk about what was going on in his company and events in the world, and try to
                    draw us in the conversation. He signaled that he valued our opinions and
                    expected us to be aware of what was going on in the world. It was a very
                    stimulating sort of thing I found.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, this was before the days of television, which of course was a
                    great watershed event in kids' education, or lack thereof. We had both an old
                    version of Britannica and the World Book Encyclopedia. I spent a great deal of
                    time I remember as a kid reading the encyclopedia and reading a lot of the
                    history there. I remember that for each country it had sort of a text and
                    picture outline of the major historic events, and so I remember going through
                    all that. I knew about the Sino-Japanese War in 1895 all from reading those
                    books. I read a fair amount and I read mostly nonfiction primarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when you, any books that may stick in mind,
                        particularly in your earlier years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I read a great deal about the Civil War. Even to this day is a
                    matter of great interest to me. I don't know that I can cite any particular
                    book, but I did a lot of reading on the Civil War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The books by, I want to say, Stillness at Appomattox.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right, I read all the Bruce Catton books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bruce Catton books.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's right, Glory Road, Mr. Lincoln's Army. That's right. Yes, I read
                    all of Bruce Catton's books. They were very readable books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were the first readable books that came out after the
                        war. The Douglas Freeman books were a little heavy going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Heavy going, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I got those in high schools, but wow.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Lee's Lieutenants and all that, yes, that's true. These were much
                    easier to go through and at that point my brother had gone to military school,
                    the Stanton Military Academy. We used to drive through Virginia on visits to see
                    him. We used to stop and see the battlefields. My mother would take the time to
                    try to give us the chance to see the battlefields. We knew something about the
                    Civil War, so we could talk about it. My brother was always very interested in
                    the military. He attended VMI for almost two years, and then he didn't like it.
                    He literally walked away from it. He joined the Marines as a recruit and did a
                    six month enlistment. He later was able to qualify for a competitive appointment
                    to West Point. He graduated in 1962. Having been in the Marine Corps as a
                    recruit at Parris Island, and having joined the Virginia National Guard at 17 �,
                    the military was his life. Because of his prior service in the Marines, he was
                    able to obtain a commission in the Marine Corps when he graduated from West
                    Point. He was always spoiling to get into combat, so when he was assigned to
                    Okinawa, he volunteered to go to Vietnam. He won the Bronze Star for an action
                    while he was TDY as an advisor to the Vietnamese rangers. When he returned to
                    Okinawa, his unit had been sent to Chu Lai on the coast of the northern part of
                    South Vietnam. He hadn't been there more than a month when he was killed in June
                    of 1965 along with four other Marines in his unit. He led his detail to secure
                    the rear area of the anvil position in a larger Marine sweep operation. His
                    troops came under sniper fire from VC hidden in tunnels, and he was killed
                    trying to steady his troops and return fire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: So, I mean he was doing what he wanted to do, but it was very sad and
                    ironic as he had refused to permit his troops to blow up the tunnels in which
                    the VC were hiding behind women and children who were visible at the mouth of
                    the tunnels. His death had a great impact on my family, needless to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you towards, was this the first year of
                        high school that you went to Staunton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was, yes. I guess I was very much influenced by brother. I think
                    there is little question about that. When we were kids we didn't play cowboys
                    and Indians. He was such a student of history that we used to play war taking
                    sides like the Russians against the Finns. This was remarkably obscure in
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The winter war.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's right, exactly. I always seemed to get stuck being a Russian,
                    which was not a particularly good thing to be at that time, needless to say. We
                    played some rather exotic historical sort of games, and we both had extensive
                    collections of lead soldiers when we were kids. That all had an impact on me,
                    and I wanted to follow in my brother's footsteps, but I very quickly realized
                    that the military was not the life for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I went to Boston Latin School after that. At Staunton, I had done quite
                    well academically, but I just didn't like the military regimen... So, I went up
                    to visit some of the various prep schools in New England. I didn't like those
                    very much, but the Boston Latin School, which is a public school, seemed to have
                    an appeal. My mother had a sister and her husband; the same ones that had been
                    living in Japan, now were living outside of Boston. She and my father were
                    separated at that point and so she said, “Well, look why don't I move up there
                    and you can go to the Boston Latin School?” After three years of struggle, I did
                    graduate from there. It was a much more rigorous school by far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Much more rigorous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's one of the oldest schools, but also it remains one of
                        the preeminent schools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. It was founded in 1635, one year before Harvard, and, as
                    they say, Harvard was founded because they needed a place to send the Latin
                    School graduates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Boston Latin, what subjects were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It's very heavy on languages. Of course, you take Latin all the years
                    you're there and it's a six-year school. It goes from the seventh grade to the
                    twelfth, and you must take Latin and you must take two other languages. So, I
                    took French and German, German in lieu of Greek. The other option was classical
                    Greek no less. Then you took mathematics every year, and some science. When
                    Sputnik was launched in 1957, the emphasis began to shift to scientific courses,
                    which at Latin School you usually took only in your senior year. You either took
                    physics or chemistry, and the school began to shift toward the sciences. I got
                    caught up in that and I was good in math in particular and I thought that I
                    wanted to go into engineering. At Latin School, I found the first few months of
                    the school especially tough. I wasn't sure I was going to survive there. The
                    Boston school system is set up in such a manner that there are neighborhood high
                    schools, and then there were six or so city-wide specialized schools. Latin is
                    considered the top, then there's English, Trade and Commerce. I don't know what
                    the others were. They drew from the entire Boston school district and the
                    requirements to get into Boston Latin School were and are very rigorous indeed.
                    At the seventh grade level, what was called the sixth forum, there were as many
                    as 750 kids. When I graduated in 1959, there were 278 in my class. This shows
                    the degree of attrition there was through the six-year process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the teachers that particularly
                        struck you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I remember the English teacher, Mr. Mark Russo, who was a
                    particularly demanding individual, was also my homeroom teacher one year. His
                    particular problem was that he was a graduate of English High School, which was
                    then right across the street from Boston Latin School. He kept taunting us by
                    saying, “You know, you're supposed to be the cream of the cream, and look at
                    you.” We used to have to do recitations and memorize from Shakespeare and the
                    poets. I remember committing to memory The Ancient Mariner. It was just part of
                    the rote process Boston Latin. There were eight marking periods a year as well.
                    Once every month your academic performance was recorded as well as you conduct,
                    tardiness and attendance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you got towards the end of this, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I was kind of torn at this stage. I didn't know what I wanted to
                    do. I applied to a variety of colleges and I thought I wanted to study
                    engineering, particularly mechanical engineering, and my father encouraged me in
                    that regard. I was accepted by Johns Hopkins and, of course, they have a great
                    engineering school. So, I thought that was certainly a tremendous opportunity.
                    I'll be happy to go there. I didn't know Baltimore very well, but that was
                    fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother was from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: She was by origin, and she had a sister who had lived there for some
                    years. I had seen the Hopkins campus when I visited my aunt, but by then this
                    aunt had moved elsewhere. So, it was kind of a new experience to me, but that's
                    part of the process. My parents had always told me that one of the best things
                    in life is that as you become older and more responsible, you do move out and
                    you go out on your own. You make your own life, as they had both done. My
                    father, whose father was a socialist, ironically became very much the
                    capitalist, and eventually ended up being the president of his maritime shipping
                    company. He rejected his father's ideology and he went off on his own. My mother
                    left Baltimore and went to New York to make her way in the world. So, they
                    instilled in us the idea that you are expected to launch on your own. It's one
                    of the great experiences of life. I thought, fine, this attitude sounds good to
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, you went to Johns Hopkins from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: '59 to '63, and after a year and a half of engineering it became
                    evident to me the mysteries of calculus, first differential, which I could
                    barely fathom, and then integral calculus, about which I didn't have a clue,
                    that I was not going to make it as an engineer if I couldn't handle the math.
                    So, I returned home at Thanksgiving vacation my sophomore year and I said to my
                    father, “This is not working. I'm not going to make it in engineering.” I said,
                    “Maybe I should go into the military for a couple of years or something like
                    that.” He was very adamantly opposed to that. He said, “Well, what would you
                    like to study?” I said, “History.” He said, “Well, that's fine, except what do
                    you do with history?” He was a very pragmatic individual. I said, “Well, I'm not
                    sure, but you asked me what I'd like to study and I've told you.” So, he said,
                    “Fair enough.” He had a friend who was a professor at the Hopkins graduate
                    school, Professor McKay. He said, “Well, have lunch with this guy and find out
                    from him what he thinks you could do with a history degree.” So, I did and McKay
                    said, “Well, it's limited, of course you could teach, you could research, you
                    could work for the history department of a U.S. government agency among other
                    options.” None of that sounds particularly appealing to me, but I wanted to
                    learn more about history. So, I returned to Hopkins, changed my classes around
                    and became a liberal arts major, a B.A. generalist candidate with what they
                    called a concentration in history. I took courses in Russian, German, and
                    English history and economics, political science, subjects I found very
                    intriguing. I did a great deal better at that because it was something that I
                    really enjoyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this '59 to '63 period, one of the things
                        that's, I won't say watershed, but it certainly stirred up the youth of
                        America was the arrival of President Kennedy on the scene. Did that hit both
                        the campus and you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, it did. I remember from my personal recollection the great impact
                    the 1962 Cuban missile crisis had on us. By this time my brother was an officer
                    in the Marine Corps. He was still in training even having graduated from West
                    Point. They required commissioned officers in the Marines to do another six
                    months of training and then advanced officers training. He was mobilized during
                    the crisis, and I didn't know where he was. He was with a unit that was supposed
                    to be in the reserve for the invasion of Cuba. I can remember the tense moments
                    when Kennedy spoke on television to the nation. We watched him at the Student
                    Rec Center in the dorms where there was one of the few televisions. In those
                    days, that was about the only place on campus where you could go to watch
                    television. When Kennedy spoke, I remember how silent the room became where
                    ordinarily it was chaos with the kids bellying up to get a sub sandwich or coke.
                    All of a sudden the students understood that this was serious, serious business.
                    We were all on the edge of our seats for quite some time over that crisis,
                    concerned as were most Americans about a possible nuclear exchange.</p>
                <p>I was involved in a related event regarding the U.S. embargo on Cuba. There was
                    to be a demonstration protesting the embargo in Washington. Madeleine O'Hare
                    Murray, the well-known atheist, lived in Baltimore, and she was organizing a
                    protest at the White House one Saturday morning. She wanted to rally the
                    Baltimore contingent at the Hopkins campus, and then head down to Washington
                    from there. There was a counter demonstration group, which felt that it was
                    inappropriate for her to muster her forces at the Hopkins campus. It wanted to
                    block the rally and disassociate Hopkins from the effort. I participated in the
                    counter demonstration. I was very supportive of the concept of using restrained
                    force in dealing with Cuba. There was a confrontation that lasted an hour or so.
                    Finally the police were invited onto the campus and Murray was escorted off. We
                    just wanted to make the point that she wouldn't represent Johns Hopkins in her
                    Washington demonstration.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The other great issue of the time, of course, was civil rights. Civil rights
                    demonstrations were ongoing, and some Hopkins students were involved in them. I
                    remember at the time I was surprised that in the entire university, which had
                    1200 undergraduates at that time, there were only six black students, and this
                    in a city that was predominantly black. There were demonstrations in Baltimore
                    and in Washington, and I had friends who participated. While I did not
                    participate, I was aware that the civil rights issue was obviously an issue of
                    great national importance. Orval Faubus was governor of Arkansas and his
                    resistance to integration was much discussed. I had no use for the racists, but
                    in retrospect, I was having too good a time in college to become seriously
                    involved. The Kennedy appeal for Americans to ask not what the country could do
                    for them, but what you could do for the country had a great impact on our
                    generation. When I was in Army ROTC, we were being instructed on
                    non-conventional warfare, which was the flavor of the month, if you will, in the
                    military at that time. We were studying Sun Tzu and Mao Zedong's writings such
                    as how the fish, the insurgent, swims in the friendly waters, the peasantry.
                    Counter insurgency was to figure out ways to counter Maoist doctrine, and
                    Vietnam and Laos were key areas in this conflict. In the summer of '62 Hopkins
                    ROTC juniors went to summer camp at Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania along with ROTC
                    from schools all over the eastern half of the United States. We did exercises in
                    ambush and patrolling, with the focus being on Southeast Asia. Again the idea
                    was that you had to answer the call to confront communism, which was making
                    inroads around the world, which was a threat to democracy and to our way of
                    life. We had an obligation to try to halt that and to understand what motivated
                    them. We rejected their philosophy, but had to try to understand their
                    methodology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you as you moved into history looking for something,
                        you know, what to do with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, but being in the ROTC, I knew that I had a two-year obligation in
                    the military. I was called; I love this terminology, an “obligated volunteer,”
                    so I knew what I would be doing for at least two years. I thought about what I
                    would do after that, but I really didn't have a great concern. I thought well,
                    maybe the military is the career for me; or maybe I could find something else.
                    The military school experience hadn't been a positive one, but at that rate,
                    maybe if we're broadening our perspective as the military seemed to be in their
                    view of global issues, maybe there is a place for me in that organization. I was
                    a distinguished military graduate in ROTC and as such, I was allowed to chose my
                    branch of the army, I chose army intelligence. I thought, well, who knows, this
                    might be the thing for me. So, I kept an open mind about it without any strong
                    sense of what I would do after the two years in the Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, in '63 you went right into the army.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I did. I graduated in June and I reported for duty in Fort Benning in
                    August. All the intelligence officers had to go through infantry officer basic
                    at Fort Benning. August was a hellish time of year to be down in Georgia. I was
                    commissioned upon graduation. I then took some time to see a bit of the country
                    before I headed to Georgia. I completed nine weeks at infantry officer school.
                    Then I was assigned to the Intelligence School at Fort Holabird, which is now a
                    minimum-security prison where John Dean spent six months for his part in
                    Watergate. I did the basic counterintelligence course there. During my training
                    there, John Kennedy was assassinated. We were all deeply shocked. I had friends
                    in Washington and went down on Saturday morning to witness the transfer of
                    Kennedy's casket from the White House to the Capitol to be on public display.
                    The scene was memorable; tens of thousands of spectators and yet absolute
                    silence. There was only the sound of the horses' hooves on the pavement as they
                    drew the caisson up Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
                <p>As my four-month counter-intelligence training was winding up, I had to explore
                    assignment opportunities. I could do a tour in Europe, but tours there are all a
                    full two years, which meant I would have to extend your obligation by a year.
                    There was Korea, which was a 13-month tour, and then there was Vietnam, which
                    was only a 12-month tour. Korea sounded like yesterday's news and Vietnam
                    sounded like where things were getting interesting. So, I asked to go to a
                    counter-intelligence unit in Vietnam. I was told there were no openings, at that
                    time. This was March of 1964 and so I said, well, okay, I'd wait for an opening.
                    They said there would be openings in October of '64, which was fine with me.
                    They had to find things for me to do until October. They sent me to some
                    advanced training. I took Vietnamese language training under the Berlitz method,
                    and I took some other courses, which I guess they still teach in the army. One
                    was called Defense Against Mechanical Entry, or DAME. Theoretically, it teaches
                    you basic physical security, but in reality it was about how to pick locks and
                    to surreptitiously break into a facility. All these things had to be done in
                    such a manner so that the other side wouldn't know you're stealing their
                    secrets. They used to show us how you could expand a doorframe and so, if there
                    was a sliding lock or a bolt, you could expand the frame to bypass the bolt, and
                    the enemy would never know you had gotten in. Theoretically it was our job to
                    figure out how to stop our enemies from doing these things to us. We learned how
                    to get a slide chain off a chain-looked door and slip in. One of the useful
                    things that I learned in the Army. I used to show my friends at Hopkins, about
                    the great things I learned in the Army. I also took an investigative photography
                    course that gave me a real interest in that medium. An opening in Vietnam did
                    come up in October and I was assigned to the 704th Intelligence Corps detachment
                    based just outside of Saigon in Gia Dinh Province. Our responsibility was as the
                    counterintelligence advisors to the Military Assistance Command in Vietnam or
                    MACV. I was the section chief of a unit that investigated terrorist acts and
                    tried to pick up intelligence information on terrorists and provide reporting on
                    it. We also did background investigations and followed leads on U.S. personnel.
                    I had a lot of exotic experiences in Vietnam.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd like to talk a little about this. Were you were
                        there when there were a couple of sensational attacks? There was one on the
                        floating restaurant and another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: The Mekong Restaurant bombing, yes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Actually the Mekong bombing occurred while I was on R&amp;R, but I was
                    there for the bombing of the Brinks Hotel which was just before Christmas in
                    1964. It occurred just before Bob Hope made his first visit to Vietnam with his
                    troupe. He made a joke about it. Something to the effect “I looked out the
                    window of my hotel and saw another hotel going by on fire.” We investigated the
                    scene of that bombing, and then I was there for the American Embassy bombing in
                    March of 1965. I actually made it to the scene when the building was still in
                    flames. I saw a fire truck pull up and run over the body of a women, some
                    hapless Vietnamese that had been killed on the sidewalk. The building next door
                    was on fire. I got my agents out and started collecting what information they
                    could. We knew the Embassy security people pretty well. I was just about to get
                    out of the car myself and somebody came supporting an Embassy official who had
                    been peppered with glass from head to toe and was bleeding all over the front of
                    his clothes. The escort said, “Here's an American. I'll put you in his car;
                    he'll take you to the hospital.” I thought, well this isn't really what I'm
                    supposed to do, but how can you not do it? I said, okay, fine, put him in. He
                    was bleeding pretty profusely, but nothing gushing at least. So, I headed out
                    into traffic. Of course, the explosion had caused all the traffic to be diverted
                    and I immediately got into a God awful traffic jam. I'm leaning on the horn and
                    making all kinds of crazy maneuvers, but the guy in the back was very calm. He
                    said, “That's all right. Take it easy. I'm okay; I'll make it to the hospital.”
                    So, he cooled me down a bit, and I eventually got to the hospital which was in
                    chaos as well. I got to the entranceway and the MPs were excited, but, if you're
                    an American you could come in. So, I said I've got this wounded guy. They
                    immediately took him and put him in the emergency and rolled him in and said,
                    “Now get out of here.” So, I got out and eventually made my way back and picked
                    up the information I needed. It was a horrible event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able, I mean, what was your impression of were we
                        sort of cleaning up after the terrorist attack or were we able to stop
                        things at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, that was the concept. If we could figure out how they did it, we
                    could try to prevent the VC from using the same technique again... A good
                    example was the Brinks Hotel bombing. The Viet Cong dressed up as a Vietnamese
                    army major and by virtue of his rank, he was able to intimidate the gate guards
                    to drive his vehicle in and park it underneath the building. He set the fuse and
                    then he slipped out. That's an obvious route that's had to be cut off. I mean
                    any Vietnamese officer has got to be checked, or you've got to replace all the
                    guards with Americans. So that was the concept, to prevent repetition, to find
                    out what actually did happen. The chaos after an event like that is staggering —
                    sorting out what really happened versus what people think they saw. I will have
                    to say about the Viet Cong, as much as I was personally committed to the U.S.
                    effort there, it was very evident that the VC were a dedicated and formidable
                    enemy. I talked an American advisor who had come up from the Fourth Corps, and I
                    remember this particular individual saying, “I wish I was advising the other
                    side.” The VC are really disciplined and professional. He said, the people I'm
                    working with go out on patrols with their transistor radios blaring, obviously
                    trying to chase off anybody that might be out there so they don't have to engage
                    in combat with them. He said the other side never makes the same mistake twice.
                    If we ever do catch them off guard, they almost instantaneously disseminate what
                    went wrong and make certain that they won't do it again. So that, for example,
                    they frequently would attack a fixed target, and the relief force would come
                    out, and the real object of the exercise was to ambush the relief force. The
                    South Vietnamese army fell for that over and over and over again. There was a
                    certain sense of futility, which led to U.S. troops saying that all we needed
                    was two American divisions and we could clear this insurgency up in no time. I
                    was skeptical about that because the issue, of course, was how do you tell the
                    good guys and from the bad guys. You never really knew. Our unit was assigned
                    specific cases to investigate, for example, outside the U.S. air force base in
                    Tan Son Nhut, a GI bought the equivalent of a hot dog outside the gate, and
                    found it was wrapped in a classified air force maintenance manual. Where did the
                    vendor get that? So, we checked it out, and some Vietnamese had found the manual
                    in the trash and had picked it up. Another time, after an operation took place
                    and U.S. troops found, among other captured documents, the carbon copies of a
                    computer printout of the complete staffing pattern of MACV, their grades , all
                    their data, the I.D. numbers and all of the rest of it. So, we had to try to
                    find out what happened in that instance. We came to learn that the VC had so
                    many stolen documents that their biggest problem was finding the time to analyze
                    it in real time; for real OB, order of battle, information. They were virtually
                    carting it away by the truckload largely because the South Vietnamese were
                    selling it to the VC, as host government had no serious document security.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Another mission of our unit, in which I participated to a limited degree, was the
                    recovery of American prisoners of war. At the time I joined the unit, I think
                    there were some 29 American who were believed to be alive and in the hands of
                    the Viet Cong. By the time I left the number was closer to 120. Our job was to
                    track them from intelligence information, and particularly from informants. The
                    Vietnamese quickly figured out that the informant business was a very lucrative.
                    They'd come up with all kinds of tales. They would tell us, they saw an American
                    at such and such a location and then we would ask them what the American looked
                    like and try to get them to provide a physical description. We knew what every
                    POW looked like, so we'd check it out. The intelligence peddling was such that
                    one time we had a fellow that came in and claimed to have a certain amount of
                    information. We quickly dismissed it as bogus because about three weeks later we
                    were told we were to go to downtown Saigon and set up a discrete defensive
                    perimeter around a downtown office building by driving our cars around it. We
                    were all to be armed with both our side arms and with weapons in the car because
                    OSI, the Air Force intel group, had an informant who was so valuable and so
                    knowledgeable that they didn't want anybody to come in and blow him away. OSI
                    had a safe house in an office and everything to debrief the guy, so we moved in
                    and out between mobile patrols. We traded off going inside the outer office and
                    then patrolling the corridor. In that process, we were sitting in the
                    antechamber and the door opened a crack and we looked in to see that the OSI
                    informant was the same guy we'd had dismissed three weeks earlier. The OSI
                    thought they had the real thing. There were an awful lot of different intel
                    groups tripping over each other in Saigon, as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I must say that the people giving this type of
                        information talk to people who were in Thailand 30 years later and people
                        peddling fake dog tags. I mean the whole thing is still going on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: There also was a hierarchy in the intel community in Saigon. We were
                    near bottom of the food chain in that regard because we were authorized to pay
                    only up to $10,000 for an informant. The CIA, by contrast, had the authority to
                    sign up to a million dollars for prisoner recovery. We knew some of the CIA
                    people and they were real cowboys, boots and all. I mean this mission was a high
                    priority, obviously. We did launch recovery operations while I was there, but we
                    had to use Vietnamese troops with U.S. advisors. These were supposed to be elite
                    troops. We had really solid information which we'd more or less confirmed with
                    overhead photography, but when they got there the Americans, of which there were
                    two had been moved out about 15 minutes before the Vietnamese troops arrived.
                    The advisers figured that, despite not telling tell the Vietnamese exactly where
                    they were going, somehow they got the word and they passed it to the Viet Cong
                    in time. They recovered 72 Vietnamese officers in this raid, but the Americans
                    were gone. Our focus was obviously on the Americans.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No. In the time I was there we never got one we could take credit for.
                    One escaped. He was Sgt. Camacho, a Special Forces sergeant, one tough
                    character. A member of my team went to Okinawa to debrief this guy because we
                    needed to find out what he could tell us about how they treated our prisoners
                    and where they were moved to. That was the only one that got out, but he got out
                    on his own. Several others died in captivity and we learned about that, and the
                    circumstances. Essentially American prisoners of war were badly mistreated and
                    exploited politically. The peace movement in the United States didn't want to
                    hear any of this. The Jane Fonda crowd was used as propaganda tools. The
                    prisoners were moved around constantly, with ropes around their necks and their
                    hands tied and they were moved from one village to another to show this is the
                    great imperialist captured and defeated. The VC mistreated them pretty severely.
                    I mean, it wasn't the repetitive torture and this nonsense in The Deer Hunter,
                    all that kind of stuff is overdone, but they were not treated viciously.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I think at that stage, and this again is October '64 to October
                    of '65 were still committed to the U.S. effort. The other significant event
                    during my time in Vietnam was the arrival of Americans combat units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is after the, what was it, the attack on the
                        airport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: At Ben Hoa Airport, exactly. I was there when Ben Hoa was hit and we
                    were all pretty stunned that they could pull that off. They later rocketed and
                    attacked the Da Nang Airport with satchel charges and had a remarkable degree of
                    success. Of course we also started to bomb after the Gulf of Tonkin in August of
                    '64, but then we shifted our aircraft to Da Nang which was a much more efficient
                    operation to do it from a fixed platform like an air base in the northern part
                    of South Vietnam. Then of course we needed to bring in the Hawk missiles to
                    protect it from potential retaliation by North Vietnamese air force, and then
                    you had to bring in the marines to protect the Hawk missile batteries. I was
                    there when the Marines came into I CORPS in the North and when the first
                    infantry division landed, when the Koreans came. We had picked up information
                    about a VC effort against the Koreans, which we found kind of amusing. The Viet
                    Cong heard that the Koreans were coming, and there was a fair amount of fanfare
                    about it and they were going to be debarking in Saigon. They were going to come
                    up the river in LSTs and be landed and there would be a parade and a ceremony.
                    The Viet Cong though it could quickly create a schism between the Vietnamese
                    people and the Koreans by having somebody dressed in a Korean uniform throw a
                    grenade into a bar or something like that, and everybody will know that it was
                    the Koreans who did it. When the VC saw the Koreans and these guys were squat
                    and muscular, they gave up the plan. The Koreans were select troops, and they
                    were tough.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. We didn't think they were going to find anyone that looked
                    like a Korean. So, they gave up on the idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Koreans, I mean nobody messed with the Koreans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, they didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean they kind of got to that place near Da Nang sort of
                        were rather static, but within their area nobody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: From the perspective of the Viet Cong, and later the North Vietnamese,
                    it simply wasn't worth taking on the Koreans and they were absolutely
                    no-nonsense. The U.S. operated with certain constraints in the way we fought the
                    war. The Koreans had no such constraints, and they said of themselves, we know
                    this enemy; we fought this enemy before at home. The VC are brutal people, and
                    we will be brutal as well. In their areas there was almost no activity because
                    they were tested early on. A Korean platoon was out beyond its perimeter on a
                    reconnaissance in force and a Viet Cong battalion attacked them. The Koreans
                    damn near destroyed the Viet Cong battalion and while the Koreans got mauled, by
                    comparison the casualties they inflicted were just unbelievable. We heard from
                    American advisors operating with Vietnamese troops about what the Korean areas
                    were like; the VC were terrified of them. Their hand-to-hand combat skills were
                    legend; the VC didn't stand a chance man-to-man against the Koreans. Because
                    they were select troops; there was an army division and a marine division. They
                    accepted only volunteers and they took them on the basis of their performance
                    record and their abilities, and they were paid extra, I think it was triple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They each came back with the equivalent to a large
                        container full of PX goods.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That was something of a scandal. . I thought, fine, if these guys were
                    willing to take it on all comers, let them have the privileges. There were up to
                    50,000 Koreans there and they were worth their weight in gold. While I was there
                    some other units came in, the Australians came in country while I was there.
                    They were a rowdy crowd, but relatively effective. The Australians said, well,
                    we've fought this war before in the Emergency in Malaysia, and we know all about
                    it. You have to be willing to wade up to your neck in the water along a footpath
                    used by the enemy for as long as three days, and then you could spring your
                    ambush. Well, the greatest success they had was down on the Vung Tau peninsula
                    which is at the mouth of the Saigon River. The Viet Cong were probing their
                    positions and a heavy rainstorm began. They were able to maneuver their APCs
                    behind the Viet Cong as they were moving on their position. The Viet Cong didn't
                    hear them because of the rain. The Australians mowed the VC down with heavy
                    machine guns. This was really the antithesis of what they said you had to do to
                    be successful. They quickly realized that it was going to be a long difficult
                    struggle as well. Their most fun was when they went into Saigon for a day's
                    R&amp;R. They were transported in by truck. They were told okay, you had all day
                    here and will be picked up at 6:00 in the afternoon to return to base before
                    dark. By 6:00 they were so drunk it was unbelievable. They seemed to feel that
                    they had a sort of a reputation to maintain. Many of the Aussies were so drunk
                    they had to be thrown up onto the truck. Many of them had been picked up by
                    their own MPs or ours, and been hauled back to the square and thrown up onto
                    their trucks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the American Embassy other
                        than picking up the wounded?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, we did. Louis Gaffney was the security officer, RSO, a real nice
                    guy and we used to see him on a periodic basis to talk about physical security
                    and to exchange information. We had document security case in which we were
                    investigating about the alleged leak of highly sensitive information and we were
                    called upon to interview all the U.S. officials with that clearance. We went to
                    the embassy building, the one that was later blown up. I met John Burke who was
                    a political officer there. I ended up working for John Burke years late in
                    ARA/CAR. We didn't have much contact with the political section per se, but
                    mostly with the security side. I took the Foreign Service exam at the embassy. I
                    had taken the Foreign Service exam in December while I was still in training at
                    Fort Holabird. I had a fraternity brother living in Washington who said he was
                    talking the Foreign Service exam and would I be interested in taking it. I said,
                    what's the Foreign Service exam. He said, well, you know, the people who staff
                    embassies and consulates. So I signed up on a lark and I took the exam in one of
                    these huge high schools in Northwest Washington. I didn't pass it, but I got a
                    65. They sent me a letter saying I was close enough that I ought to take it
                    again. So, I began to think maybe this was a good option, especially as my
                    stateside experience in the military reaffirmed to me that I didn't like the
                    military life. This business of saluting people, or being saluted; neither one
                    appealed to me. The whole regimented process and the hierarchy was unappealing.
                    It was a time when the military was so gung ho that criticism of such things
                    injustices or racism was not well received. I remember being in the officers'
                    club in Fort Holabird and a captain was drunk and obnoxious. There was an
                    enlisted man working as bartender. This captain was profane and abusive. A
                    friend of mine from Hopkins and our dates were there. This captain came over to
                    our table and he said offensive things to the girls. I thought to myself, you
                    know, this is what's wrong with this system. There's no way a person, just
                    because he's a captain, should be able to get away with this sort of nonsense.
                    So, I determined that I wouldn't stay in. When I got the notice saying that I
                    should take it again, I arranged to take the exam at the American Embassy in
                    Saigon. At that time the consular section was on the compound where they later
                    built the new embassy. It was on the other side of town from the old embassy. I
                    took the exam with perhaps 30 others, and this time I passed.</p>

                    low-lying buildings. One was consular and the other security...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were outside the security perimeter, you know. All the

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, well, that's kind of how it was. I guess they thought that they
                    wanted to have it apart because they had so many locals applying there. That
                    reminds me of Robert Apple, the correspondent, I guess he's still at the
                    Washington Post, married the vice consul there. That was another contact we
                    would occasionally have, we would deal with her on issues of military personnel
                    issues. GIs who had security clearances got into trouble with the law in Saigon,
                    and that would come to their attention. Her name was Smith I think, but she was
                    one tough lady. These characters would come in, these American GIs, and they'd
                    want to marry these bargirls that they had just met. In most cases, it was the
                    first time they'd ever had sex, and they were enchanted with the Vietnamese
                    women. They'd come in and she'd size up the situation right away because in many
                    instances she'd seen these women in there before. She'd ask the couple a few
                    questions and then she'd ask the girl to step outside. She'd close the door and
                    then she would read the kid the riot act. “I've seen this woman in there x
                    number of times. She's just another Goddamn prostitute.” Anyway, I admired her.
                    I thought she is one tough officer, a good sensible person. She was slightly
                    injured in the March 1963 bombing from glass fragments.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: A little bit. I'll tell you what, my father said after I took the exam

                    had a friend who was in the Foreign Service. In fact he knew several Foreign
                    Service people. Of course, being in the West African shipping business he knew
                    Alex Davitt who had been the desk officer for Liberia and as it turned out Alex
                    Davitt ran the A-100 course when I came in. But, he knew a fellow by the name of
                    Paul Cleveland whose name is pretty well known.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I called him and introduced myself and we talked a bit about the
                    Service He told me about passing the exam, what you needed to know to pass the
                    exam. For example, for the orals in particular, I asked what's the best way to
                    prepare yourself?” He said, “Read the New York Times everyday.” As simple as
                    that. He said, “You've got to be up on events, you've got to show the ability to
                    understand the news.” He gave me some idea of what you're likely to be
                    confronted with at that time, and of how the oral panel was structured and what
                    you could expect, which was helpful, I must say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your discharge from the army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I did. After my brother was killed in June 1965, I escorted his body
                    back to the United States. A friend of my father's, who had a contact in Vice
                    President Humphrey's office, explored the options for not going back to Vietnam
                    since I was a sole surviving son. I declined the offer. I explained that I was
                    not really in a combat situation. I want to complete my time, and I have my men
                    in the section whom I was very close to. I'm still close to some of them today.
                    I said, “No, I want to finish out my tour.” So, I went back and I then departed
                    in October of '65. I came back on a plane with men of the First Cavalry
                    Division. This movie that's just come out titled “We Were Soldiers Once and
                    Young” is about the battle they had just been involved in. It was actually a
                    sequence of engagements and the guys on the plane were those whose enlistments
                    were up. I came back to Oakland and we all knew about the demonstrations. The
                    demonstrators were blocking the gates to Oakland Army Terminal where we were to
                    be discharged. There was a fair amount of unhappiness about this among those of
                    us who just wanted to process out of the Army. We were out there risking our
                    lives and there were people back in the United States berating us as baby
                    killers and this kind of stuff. I thought, I don't agree with them, but I'm not
                    going to make a big issue out of it. Generally speaking it was not considered
                    advisable to wear your uniform when you were back in the States, especially in
                    San Francisco.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: October of '65, right. I took my oral exam in December here in
                    Washington at the Foreign Service Institute in Rosslyn. I came back to my
                    parents' home and stayed there for a couple of months. I took the oral exam and
                    passed it.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall how the exam went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. There were four examiners. Four males; I remember they were all
                    fairly senior people. There was one fellow who was off to one side. He was a
                    labor attach�, in the labor reporting function. They asked me a sequence of
                    questions and I had been told by talking to several people what to expect. In
                    fact, I had a friend who had been with me in Vietnam and he'd gone through the
                    process, and later joined the service. He said, “It's not just a factual
                    exercise. You are being tested to see how you react. They will probe to a point
                    where you don't know anything about what they're asking. Then the question is
                    how well you handle the fact that you don't have the answer. If you try to B.S.
                    it you're going to just work yourself into a hole, and you want to try to avoid
                    that.” So, I was at least forewarned about that. Most of the questions were
                    straightforward, and I remember for example, they asked me about the
                    significance of the Treaty of Rome. I said to them, “My knowledge of that is
                    fairly limited.” And they gave me a break. My father had also told me he had had
                    a friend who'd been in the Foreign Service as well, and he said that when he
                    went for his oral examination they asked him what he knew about Zanzibar? He
                    said, “All I know about Zanzibar is that they grow cloves, and when I've been
                    drinking they have a little bowl of cloves in the bar and you bite into them to
                    cover the smell of alcohol on your breath.” They thought that was a fine answer.
                    I mean, again the question of how you handle yourself is more important than the
                    precision or accuracy of your answers. So, in any event, that went fine, but
                    this fellow from the labor function said to me, “Well, I see this experience
                    you've had as a deck cadet on a Farrell Lines ship to Africa. How much could you
                    really have gotten out of that? Since you're the president of the company's son,
                    I'm sure they treated you with kid gloves.” In other words, his job was trying
                    to provoke me. I said, “Well, that may be your perception, but the reality was
                    that I had to get up early to shoot the stars at dawn. I'd get up at 4:30 in the
                    morning. Deck officer had to know how to navigate by the stars, so I'd come up
                    to the bridge and shoot the stars just before sunrise. I had to chip paint, and
                    do other things like other members of the deck crew to learn their jobs. My
                    father told the captains of the ships that they were not to give me any
                    preferential treatment.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you never mentioned this, what was this deck cadet
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: The deck cadet position was a requirement of; the merchant marine
                    administration for all American-flag shippers, and Farrell Lines was one of the
                    13 at that time, had to create these positions. Every U.S.-flag ship had two
                    berths for deck cadets and two berths for engine cadets. Theoretically these
                    slots were for juniors or seniors from the New York State Merchant Marine
                    Academy, the Massachusetts Marine Merchant Academy, the Maine Marine Merchant
                    Academy and the United States Marine Merchant Academy. So, you had to have these
                    slots and forecastles had to be provided. In point of fact, there were no other
                    cadets, either deck or engine cadets, when I went out on the two voyages I made
                    to Africa. Cadets had a small forecastle with four bunks. My first voyage was in
                    1959. I went out on the last voyage of the S.S. African Enterprise, a small
                    80-passenger ship, the last remaining passenger ship of the Farrell Lines.
                    Obviously travel on passenger ships was no longer viable and they were losing
                    about a million dollars a year on these ships. The principal liability was it
                    carried only about 8,000 tons of cargo, where the general cargo ships carried
                    about 10,000 tons. The difference was enough to make these ships unprofitable,
                    and they had to hire almost as many people to take care of the passengers as the
                    passengers it carried. So, I went to South Africa and up the coast to Louren�o
                    Marques and Beira, Mozambique. Then the ship turned around and sailed to
                    Capetown via Durban, Port Elizabeth and East London. I made that complete
                    voyage. In '60 I went out again. I had to go to summer school at Hopkins for
                    differential calculus, and so I could only make a truncated voyage. I went out
                    on one ship, the African Dawn and returned on another Farrell ship. I went only
                    as far as Monrovia, Liberia, which was ironic, because I ended up being the DCM
                    and Charg� in Liberia. I went to see the American Vice Consul to the old embassy
                    building and I was transferred from the ship's crew list from the one ship to
                    the other ship in front of the vice consul, as was required. I was paid $111 a
                    month. It was a nominal fee and you were to learn the skills of a deck officer.
                    Every watch of the deck crew included two ordinary seamen, one able bodied
                    seaman and a boson. There is a carpenter, a carpenter's assistant and a Deck
                    Officer had to know something about each of those functions. Then you had to
                    learn about stowing cargo and ship operations. While the ship had the Loran
                    system, cadets still had to learn about navigation, shooting the stars and
                    taking noon sun lines and calculating the ship's position. We depended on Loran,
                    but the ship's officers also backstopped it by doing star sights with sextants.
                    They made me go through the entire course that would have been required of a
                    cadet at the merchant marine academy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At any time were you thinking of a merchant marine
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I'll tell you, my father and I did not always see eye to eye on a
                    variety of things, but somehow I felt that if I went into the merchant marine
                    business, I would be dwarfed by my father's achievements in that arena. While it
                    appealed to me to a certain extent, it did not have that extra dimension that I
                    thought government service would provide which is to say representing the United
                    States of America as opposed to the financial interests of a company and a group
                    of investors. That really was a factor for me. I felt it would be very honorable
                    and rewarding to serve the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel that the American merchant marine was
                        almost a dying entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, well, there were a whole other series of issues that relate to
                    that. The American unions were so powerful and politically active; every
                    American-flag ship had four different unions aboard. These were the Masters,
                    Mates and Pilots, the marine engineers union, the radio operators union and then
                    for the sailors, the Seafarers International or the National Maritime Union.
                    They all had to be satisfied and when their contracts came up for renewal, any
                    one of them could prevent a ship from sailing. On top of that you had the
                    demands of the longshoremen. For example, after we came back from West Africa in
                    the African Dawn, we had 375 tons of cargo to discharge in Boston. This is very
                    modest amount of cargo, and it should have taken half a day with a sufficient
                    longshoremen. The first day, we tied up alongside about 10:00 a.m., so we could
                    have had it done by the end of the day if they had been cooperative. The Farrell
                    Lines representative said the longshoremen weren't going to work that afternoon.
                    So we just laid alongside. The next day they showed up but they worked for only
                    about an hour or so, and then they heard there was another ship discharging a
                    hazardous cargo or a cargo for which they would be paid more to handle. So they
                    walked off the ship. They had discharged a couple hundred tons by that time.
                    Then they said they might come back, but they didn't. The next morning they came
                    and it was raining. They said we'd have to rig tarps over the holds for them.
                    The captain called the Farrell headquarters in New York and said, this is crazy,
                    we're wasting money. A 10,000-ton ship in those days cost about $2,000 a day to
                    operate, and we kept having to change the sailing board. Changing the sailing
                    board meant that all members of the crew had to report two hours before the
                    sailing time posted on the board at the gangway. We had to keep paying both the
                    crew and the longshoremen. In the end, the ship carried the remaining cargo to
                    New York and shipped it to Boston by train. It became so uneconomical that later
                    the Farrell Lines didn't call in Boston anymore because the longshoremen were so
                    corrupt and so unwilling to cooperate. So, that was a key element in the decay
                    of the American merchant marine industry. It was both the onboard unions and the
                    longshoremen, as well as cheap foreign competition that crippled the industry.
                    The maritime administration tried to keep the merchant marine as a vital defense
                    industry by subsidizing construction, and operating costs, and it would make up
                    operating losses. When it came to the crew demands, the government would simply
                    let the crew dictate what the shippers had to do. For the operator, there was a
                    point at which the business was no longer profitable. Oftentimes companies would
                    sail under a foreign flag, and then they could hire crews of any nationality.
                    They might or might not have American captains. It was said at that time in the
                    early '60s that the cost of operating an American ship was twice as much as the
                    next most expensive ship, which was the British. Shippers were forced to hire
                    redundant crew members. For example, a C3 cargo vessel sailing to West Africa
                    carrying almost 11,000 tons of cargo had to have 52 men aboard. A ship of that
                    size shouldn't need more than about 24 men, but you had to have all the
                    union-required positions filled.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like American railroads.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, essentially it was. They were very much similar in regard to
                    subsidies. The industry was under constant fire, and only when special
                    circumstances would arise such as the Vietnam War, did they make a profit. When
                    there was a requirement for American bottoms to carry cargos such as AID cargos,
                    they did well. This sector became increasingly important part of Farrell's
                    business because of AID's activities in Africa. Over the long term, the
                    prospects never seemed very good. The more so if it had to keep this bloated
                    personnel structure and try to keep it operating. I remember for example, the
                    day before we arrived at New York, we had to ship the booms from their stored
                    position at sea and raise them so they can discharge cargo. According to the
                    agreement between the unions and the shippers, you've got to turn out the entire
                    deck crew to ship the booms, and you have to pay them two hours overtime. It
                    takes about 20 minutes to complete the job. The First Mate did not turn out the
                    entire deck crew, instead he had the watch do it. So, the union steward aboard
                    the ship came to the first officer whose job required him to deal with union
                    issues. The steward said he was going to protest this when we get back to the
                    pier in Brooklyn. The first officer explained himself, and the union rep said, I
                    don't care, we're going to protest. The mate said, all right fine. I talked to
                    the first officer after the representative left and he said, well, this is small
                    potatoes. We'll let this go, we'll pay it off and we won't make an issue out of
                    it because it's better to concede something small than to have the shop steward
                    find some other issue like the food or some procedure that would have to be
                    changed.. He said, it's better to have something small like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know as consul general in Saigon, we had these ships and
                        of course we had the normal, more than the normal province because many of
                        the people applying there were difficult. The old China coasters and the
                        whole thing. The way we dealt with this was when the ship arrived, my
                        office, the consul general's office had a coast guard officer assigned there
                        and had a union representative, the master's mates, Pat Kelly was the man.
                        But they would board the ship and so all of a sudden they would be faced
                        with one, the coast guard, two, and a union representatives and with the
                        consular people behind them. That stopped an awful lot of crap.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, that's a good move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back to the Foreign Service exam, after the union
                        guy needling you and all this, any other things coming up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, as I said, there were a couple of other subjects on which they went
                    beyond my knowledge. I must admit I took refuge in the fact that I had been in
                    Vietnam, and I hadn't been able to track so issues as well as I might have. They
                    seemed to buy that explanation. I recall the session lasting just shy of three
                    hours and my recollection is that we did have a very short break.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because when I was doing it in the '70s, we'd limit
                        ourselves to about an hour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Is that right? Well, this was a fairly grueling process and you were
                    told to expect it to be up to three hours and that they would let you know
                    immediately after the session. You'd have to wait about 20 minutes or a half an
                    hour it find out the outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it's a long 20 minutes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I felt I had done reasonably well in presenting myself. I realized I
                    was on, that this was “show time.” I guess I succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, let's see, that was in December and then I got married to my
                    first wife at the end of that year. We were married on the 30th of December.
                    Then I waited for an appointment, and nothing came and nothing came. Then
                    finally the department advised me on relatively short notice, can you report to
                    the A-100 class starting on March 31st?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: 1966, right. I said, well, I wasn't doing anything else; I didn't have
                    any other career plans at that time. We'd rented an apartment, but I sure was
                    anxious to have some hard information. In retrospect, that was a pretty quick
                    turn around. They had talked about maybe the summer, but all of a sudden a
                    training position apparently came open at that time. So, I reported for the
                    first day and I remember my expectations versus the reality when they assembled
                    the A-100 class. I'm trying to remember what the class number was A-57. There
                    were 37 people in our class. There was one female and 36 males. They were all
                    white and the fact that there was only one female was noted by the class. There
                    were three lawyers, there were about half with masters degrees, but most of us
                    were just a bachelors degree. More than half had military experience. Contrast
                    that to today, or even 20 years ago. It's really quite extraordinary in terms of
                    advanced degrees and military service. I had a vague sense of what kind of
                    people is this organization was likely to attract. I must say I was favorably
                    impressed. The people were all articulate and reasonably friendly and
                    gregarious; probably the average officer was more gregarious than I was inclined
                    to be. Some of them were overly self-important, which always happens in a group
                    like that. Alex Davitt, our Coordinator took quick control of the group. We were
                    sworn in the next day which had turned out to be April Fools' Day. That became a
                    standing joke, was this for real since it was April Fools' Day. The A-100 class
                    was six weeks at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds about right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I will say this about it; the A-100 class had a standing or stature
                    that was such that the group had access to the highest levels of government. I
                    remember we visited Congress. We had a session with Congressman Derwinski from
                    Chicago and Congressman Gallagher from New Jersey. Gallagher later went to jail
                    for his connections with organized crime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Derwinski almost did, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Derwinski got into trouble too, but for other reasons. Derwinski later
                    became the Counselor of the Department of State. At that time he felt compelled
                    to berate us all for being less than “true Americans” because any red-blooded
                    boy from Chicago would never even contemplate going into the Foreign Service,
                    which “true Americans” all knew to be a very effete group of individuals, that
                    did nothing more than attend cocktail parties. We took that on board and that
                    became part of the lore of the A-100 class as well. We also met with Secretary
                    Rusk and the session made a lasting impression on us all. Vietnam was still very
                    much the hot item, and we looked forward to hearing his position on it. We were
                    actually brought into the Secretary's suite and seated in a small reception
                    room. We were encouraged to ask questions after he made a brief presentation.
                    Questions were rather tentatively asked about Vietnam, and I remember
                    particularly one about the French role there because there had been some recent
                    French initiative about the neutralization of Vietnam, as they had advocated
                    when I was there. What the French were trying to do was to preserve their
                    economic interests and their regional influence. Secretary Rusk responded in the
                    manner he did in the public; very soft spoken, but firm, and non-demonstrative.
                    He said, “The last time I saw De Gaulle I said to him, 'You don't have a voice
                    in this matter if you don't have any chips on the table.” I thought, very
                    impressive. Certainly more backbone than the public perceived. Everyone
                    appreciated that we got to see the Secretary, and were able to ask him
                    unscripted questions. He was a very gentile man, I had occasion to deal with him
                    on the phone at a later stage of my career, and he really was a true Southern
                    gentleman. I think we all felt that we were people entering an elite
                    organization, and that we could call in these kinds of tickets and talk to
                    senior level officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned one thing you got married? Just to get a
                        feel, what was the background of your wife, how did you meet her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. We dated when I was at Fort Holabird in Baltimore. Actually I
                    first dated one of her very best friends and I met her and decided to date her
                    instead. We began dating steadily. I went off to Vietnam in October of 1964, and
                    we corresponded faithfully. In fact she came out to Hong Kong with my Mom as
                    chaperone, when I was on R&amp;R. When I returned from Vietnam, we got engaged.
                    We made arrangements to marry shortly thereafter. The Foreign Service thing it
                    seemed to intrigue her. Her Dad was a road inspector for the State of Maryland
                    and her Mom was of Polish origin and a homemaker. Her Dad was Irish. She hadn't
                    had much foreign exposure, but it sounded pretty intriguing to her. She was a
                    very bright woman, graduated from the University of Maryland as an English
                    major. When we went to our first post, Hong Kong, it became much less attractive
                    to her than she thought it would be. That and other things were of at the core
                    of our marriage coming apart.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The Hong Kong assignment was a fluke. As we got close to the end of the A-100
                    class, the list of available jobs was provided and you bid on the ones that
                    appealed to you. I had focused on Singapore and when the assignments were given
                    out at the end of the course, I was told that I was going to go to Singapore. I
                    thought that was great. I had to take the Asian area studies course and I was on
                    probation in French. I had studied French in high school and college, so I
                    decided to take French. Taking French training and being assigned to Singapore
                    was a bit bizarre. I completed my French training but fell shy of the required
                    3/3. I received a 2+/2+ and, in those days you just did the prescribed term of
                    training, four months in this case, and that was it. If you didn't get your 3/3,
                    too bad for you. Off to Singapore, even though you knew you weren't going to be
                    speaking French in the normal course of things. We had to vacate our apartment,
                    our household effects were to be shipped out on Wednesday and we were to vacate
                    on Friday. On Monday of that week, personnel called to say you were not going to
                    Singapore. There had been an undertaking by the Singapore government to limit
                    the size of the Soviet embassy in Singapore, and in order to limit their size,
                    they also have to limit the size of the American embassy. So, the junior officer
                    slot that I was to be filling has been eliminated. I thought, oh great. They
                    said I had a couple of options. You can either go to Taiwan or to Hong Kong.
                    We'll keep you in the East Asian area. I asked when they were going to tell me
                    which post I'm going to. I'm packing out Wednesday. What post are we supposed to
                    put on the packing crates? They said, they would et me know by Wednesday. Sure
                    enough they called on Wednesday and they said it looks like you're going to go
                    to Hong Kong. I said, okay, when will you know for sure because I've given up
                    our apartment. They said, we'll let you know. Sure enough on Friday they called
                    and said you're going to Hong Kong, and the orders will be cut. So, I gave up
                    the apartment and we went to my parents' place and we had a bit of leave before
                    heading off to Hong Kong. It was a rather bizarre way to do business because
                    since the end of the A-100 we had been focusing on Singapore, its laws, culture,
                    history and political situation and all that. Now we're told at the last minute
                    we're going to Hong Kong instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you went out to Hong Kong? One other question, I keep
                        going back, but, how did you fit within your family with politics? You
                        mentioned your grandfather was a socialist and your father moved up into the
                        capitalist ranks. Where did you fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I don't know, sort of between the two, but leaning more toward my
                    father's side. People have asked me, did the fact that your grandfather was a
                    prominent socialist, and was actually the socialist candidate for Mayor and
                    Governor of New York, ever adversely affect your security clearance. It frankly
                    never came up. I never made any effort to conceal it. The Department must have
                    felt it was far enough distant that it was no longer an issue. The fact that my
                    father was a businessman, and therefore a capitalist, was probably a factor. I
                    remember once listening to an interview with my father recorded on a record
                    disk. The interviewer introduced him on a show as a “shipping magnate”. My
                    father said, “I'm not a shipping magnate. That always meant to me the person who
                    owns the ships. I just operate the ships. You can't really call me a magnate.”
                    He was viewed as being a great supporter of capitalism, which he was. I used to
                    talk to him a bit about it. He loved to sail and he owned first a 36-foot cutter
                    and later a 41-foot yawl. We used to sail on weekends during the summer, almost
                    constantly. It gave me the opportunity to talk with him about his life and his
                    experiences, which someday I hope to write. I asked my Dad “what about your
                    father, was he the sort of socialist who really felt the pain of the people and
                    was concerned about their welfare and well-being, or was his approach more
                    theoretical?” He said, “It was more the latter than the former.” He said that he
                    felt that the workingman was getting the short end of things in dealing with
                    management and industry. My grandfather was a great orator. He used to travel
                    all over the East Coast to give speeches to socialist gatherings. He spoke at
                    Madison Square Garden on a number of occasions with tens of thousands of people
                    coming out to hear him. I remember my father's saying that his father was more
                    captured by the theory of Marxism, and how it could correct the social
                    inequities. In fact, even after he was run out of the American socialist party
                    and lost his job as editor of the New York Call, he remained a Marxist. When the
                    communists came to power in the Soviet Union, he visited the Soviet Union. When
                    he came back, he had found it less enchanting than he thought it would be. He
                    was troubled by the absence of individual rights, but overall he thought it was
                    a great experiment, something well worth doing. As for myself, I have remained
                    an independent. I was not as pro-business as my father, who saw the unions as a
                    scourge. Of course the maritime unions were pretty rough characters. There's no
                    question of that, but I never saw it in those terms. I felt that there was a lot
                    to be said for the rights of the workers and they need their position
                    represented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well you were in Hong Kong from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: From October of '66 to '68, and that turned out to be a very
                    interesting time. That was when the Great Cultural Revolution spread into Macau
                    and Hong Kong. I was in a traditional rotational position. I started out in the
                    NIV office of the consular section. I did six months there and then I was told
                    that I was doing six months in the China mainland section. Then I would do six
                    months in the Hong Kong-Macau section and then six months in the commercial
                    section. In any event, I did the six months in the NIV section, which was damned
                    interesting in its own right. The NIV was the best part of consular work in Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether your time looking at people in
                        Vietnam, I mean your investigatory juices must have been flowing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, to a certain extent that's right. As you know as a consul general
                    who served in that region, fraud was endemic. We had all those great stories
                    about how if every Chinese female claim of their children were legitimate, then
                    every Chinese women who lived in San Francisco prior to the 1906 earthquake and
                    fire would have had to give birth to 80 male children.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before the fire destroyed all the records.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. Then there was “baby Wong.” At least seven people immigrated to
                    the United States claiming to be baby Wong, a child born in Hawaii of a Chinese
                    couple who were returning to China. Because they had not named the child yet,
                    the birth certificate said “baby Wong”, Wong being the most common name in the
                    world. They returned to China and seven people successfully immigrated to the
                    U.S. using that name. The great bulk of the applicants in the NIV section were
                    student visas. They had all kinds of stories. We had a fraud investigation unit.
                    It probably still exists today, and it had two officers and as many as a dozen
                    investigators. They were finding things like visa schools where they were taught
                    how to answer questions posed to a visa applicant. They learned the questions in
                    a certain order, and they would know the answers in that order. So, you were
                    encouraged to change the order of the questions occasionally. So, you'd say,
                    where do you go to school? They'd say 1947 or something like that. They didn't
                    really understand English at all. In fact, 92% of the successful applicants for
                    student visas adjusted status in the United States; most of them were able to do
                    so by virtue of their education and skills they had learned in American
                    universities. They had skill levels so high that they could only be contributors
                    to the American society. In addition, the University of Hong Kong at that time
                    had openings for about 2,500 people, and every year they had 25,000 applicants.
                    So you knew anybody who went to the University of Hong Kong was an
                    extraordinarily competitive student. The visa applicants would show you their
                    ordinaries, their advanced level exams, their A levels, and you'd go over all
                    this documentation to have a general sense of their eligibility. There were
                    people applying who'd come from mainland China. Our locals, FSNs, were cracker
                    jack, the best I've ever had, would identify anybody who recently arrived from
                    the mainland; they'd put a little red star, very subtle, on the corner of the
                    cover sheet of the application. That alerted you that, at a given point, after
                    you've done your visa interview, you were to contact the agency section there
                    and . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly; to come down and they'd conduct their interview. They were
                    very interested in finding out what they could. The agency rep would say, thanks
                    very much, we'll send somebody down and we'll meet you in the stairwell. Just
                    tell the applicant that you want another consular officer to talk to him. I
                    thought, well fine, this is really great. They took themselves quite seriously,
                    but they would interview the applicants in a broom closet or in the corridor.
                    They seemed to be most interested in conditions in the mainland. I never sat in
                    on the interview; we were not encouraged to do so. You made your decision about
                    whether the person was qualified or not for the visa before you brought the
                    agency people down to talk with them. That was a continuing practice and
                    apparently it was a fairly significant source of the information because the
                    mainland in those days was virtually completely closed to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is as you say the cultural revolution was
                        really hitting this place big and hard. How did that reflect where you
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, the spillover started in Macau, which had only a marginal impact
                    on us directly, but it did serve as a model for the Maoists in Hong Kong. We
                    used to go over to Macau on a hydrofoil. It was a quaint backward little city,
                    which had some decent third-rate hotels and guest houses, and you could get a
                    very nice meal. You could go for a day or occasionally overnight.</p>
                <p>It started as a labor confrontation and, of course, the influence of the
                    communists in Macau was much stronger than it was in Hong Kong. The Portuguese
                    obviously didn't have the ability to protect Macau if it were ever threatened
                    militarily by mainland forces. The communists made these non-negotiable demands
                    for reforms that would have essentially transferred power to them. The
                    Portuguese said they could not afford to make the reforms, so the communists
                    would start humiliating the administration and shutting down industry and
                    transportation. They would strong-arm other unions not to cooperate with the
                    Portuguese. The Portuguese kept giving in and by the end of the confrontation
                    that went on for three or four months, the Portuguese had essentially turned
                    over the decision-making to the communists. The communists had control not only
                    through the unions, they also controlled most influential businessmen who were
                    either communists themselves or were paying off the communists in order to
                    continue to prosper. They then were able to ensure that they could continue to
                    do business. It was more useful to them to have the Portuguese as the titular
                    power there rather than to be absorbed into the mainland and lose all identity
                    and influence, and especially a window on the world. So, they allowed the
                    Portuguese to remain. Remarkably, Macau didn't really change very much. I recall
                    in the very beginning of the confrontation there was a clash between the small
                    Portuguese military garrison and the communist provocateurs. The military opened
                    fire and killed nine people. That incident tore the fabric of civility between
                    the two sides. As a result of that confrontation, the communists always harked
                    back to the martyrs and how brutal the Portuguese were. When things finally
                    quieted down and the communists effectively ran the colony, the consulate
                    discouraged us from visiting Macau. .</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I did visit once and saw evidence of demonstrations and slogans spray-painted on
                    the walls. You could still get a decent Portuguese meal. Most of the transport
                    was rickshaws. We had been told that it was not a good idea to be seen in a
                    rickshaw lest we look like “imperialist.” It was still a very quiet and lovely
                    place to go. Subsequently Macau was developed by the Japanese with casinos,
                    hotels and prostitutes. Gambling was legal there, but the casinos were pretty
                    Spartan. The Hong Kong Chinese were told by the authorities not to go over there
                    to gamble. Likewise, the Portuguese authorities told the local people they would
                    not to be allowed into those casinos because that would be one more grievance
                    against the government. They were already impoverished and gambling would be one
                    more problem to deal with. Foreigners were welcomed and casinos offered all
                    kinds of games of chance. The communists were very encouraged by what they had
                    been able to achieve politically in Macau, and had every reason to assume that
                    they could apply it in Hong Kong. It really is quite an extraordinary story how
                    that process unfolded and how badly the communists miscalculated in Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's correct. The communist agitation started in early 1967 and it
                    revolved around a strike at a cement factory, Green Island Cement, I believe.
                    That confrontation spread to the bus union in Kowloon. The communists had a
                    long-standing practice of gaining control of transportation unions, not unlike
                    the problem that my father confronted with the maritime unions at Sheepshead Bay
                    Merchant Marine training center. The unions at that time were in the hands of
                    communists or communist sympathizers. In Hong Kong the communist had a strong
                    hold on the transportation unions that operated the buses, the trams and the
                    ferry. So, when they started with the bus company and they shut down the bus
                    routes that resulted in a tremendous disruption to the industrial system. This
                    was years before the subway came into existence. The economy immediately began
                    to feel the impact. The British company that ran the bus system fired all the
                    strikers. The communists responded, “See how the imperialists treat our people.”
                    The communists put the strikers on their dole, giving everybody a 40-kilo bag of
                    rice every month. Likewise, the workers fired from the cement plant were
                    supported by the communists. Then the cement company hired replacements from the
                    infinite labor pool. One of the great attractions of Hong Kong is the
                    availability of cheap labor, some of which was fairly skilled labor. The
                    communists decided to push the confrontation further. They then took on the Star
                    Ferry, which was the principal connection between Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.
                    When they went on strike there, the British military immediately took control of
                    the service. This link is absolutely essential. The ferry company again fired
                    the strikers and hired a new group when it was turned back over to civilian
                    control.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The British were very methodical and very intelligent in handling the
                    confrontation with the communists. The Chinese communist party existed quietly
                    in Hong Kong, as did the Bank of China and a number of communist or
                    mainland-owned department stores. There were other communist banking
                    institutions and they all threw their weight behind the local communists. They
                    started the process of disruption in the downtown area, the Central District.
                    They received permission to march up past the consulate to the Governor
                    General's Office, across from a large park. They would go everyday in orderly
                    groups representing different organizations; groups of maybe 100 to 200 people.
                    They carried placards denouncing British actions and they would march in front
                    of the governor's palace for the prescribed time, perhaps two minutes to
                    protest, and then they had to move on. The British had available about 15,000
                    police, maybe 20,000 police auxiliaries and 15,000 army troops including
                    Gurkhas. They had three battalions of Gurkhas, and, I think, three battalions of
                    British troops as well. The Hong Kong regiment was a unit of Chinese,
                    Chinese-Caucasian mix and Caucasian. The Hong Kong regiment dates back to before
                    World War II. The British were prepared to mobilize this entire array to ensure
                    order. They would avoid the confrontation that the Portuguese had experienced.
                    The march on the Governor's Office went on for days. We'd look out the windows
                    of the consular section as they marched up Garden Road past the consulate. They
                    didn't seem to focus on the fact that we were there. They would all be waving
                    their books of Mao's teachings and chanting in unison. The communist officials
                    would stack up the different groups while the police watched them through the
                    whole process.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Then the word was that the communist was not getting what they wanted out of this
                    process. They were not getting the hoped for support of the local people, and
                    the British were not making any concessions. The communist decided they had to
                    have a confrontation. The most logical way to do that was to create an incident
                    in front of the governor's palace. They decided to have one group refuse to move
                    on after its two minutes was up. The British had penetrated the communist
                    leadership with Chinese members of their police, and they knew the communists
                    plan. They knew the day, the time and the group that would act. So they
                    positioned thousands of police concealed in this park across from the
                    governor's. Sure enough when the time came, and the protestors refused to move
                    on and the police descended on them with overwhelming force. Having broken the
                    rules made by the British, the marchers were forced to disperse. Then the
                    governor issued an order that the demonstrations in front of his palace were now
                    forbidden. “We had an understanding; you broke the understanding, the deal is
                    off.” The communists responded, “You cannot stop us, we are the people, we will
                    do what we want to do.” So, they massed again the next day in the Central
                    District and they started the march in large groups, carrying Mao's Little Red
                    Book. The British were waiting for them in their thousands. The confrontation
                    occurred just below our consulate at the end of the Peak tramway. There was a
                    big parking area at the end of the line. I have a picture of it; the car park is
                    full of police trucks ready to haul away the protesters. Again, thousands of
                    police backed up this time by the military. They wanted to keep out of sight and
                    were very discreet about it. The protesters came up to this point where the
                    police were blocking the road, and confronted them. The police were six feet
                    deep with shields, helmets and tear gas guns. A senior police official told the
                    demonstrators “You had an agreement, you broke the agreement, and now you're not
                    allowed to pass through this point.” The communists looked over the crowd which
                    was many thousands and replied, “You can't stop us.” Well the British did stop
                    them. When they failed to disperse, the police fired tear gas and the groups
                    fled.</p>
                <p>They formed up the next day and conducted the same kind of confrontation. The
                    more rowdy the groups became, the police picked them out and hauled them off.
                    The governor decreed a state of emergency and the British used preventive
                    detention, and they hauled these people off in vast numbers. They were detained
                    in Kowloon and at a large stone prison at Stanley on the south of Hong Kong
                    Island. The Stanley prison was right above a popular beach at Stanley. At a
                    later stage when there were thousands of protesters in this prison, you would
                    walk past the prison on a Sunday afternoon to go to the beach and these
                    communists were all singing the song “Mao is the Great Helmsman” and the “East
                    is Red.” To hear this singing in unison was impressive, and a bit intimidating.
                    The detention center set up in Kowloon was in open area and over the months of
                    confrontation, there were thousands there. The British made clear they weren't
                    going to take anymore nonsense.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The reality was that a majority of Hong Kong residents who did not support the
                    communists and a small percentage backed the regime in Taiwan. While many of the
                    pro-Taiwan groups would just as soon not have to show their colors, as this
                    confrontation unfolded and the communists overplayed their hand, the little blue
                    and red flags of Taiwan appeared. We estimated that about 10% of Hong Kong's
                    population sided with the mainland in virtually anything the communists
                    proposed, except for actually taking over the colony. About 5% were probably
                    with the Nationalist Chinese, and they assumed that this confrontation would
                    eventually go away. Most Chinese came to Hong Kong to do business, and for a
                    better life.</p>
                <p>We believed that the majority of the people were undecided and they were very
                    uncomfortable with the events. The confrontations continued for months. The
                    British held firm. The consulate had contacts with the Hong Kong police because
                    of immigration and welfare and whereabouts issues. We also had FBI, INS and
                    Treasury representation. The Hong Kong police set up a procedure by which every
                    time a protester led the chant, hold up the Little Red Book up, they photograph
                    them. They then figured out from their mug books, who they were and would then
                    arrested them in 3:00 am and haul them off to a detention center. Over time they
                    undermined the communist leadership in this way, and they did so methodically.
                    Finally the British decided that marching up to this blockade point right by the
                    Hong Kong Hilton Hotel was no longer acceptable. The communists believed that
                    the British couldn't possibly force them to break up. So, then the communists
                    decided to shift their approach and they started having ad hoc demonstrations in
                    various parts of the city. They'd start with several hundred people convened in
                    a given area and they'd create some kind of a disturbance that stopped traffic.
                    In Hong Kong even in those days, all you had to do was to stop traffic for five
                    or ten minutes and the place went into complete gridlock. They did, and the
                    British formed flying squads of police to confront them. The police were using
                    tear gas and then began using the rubber bullets as well. They'd bounce them off
                    the pavement into these crowds. They had a fair amount of success in breaking up
                    the gatherings and they arrested a large of people. Then the communists decided
                    that they would begin a postering campaign. They would put up posters throughout
                    the entire colony with denunciations of British rule. This effort, of course,
                    had its origins in the poster denunciations in Beijing which was part of the
                    Great Cultural Revolution there. The local leaders were trying to reflect the
                    true Maoist spirit and thereby enhance their own credentials. .</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>As observers we did not have the sense of the divisions that existed in China
                    also existed among the groups that confronted the British. There seemed to be a
                    fair amount of unanimity. There weren't the factions favoring Mao Zedong or Liao
                    Shau Chi, who was later discovered to be a traitor and died under mysterious
                    circumstances. In any event, the British simply weren't cowed for the
                    communists' poster campaign. The British passed an ordinance declaring postering
                    to be illegal. Anybody caught postering would be arrested and detained, and if
                    they try to flee, you can use force to detain them, or fire their weapon if they
                    flee. The communists were convinced that the British could not possibly prevent
                    postering. The British then mobilized every military policeman and auxiliary
                    police and military reservists in the entire colony. In one night they took down
                    or painted over virtually every poster and painted over every slogan they could
                    find. The next morning the communists and the rest of the town just couldn't
                    believe the British success. The communists believed they represented the people
                    and no one could stop them from carrying out their campaign. So, the British
                    started detaining the offenders. postering on the spot, and if they fled, the
                    police did fired at them. They wounded some and they killed some. The postering
                    campaign went on, but at a much lower level of intensity after the British had
                    proved they had the will to try to stop it.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>The next phase of the communist campaign was bombings. The communists began by
                    wrapping bombs in containers and they put slogans on them. The object of the
                    exercise was to show their ability to place bombs anywhere they wanted in the
                    colony, like in the heart of the central or financial district. Very early in
                    the process the British seized all the explosives at all the construction sites,
                    and all the firecracker factories were shut down. They took the explosives
                    because they figured bombing campaign could be a real problem. Again, the
                    Chinese communists thought they could do whatever we wanted. The had increasing
                    problems getting the explosives. I think they place something on the order of
                    12,000 “explosive devices” over the next six to eight months. Of these 12,000
                    devices only about 1,200 contained explosives. The British organized flying
                    squads and the leading demolition expert was a fellow they called “Bomber”
                    Harris, named after the Head of Bomber Command in the Second World War. He would
                    go to the scene, sandbag the device and blow it up. Despite the British efforts,
                    a number of the bombs did blow up. Some people were killed, mostly innocent
                    bystanders. By the time the whole campaign was at the end, I think about 90
                    people died in the bombing campaign including a few of the bomb disposal people.
                    In the most egregious case, they planted a bomb near a child's elementary
                    school, and when the kids came out to play it exploded. Two children were
                    killed. That proved to be a watershed event, when, combined with other
                    atrocities, that the majority of the Hong Kong Chinese found unacceptable, like
                    the disruption to business and tourism, the majority progressively turned
                    against the communists. During the height of the Cultural Revolution, Hong Kong
                    fishermen were snagging bodies in their nets that had floated down the Pearl
                    River. These were victims of one faction attacking another in Kwangtung
                    Province. Of course that was the worst josh in the world to pull in a dead body.
                    I mean they would have to bring the body in and turn it over to the authorities,
                    and then they'd lay the boat up for the next three weeks while they went to the
                    temple and lit incense to try to get rid of the bad josh off. This was happening
                    with some degree of regularity, and some days there would be as many as four
                    bodies discovered, some headless and the arms bound. The people in Hong Kong
                    rejected this kind of mayhem. They did not need factional fighting in Hong Kong
                    that leads to people being slaughtered and bodies washing up on the beaches.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>As a result of the bombing campaign and the extremism, the communists
                    increasingly lost the support of the people. It wasn't just that they didn't
                    turn out for the demonstrations, they began to avoid shopping in communist
                    stores and patronizing their banks. Consulate personnel were not allowed to go
                    into any communist enterprise because of the foreign asset control laws, but we
                    used to monitor them. In fact, I did visit a department store, but found that
                    there was nothing worth buying. It really was an eye opener how backward the
                    mainland industry was in so many ways. While buying goods in such a store was a
                    violation of the law, in reality, the Consulate didn't want you to be seen in
                    these stores. In any event, they lost business. While they were losing revenue,
                    they still had hundreds if not thousands of people whom they had promised to
                    give a 40-kilo bag of rice every month, and they were going bankrupt. Finally
                    this financial reality dawned on them. Meanwhile, the situation in China
                    quieting down to some extent, and the local communist realized that their
                    efforts were not going the way it was planned as the people weren't really
                    behind them. Slowly, quietly, they kind of ratcheted down the confrontation. The
                    postering campaign wound down and the people detained were being released a few
                    at a time. Without any overt agreement, the whole thing just sort of quieted
                    down and went away. Business in Hong Kong is business, and they just went back
                    to business. This is remarkable; I hope the Brits get the credit they deserve
                    for their handling of the events, particularly the restraint they exercised.
                    Yes, people were killed and the rubber bullets did occasionally glance on the
                    pavement and hit people in the head and that would be the end of them. I would
                    estimate that the number killed by the security force was probably in the order
                    of 30 or 40, and maybe about 90 people killed by the bombs. One other thing I
                    should say, the British intelligence network was so good that they knew
                    composition and location of the various cells of communists who were planning
                    demonstrations apparently instruction Beijing. The Brits would attack a target
                    apartment at 3:00 in the morning, first from the street and later from
                    helicopter on the roof. Their SWAT teams would grab the suspects before they
                    knew what was happening. They'd seize all the documents and get the lists of
                    people who were involved including donors. With this initial success, the
                    Chinese responded by setting up a warning system, and then they installed steel
                    doors to prevent the SWAT teams entry. So the teams brought steel cutting
                    equipment and torches to break in. When they began landing on top of the
                    buildings by helicopter and repelling down, the Brits would descend on them
                    before they could slam the steel doors. They really kept the communists off
                    balance. It took a lot of organizational ability and a lot of solid intelligence
                    and restraint to bring this whole thing off. They were able to control the
                    colony for some 30 years more as a result of these actions. We used to say, if
                    Mao Zedong wants Hong Kong all he has to do is make a phone call. This implied
                    that he could order an uprising that the British would quickly recognize was an
                    unwinnable situation. Well, he never made the phone call, apparently because as
                    we're finding out today, it's more valuable to him to have an opening to the
                    West than to make it just one more coastal city of mainland China. So, they
                    really didn't want to take over. What they wanted was the Macau situation where
                    the Brits would have titular control of the colony, but otherwise it was
                    business as usual, with the communists dictating political and social issues. In
                    the end, the communists realized their struggle was falling apart; they didn't
                    have the revenues to sustain it any longer. The mainland was so disrupted by
                    this point that they couldn't afford to subsidize the process any longer and
                    eventually they gave up. They stopped providing the rice to these strikers. By
                    this time these people were themselves looking for opportunities in different
                    areas. They got other jobs. The entire exercise did knock the communists out of
                    the transportation unions. They lost their advantage through this process. Once
                    they surfaced and showed their true colors, the Brits made sure that this didn't
                    happen again.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Edwin Rice. It was an interesting time. I learned of the turmoil in
                    China, which I followed when I next rotated to the mainland China section. It
                    was a very talented collection of individuals. It was divided into three
                    sections. There was an economic unit, an international unit, China's relations
                    with the rest of the world, and there was an internal political unit. There was
                    a large percentage o this section who later became ambassadors. They included
                    Charlie Hill, Curt Kamman, Nick Platt, and Herb Horowitz, who became an
                    ambassador to The Gambia. This group was very meticulous and very methodical in
                    culling through all the overt traffic that was picked up on China's regional and
                    provincial radio stations. We had all manner of sources and we were tasked not
                    only to follow domestic internal events from the Cultural Revolution, but also
                    to assess the effect of this turmoil on Chinese support for North Vietnam as
                    that was the hot issue in that region of the world. We did get information
                    indicating that certain factions would intercept Soviet arms shipments coming by
                    train and by truck, and seize the weapons and use them in their own struggle. I
                    worked with the international unit. Al Harding was the head of that operation
                    and I would hope you can get him to give his oral history</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Al Harding. H-A-R-D-I-N-G. He joined the OSS during the war and served
                    in Yenan. He actually met Mao. He spoke both Mandarin and Cantonese. He came
                    into the Service as a clerk in the late '40s and by this time he was I guess he
                    was an FSO-4 or 3 at that point. He later interpreted for Ambassador Gronouski
                    who was our official interlocutor with the Chinese in the Poland. Al was really
                    quite a guy. Anyway, we worked together, and the section used to do a weekly
                    report on events in China. He always managed to find snappy little things to say
                    about what's was happening, using bad puns and clever nonsense that would peak
                    interest in our issues. We used to monitor very carefully how the Chinese
                    characterized every event that occurred. In Vietnam, for example, some U.S.
                    escalation like widening the range of our bombing would incite a rhetorical
                    riposte. We would analyze how the Chinese would respond and what sets of
                    adjectives they would use and then how they strung those adjectives together to
                    determine how seriously they were taking this escalation. They would say that
                    they were “As close to Vietnam as the teeth are to the lips,” and “We are the
                    great rear area for Vietnam. I remember Al doing this cartoon and showing
                    somebody with this tremendous behind and with teeth stuck to their lips. This
                    analysis was also used to monitor what was going on internally. One of the
                    sources we had available was letters from the mainland which were intercepted,
                    translated and then provided back to us. They were a good source on conditions
                    in various parts of China. We would be able to monitor conditions on a province
                    by province basis. In addition, and this is hard to believe in these days of
                    computers, we maintained vast card files. They were in the corridors of the
                    third floor of the consulate near the political section. These card files, of
                    which there were millions of cards, were mostly name card files. They went for
                    the entire length of that wall on both sides. These cards were the originals,
                    and there were carbons made of them for individual files. The names would be
                    transliterated into English and would also have the original characters and so
                    as names were cited, we could check the names out in these files. It was crude,
                    but it was methodically done. We had a whole staff of people who did that kind
                    of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean I take it you were really looking at chaos, weren't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Pretty much. We were trying to figure out what was going on, what is
                    the object of this exercise. When you examined China, you have to go back to the
                    period of the Great Leap Forward. We used to ask you about this period when I
                    was a consular officer. Chinese applicants were asked what it was like in this
                    time. They replied that they were all required to go out and make pig iron in
                    the backyard. Food was in very short supply, but they said, as bad as it was,
                    everybody got something; everybody got just enough to eat despite the extreme
                    shortages. The Chinese government made a heroic effort to make sure that there
                    was a relatively equitable distribution of what food that there was and thereby
                    kept the loyalty of the people. Then came the “Let A Thousand Flowers Bloom,”
                    campaign which encouraged people to speak their mind. Then they then clamped
                    down on people who spoke out. Not right away, they let it go for a while, and
                    then they arrested people that were too outspoken. There was a sense that
                    Cultural Revolution was another such exercise. Was Mao orchestrating what seems
                    to us to be a very chaotic effort which is really a very carefully orchestrated
                    effort to root out his opponents at the top levels and the middle levels, and
                    even at the lower levels. If that were the case, then things were not as chaotic
                    as they appeared. We were following issues like whether China was going to
                    escalate its support for Vietnam, or whether it's still capable of making a
                    threat somewhere else given this apparent chaos? We were not persuaded that the
                    situation was as chaotic as it appeared, but it was very difficult to be
                    certain. We had few reliable sources on the ground at that time. Symbolically,
                    we used to go out to the border and look across at this forbidden land to try to
                    have a sense of the mystery of China. We had people coming out of China, we had
                    intercepted letters, we had access to overt broadcasts and some other
                    intercepted information as well. It was hard to figure out who were the genuine
                    cast of characters because the people often believe they were doing Mao's will.
                    For example, they seized the Foreign Minister, Le Peng and humiliated him. They
                    put a dunce hat on him and dragged him through the streets. If Mao had wanted to
                    protect these officials, he could have protected them. They were disgraced and
                    then they were usually forced out of their jobs. In some cases they committed
                    suicide, and some were probably executed. We really can't put our arms around
                    this whole cultural revolution, because they had the capability to orchestrate
                    this process, while the real object of the exercise was to purge the leadership
                    and not to allow the chaos to go uncontrolled yet demonstrating that the
                    revolutionary fervor is strong in the country. Eventually Liu Shau Chi was found
                    to be the “Great Traitor.” A lot of people that were potential threats to Mao
                    were driven out as part of the cultural revolution, and in the process, tens of
                    thousands, hundreds of thousands of people died as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at this point feeling that gee, I better learn
                        Chinese or were you tempted to be a China hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, you that's an interesting point because in reality the people
                    that were China hands were so steeped in the Chinese culture and language, and
                    the Chinese language was the key. Chinese was a three-year undertaking; you did
                    a year of study in the U.S. and then you did two years at the school in Taiwan.
                    It was a high hurdle; you really had to be immersed in China, its history and
                    its culture, and you had to be prepared to spend the rest of your career dealing
                    with China. I wasn't willing to make that commitment. I wanted to get back to
                    Africa, and, in point of fact, I was still on language probation. In those days
                    you could not get promoted more than one grade unless you were off language
                    probation. I was taking French with a French military attach� who was studying
                    Chinese. He provided French lessons on a tutorial basis three times a week and
                    so I was still working on the expectation that I would end up going back to
                    Africa. I was daunted by the degree of commitment that I would have to
                    undertake, particularly the three years of language training. You only had to
                    get a 2/2 in Chinese to get a promotion, but even so, I was just not prepared to
                    do that. I was very impressed with the people who had. I thought they were very
                    talented people and that we were in good hands with that group. They were
                    extraordinary scholars. They were a kind of microcosm of how the Foreign Service
                    was changing, as well. As our Consul General Ed Rice said when I was invited to
                    his home as an escort officer for a visiting Ambassador, Cecil Lyon. Cecil Lyon
                    is our ambassador in Ceylon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ceylon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. He was passing through and I was his control officer. He and Rice
                    had served together in China in the '30s. There was then a division among the
                    China hands. Rice had all his hotshot political analysts working on Mainland
                    China, but none of whom had set foot on the forbidden territory of China. Here
                    are these two old guys, and they're amusing themselves by telling stories; “Oh,
                    you remember how it was in the summers in Peking . . .” and this and that. Cecil
                    Lyon was a much more self-deprecating individual than Ed Rice. I mean Ed Rice
                    was okay, but you could go back and look at his history at the time when they
                    were purging our China watchers in the McCarthy era. He was able to dodge that
                    bullet effectively, but not much to his credit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Cecil Lyon I think was married to Ambassador Grew's
                        daughter or something like that. He was of the, he was to the manor
                        born.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He was indeed. He acted that way, but he was also very appealing to the
                    younger officers because, in response to Rice trying to play this game at this
                    elaborate dinner of excluding these officers from the conversation of the good
                    old days. Lyon was at the far end of the table and he's fiddling with this brass
                    lantern and Rice was getting agitated that Lyon was focusing on this lantern
                    instead of listening to his conversation in which he's trying to put his
                    subordinates in their place. So, Cecil Lyon says, “Geez, I can barely remember
                    that, it was so long ago.” Wrong answer! It was clearly not what Rice wanted to
                    hear. He kept on about it, and Lyon dodged the conversation every time. He was a
                    very fine man I must say, a really nice guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, by the time you left there, you left there in '68
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I left in '68 and by that time I had bid on jobs in Africa and I was
                    quite intent about it. I should say that after the China mainland section, I was
                    then assigned to the commercial section as the last part of my rotation. While I
                    was in the commercial section the procedure of rotation of junior officers came
                    to a close. So, everybody was frozen in place. I did my last 11 months in the
                    commercial section. It was fine. I learned a great deal about commercial
                    reporting and a lot about the business. Even in those days you could get trade
                    figures that were off early versions of computers, so economic analysis was
                    relatively easy to do by contrast to what I found in my African assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hong Kong was playing a major role in the Vietnam War,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was. It played a role in several different ways. We had major
                    R&amp;R activities in Hong Kong. At any given moment there were over 2,000
                    American GIs in Hong Kong. We had a procedure that was agreed upon with DOD's
                    R&amp;R people based in Hong Kong, the defense attach�s and the Coast Guard
                    people. The operative rule was that anybody who came to Hong Kong, and most came
                    in by charter air, whoever breaks any of the laws or rules or regulations in
                    this colony would be sent out on the next plane returning to Vietnam. We had as
                    many as four planes arriving and departing a day, although some marines would
                    fly their own C130s. As a result, they were the most well behaved group of
                    soldiers you could imagine, and the perception of both the British authorities
                    and the Chinese was these guys are so much better behaved than the British
                    soldiers that were based in Hong Kong. The Chinese were happy to have them;
                    certainly they were happy to have their money. However, there were limits. The
                    U.S. aircraft carries would come up from Dixie station and?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yankee station.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yankee station. Right. The British felt that if an American aircraft
                    carrier were to sail into the inner harbor it would be a provocation to the
                    Communists. So, they insisted that they anchor instead off Lantau Island and the
                    sailors, over 5000, would come to Hong Kong by launch. They figured that every
                    aircraft carrier would put a million dollars a day into the local economy and
                    they didn't want to turn their backs on that. So, they let them come, but they
                    kept them at a distance, but fortunately the American sailors and GIs handled
                    themselves well. I remember one instance, where some military type on R&amp;R
                    brought a gun with him. He was detained and returned to Vietnam on the next
                    flight. He lost his R&amp;R after waiting for months to qualify. Of course, they
                    came for the liquor, women and a hot shower, which represented the civilized
                    world. The colony was well set up for that sort of thing. Overall, I would say
                    we came out very well with the British authorities at the time. There was
                    another factor on the economic side, the U.S. bought a lot of goods in Hong Kong
                    to support our troops in Vietnam and that was good business. American naval and
                    supply ships were going to Vietnam via Hong Kong in support of our effort. The
                    British wanted to avoid provoking the communists at this delicate time by having
                    too high a profile of American military activity. Basically the Chinese
                    residents thought, well, yes, there's a risk, but there's also the reward in the
                    amount of money these guys spend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. I again bid on jobs in Africa. This was back in the days of the
                    “Star Chamber” when you had no idea what jobs were available, or how the
                    assignment process was done. I received a message saying that I was to be
                    assigned to Khorramshahr. I asked the personnel officer, where? He said,
                    Khorramshahr; apparently it's in Iran. Even he didn't know where it was. I
                    wondered how the hell did they come up with that? I was very unhappy about it,
                    but I did find out more about the post. It's the dry cargo port for Tehran and
                    they speak Farsi. I was on language probation for French and I was not going to
                    have any chance to get off language probation, as French was not used there. I
                    thought this is insane. Here I am putting myself up for posts in Francophone
                    Africa and they're going to send me to Iran. I thought this really is indicative
                    of a system that doesn't take into account an individual's preferences or
                    abilities. So, I thought I ought to make a stink about this assignment. I told
                    the admin counselor, that I was unhappy with this assignment. He said, “You
                    know, you are just coming out of Hong Kong, one of the great posts of the world.
                    Nobody is going to listen to you if you say you don't like your onward
                    assignment.” I thought this doesn't make any sense. They haven't even thought
                    about this assignment. He didn't know anymore about the assignment process than
                    anyone else did. Then I talked to Dwight Scarborough who is the head of what
                    they called the Hong Kong-Macau section, which is basically the economic
                    section. He was a very decent guy and a senior officer. I said to him, “What
                    would you do under these circumstances?” He said, “Well, here's what I would do.
                    I'd draft a letter very carefully and explain to them how you're more than
                    willing to serve wherever they send you, but there seems to be an inherent
                    illogic in this assignment. Mention the French language issue in some detail.
                    Point that out to them the irrationality of the assignment without being
                    confrontational. Make clear that this is very important to you, that if they
                    cannot see it in their hearts to reconsider this assignment that you're going to
                    have to look into other options.” So, I drafted a letter very thoughtfully, and
                    showed it to him. He made some suggestions, I finished it up and I launched it.
                    I sent it off in the pouch figuring, are they are going to reconsider or are
                    they going to pull the rug out from under me. I headed off for the U.S. My wife
                    and I were separating after anguishing about it for some time. She went home
                    directly via the West Coast, and I decided that, since this may be my last go
                    round in the Foreign Service, I'd go the other way around the world, the old Pan
                    Am One flight that stopped in Bangkok, Rangoon, Calcutta, Bombay, Tehran, Beirut
                    and then through to Europe. I'll stop in Istanbul, Vienna, Paris and London just
                    to see those places at least once. I headed off not knowing whether I was going
                    to be in the Foreign Service or not by the time I got home. I send my itinerary
                    to Personnel if they wanted to get in contact me they could do so through the
                    personnel office in the embassies in any of these cities. But I only made the
                    effort of checking in Vienna and they said they didn't have anything for me. So,
                    I went to Paris and London and back home. I returned to the United States and I
                    called Personnel to talk to somebody about my letter. I was given an appointment
                    with a fellow who did assignments for junior officers. Personnel was structured
                    differently in those days. Peter Spicer was the responsible officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Peter, I knew Peter in personnel at that time.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. I had an appointment on a given day, and I showed up at the
                    office. I gave my name and the secretary says to me, “Oh, yes, you're the one
                    they're reassigning.” I said, “Oh?” She said, “Oh, you didn't know?” I said,
                    “No, I didn't.” She said, “Well, would you feign surprise when you go in?” I
                    said, “Not to worry.” I went in and Spicer said, “Obviously, they weren't paying
                    attention when they made your assignment, it doesn't make any sense at all.” He
                    said, “There are several options.” He said that there was one in a slot in
                    Abidjan and then there was one in Fort Lamy, Chad. He said, that our ambassador
                    to Chad, Sheldon Vance, was at the UN at this time for UNGA and he'd like to
                    talk with candidates to see if you'd be the right person for his small post. It
                    was basically the ambassador, DCM and political officer and I'd be the
                    consular/economic/commercial officer. I said I'd like to meet with the
                    ambassador. So, I went to see Sheldon Vance, a very fine gentleman. He thought I
                    would do fine, and so the deal was cut. I headed off to Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you went to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Fort Lamy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 22nd of March, 2002. Keith, you want to talk a
                        little more and go back to Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: If I could, yes, I would like to say something about our sense of what
                    was behind the efforts by the communists to try to take over effective control
                    of Hong Kong as a part of the Great Cultural Revolution. First of all, in terms
                    of our sense of the conflict, we really didn't feel terribly concerned about our
                    personal safety other than being in the wrong place when a bomb went off. We had
                    a strong sense that the communists, in employing its most extreme efforts such
                    as the bombing campaign, were primarily trying to attract attention to their
                    cause. They were trying to push the British into retaliatory actions that would
                    provoke a backlash and thereby sway a larger number of the uncommitted
                    population Hong Kong to their side. But the reality was that they were not very
                    successful in that, and even their bombing campaign which included some 10,000
                    explosive devices, worked against them. Of these 10,000, probably not more than
                    a thousand actually contained had any explosives. There were very few casualties
                    given the number of devices. No one really felt that they would try to bomb the
                    consulate. By contrast to today, for example, where we are vibrating over the
                    “War on Terror,” there was nothing of that sort at that time. There was no sense
                    that we would be car bombed or anything of that sort. All the bombs were small
                    containers, usually bottles wrapped in red paper and they'd have a slogan on the
                    side, “Down with the Imperialists and all their running dogs,” slogans that
                    they'd taken from Mao's teachings. So, on the personal side, we really didn't
                    feel that threatened by the conflict. It was disruptive to our lives, and the
                    one thing I forgot to mention was that during this confrontation, the Chinese
                    Mainland cut off the water supply to Hong Kong. Hong Kong's catchment areas
                    provided enough water for more than a half a year to provide for the water needs
                    of the population in a normal year. The reservoirs usually would fill up through
                    the monsoon season and then in the summer, the dry period, the British turned to
                    the Chinese to provide water through large pipes that ran along the rail line
                    from China. Well, at this juncture, the Chinese were very coy about providing
                    the water. The modalities were that every year an application was made by the
                    Hong Kong government to the Province of Guangdong, the provincial authorities,
                    to ask them to turn on the pipeline for the summer months. This time the
                    governor of Guangdong refused to answer the British request. They decided they
                    weren't going to acknowledge the legitimacy of the British control of Hong Kong.
                    So, the water did not flow. Well, the British started water rationing. At first,
                    we had 12 hours of water a day, and then we had eight hours a day, then eight
                    hours every other day and eventually at its peak, or nadir, we were down to four
                    hours every fourth day. The British handled it remarkably effectively. They
                    divided the entire colony into A, B, C and D sectors. Where we lived, for
                    example, up on Coombe Road, we were in B sector, and across the street was D
                    sector. We had friends living in apartments across the road. We would store
                    water when it was running in jury-rigged 50-gallon containers in the bathroom.
                    So, we would oftentimes, when they had water, our friends would come to our
                    place with their towels and in bath attire. In turn we would go down to their
                    place and take a shower no matter what their social activities were going at
                    that time. Whether they were having people to dinner or cocktails, you'd come in
                    your bathrobes and have a shower and you'd go on back home. By this method we
                    were all able to get by. Then the monsoon season came early, and then a typhoon
                    that passed over the colony. That was the first time that the eye of the typhoon
                    had passed over in over 60 years. It refilled the catchment areas very rapidly
                    and then the British didn't need the water from the mainland. At that point the
                    government of Guangdong decided to respond to the British request. “Oh, by the
                    way, regarding your request made some four or five months ago, we will now agree
                    to provide water.” The British paid about a million pounds sterling for the
                    water, which was nothing to be sneezed at that particular time. In any event the
                    British said thanks, but no thanks.</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I would say that's not inaccurate. I think that it certainly started
                    from a reactive approach to the communist countries' presence. Why did we need
                    to monitor all these small African countries? Now, we did have a small agency
                    presence there as well and, beyond our efforts to influence attitudes of the
                    host government vis-�-vis to support our positions in the international
                    organizations, we also hoped to pick up possible defectors from the Soviet bloc
                    countries. Agency presence in Africa was, in their minds, fairly clear. There
                    were opportunities that might not exist, and probably didn't exist in Europe,
                    where the Soviets and bloc types were much more closely monitored. We were also
                    caught up in the concepts of development means stability; we viewed ourselves as
                    engaged in fighting on the frontiers of freedom. That development was the key to
                    economic security, and from that, you would see changes in their political
                    structure. This would lead to a more representative government, once you have
                    economic security, then you have the incentive and the time to start thinking
                    about your political structure. After the wave of independence in the early
                    1960s, AID, in its wisdom, decided to target just one of a group of ten
                    countries, and, as you know AID's strategy toward Africa shifted over time. It
                    began by trying to have a presence everywhere, and assist in specific areas
                    health, education and rural development. Then AID realized that certain of these
                    tasks should be done by the host government and it decided to concentrate in the
                    most promising countries. There were ten focus countries, the tenth being
                    Nigeria. Nigeria, with its oil wealth decided that they didn't want to accept
                    the strictures that Americans attach to assistance, so it opted out. Of course
                    Chad wasn't one of the remaining nine. AID had a marginal program, but it
                    arranged for a beefed up special self-help fund and we were able to do a fair
                    amount of useful projects with that. I was the self-help officer. One of the
                    better projects was to assist an Israeli lieutenant colonel with the Israeli
                    Mission there. Chad had diplomatic ties with Israel despite the Muslim influence
                    in the north. The Israelis were also very selective in its assistance,
                    specializing in security and reforestation. This lieutenant colonel had a
                    background in reforestation as he had been sent by his government to the
                    southeastern part of Israel and told, “Here are 60,000 acres. find something
                    productive to do with it.” He decided to start a forestry industry. As I
                    understand it, the area is a center of forestry to this day. He was certain he
                    could do the same in Chad which was losing its forest at a shocking rate
                    annually. He asked for some assistance from us as well as from several U.N.
                    agencies. He asked that we provide him a small bulldozer, a CAT D6 I think it
                    was? We made the arrangements which seemed to take forever. I got to know this
                    guy, Lt Col Hatuel, and to see how he did business. He was a real operator. He
                    was given a small plot of land near the airport and he set up a nursery. The
                    first year he put in 60,000 seedlings. He was able to do so because he had a
                    food for work program with the United Nations. The U.N. was always late in its
                    deliveries, and he would sign his name for food from U.N. other projects to be
                    repaid when his food arrived. He signed for everything with the Chadian
                    government and aid agencies, and he got away with it. From 60,000 seedlings the
                    first year, he had 300,000 seedlings the second year. He had found an old fuel
                    tank from an old airplane to water the seedlings in the nursery. He later found
                    a tank truck. cleaned it out and put it up on pilings then used it to water the
                    plants. He was just unstoppable. I was very, very impressed with what he
                    accomplished. He got his bulldozer eventually.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The problem with all development is follow-through. There's got to be
                    sustainability built into the projects. While Hatuel got his 300,000 seedlings
                    started, and then distributed them, it became a matter of keeping the goats from
                    eating them. It was at this phase that things began to fall apart. In fact one
                    of my favorite AID stories was about a German aid project in the southwestern
                    part of Chad which we visited, Ambassador Todman and I visited. The idea was to
                    set up a hog growing operation by teaching animal husbandry. They required the
                    Prefect of that region to provide candidates for the training. They would arrive
                    with their wives and families. This was a two-year training “stage,” and they
                    were assigned housing and would grow their own crops to sustain themselves.
                    They'd learn the science of breeding and raising pigs. If they were successful,
                    and there was a substantial dropout rate. At the end of the training, the
                    trainees would be given a sow and a boar, the payoff for their efforts, and went
                    back to their home village where they would raise their pigs. Given that they
                    were not Muslims, they were more than happy to have the pigs; they loved pork as
                    a meal. The Germans completed the cycle and eventually they learned what
                    happened. Well, what do Africans do when you've been away for two years? They
                    have a party. And what do you serve at the party? They served the two pigs that
                    were supposed to start their herd. The Germans finally figured this out. They'd
                    been there about five years when we visited their facilities. There were
                    stainless steel counters in the most backward part of the boonies in Chad, and
                    here was this fantastic facility they'd built. They had decided to pull the plug
                    on the project because, despite their best efforts, this cycle was happening
                    over and over again. There was no dissemination of knowledge for this industry
                    at all. They were very dispirited, but this is how you learn your lessons in
                    development.</p>

                        you people English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. Well, it's a fair question. We felt, with some justice, that
                    there was an interest in learning more about the United States, and English was
                    a mechanism to help them do that and also offered the possibility that they
                    could study in the U. S. There were some scholarships and scholarship assistance
                    available to them. We'd help them contact colleges and universities. We just
                    generally thought that that was the wave of the future and they would be better
                    off having a knowledge of English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, this being even at that time was rapidly
                        English was becoming sort of the commercial, the international language much
                        to the dismay of the French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. Absolutely. Because the French language is the foundation of
                    Francophonie, the French essence, the French mindset, if you will. There was a
                    fair amount of intellectual debate at that time, and Senghor's concepts of
                    negritude were actively debated. The French were perpetuating this debate. They
                    would organize these conferences; this is the days when de Gaulle was agitating
                    in Quebec.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Cooperantes, not unlike our Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cooperantes. We're talking about you got there in '69. The
                        May and June of '68 were the great period for particularly this class of
                        people. I mean these are the young students, the student revolt and they
                        essentially knocked de Gaulle out. I mean it took a little while, but I mean
                        was that spirit of it was in a way their Vietnam. It was part of the '60s of
                        what was going on. Was that hitting them or did it have anything to do with
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. Right. Well, it did. As I say, they were very sophisticated, quite
                    cynical people and I sensed that they took some pride in the fact that they were
                    able to bring down de Gaulle, but they also felt that, very quickly thereafter,
                    politics returned to the way they were. There was a transition and they felt
                    that the waves have just swept back over what they had done. Pompidou did not
                    have the stature de Gaulle had, but the young leftists felt they were back where
                    we started. That's why they were disinclined to discuss their own country's
                    problems because they felt that France had again fallen under the control of the
                    rightist coalition. They weren't really full of fire. My sense was that their
                    commitment to Chad and the Third World was pretty uneven. I had a sense that
                    they were just doing their time. This was the same period that Vietnam was going
                    hot and heavy. The Tet Offensive had taken place and the U.S. had a substantial
                    number of forces still engaged in Vietnam. So Peace Corps volunteers were
                    looking at their options, and several were re-enlisting for a third year in
                    Chad. I visited the volunteers in eastern Chad and it was pretty rough. I'd been
                    in Vietnam and their circumstances were much worse than Vietnam would have been.
                    Granted they wouldn't have to shoot anybody or be shot at, I suppose, but in
                    terms of what they went through in order to avoid the possibility of the draft.
                    This seemed was pretty extraordinary to me.</p>
                <p>One of the most successful Peace Corps programs we had a program of well
                    drilling, and I think this ought to be recorded. We had teams of well drillers
                    who were supported by the government of Chad and also by certain international
                    organizations. I think the U.N. had some input as well. Theses teams did
                    extraordinary work and they left something valuable behind. The need for potable
                    water is paramount, and the world is always in deficit which was certainly the
                    case in Chad. They would go in with their trucks, drills and pipe, and they
                    would put in a well with no fanfare. The pumps were simple to operate and
                    maintain. Sometimes they would do open-faced wells and they'd line them with
                    cinder block. Some of the young men, and I think it was only all men, went on to
                    positions of great responsibility in the U.S. government after that
                    experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about wells, I've heard that one problem was as
                        you began to develop these well areas and all this it began to change the
                        migratory pattern of herders which was an unfortunate problem. It means that
                        they all gather and they're not moving from one spot to another and all
                        sorts of bad things happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. This happens. It didn't really happen in this project because we
                    were doing these wells in the south where the sedentary peoples were. So, it
                    didn't change the patterns. The watering stations that we set up with Self Help
                    funds along the main cattle route had marginal success to be candid about it,
                    but the cattle were channeled the terminus in Fort Lamy where they were
                    slaughtered for local consumption and export. I know of the case in Mauritania
                    where USAID became involved in exploiting and expanding the traditional watering
                    holes. Of course, they immediately attracted more herders with their herds and
                    they soon used them up and the watering holes became useless. Then the herders
                    had to move again, and now you had more people in movement depending on fewer
                    and fewer watering holes. That's true; it does tend to change things in that
                    Saharan or upper Sahelian region. In the sedentary areas, wells were a more
                    permanent improvement.</p>

                        came during the '70s wasn't it?</hi>

                        watch out. What happens on the next thing? I mean were people looking ahead
                        towards that or not?</hi>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Not really. Everybody knew how important the rains were and in Sahelian
                    Africa. I later served in Mali as well, and these people live and die by the
                    rainfall. They gauge the “petites pluies” that start in March in those cases and
                    they gauge how long they last and how heavy they are. Then, from that they
                    hypothesize what the main rainy season is going to be like, and based on that,
                    they make their decisions. The sedentary people make planting decisions, and
                    herders make decisions about moving their cattle to new pasture lands based on
                    those brief rains. The Sahelian people are more knowledgeable than others about
                    rain prediction. Our development people viewed this as a permanent problem and
                    realized that there were constraints on what donors could do about it. Not only
                    because they could not control the rain, but they realized that were limits as
                    to where the government can allow the herders to move their cattle without
                    provoking major ethnic conflicts. If the herders enter farmers' lands, their
                    cattle will soon spread out and there will be clashes, as occurred from time to
                    time when I served in both Chad and Mali. Thank God, neither group was very
                    heavily armed, so it didn't lead to many people losing their lives. Another
                    constraint on the movement of herds was that below the 13th parallel the cattle
                    would become infected tsetse flies and would die and their meat was putrefied.
                    In view of these constraints, donors looked for reliable sources of water like
                    the Niger River to the west of Chad and Lake Chad. Unfortunately Chad's water
                    resources are mostly on the westernmost border and in the southern half of the
                    country.</p>

                        parlay Le Blanc, in other words, let me talk to the guy in charge, really.
                        Was this the case there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, there was an effort to conceal the role of the French advisor
                    because, as I was saying about negritude, there was an increasing sense that the
                    African leaders of the former colonies had to assert themselves, distinguish
                    themselves from the French. Be that as it may, the functioning of government was
                    really in the hands of the “conseilliers.” These are the seconded French
                    functionaries who are assigned there for two or four years or more. They liked
                    the neo-colonial life; the life was reasonably good and they did make things
                    work. Generally, we didn't cultivate them because there was an understanding, as
                    represented both a donor nation and they were host government representatives,
                    this would be inappropriate. If there were a Frenchman in the ministry, we would
                    deal with the Chadian officials and you didn't deal with a Frenchman. Some of
                    our AID people wanted to deal with the advisers, but we would discourage that.
                    We wanted to give the Chadians the full measure of sovereignty. Yet we made
                    errors in doing that because we received commitments from the government which
                    it didn't have the wherewithal to implement. We had a program that seemed
                    extraordinary promising on the northern coast of Lake Chad, a lake increases and
                    decreases in size by a full three times annually. In the dry season, as the
                    water recedes it leaves behind low-lying areas that are called polders. They can
                    be farmed successfully because of the rich sedentary soils. Further, there are
                    few insects or pests to attack the plants, and the fields didn't need
                    fertilizer. So, we sent six Peace Corps volunteers there as a pilot program with
                    promises of support from the government. The Peace Corps deserves tremendous
                    credit for their effort. The volunteers flew to Mao on the Lake and then were
                    taken by truck and then the last leg by camel. The only thing that distinguished
                    them from the local people was that they were given this little kerosene-fired
                    refrigerator to keep their beer cool, should they ever see one. Other than that,
                    they lived just like the Chadians there. It was a great concept, and the
                    production was excellent. They produced potatoes, and a variety of agricultural
                    products on a serious scale, but when it came to marketing, the roads weren't
                    available. If the volunteers came in by camel, how did you food get out? This
                    became the choke point, and the Chadian government didn't come through with the
                    promised roads.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>There were six volunteers in this program and we went up to visit them. They
                    talked about what the great prospects the project had. Within less than a year
                    this whole project had collapsed because, along with all the hardships, the
                    volunteers had to plow under the excess crops because they couldn't get them out
                    to market. The produce was rotting in the fields. Eventually, all six of them
                    abandoned the project. Some of them had a very rough time of it; some were
                    reassigned, and some just quit. One had to be psycho-vac'd out, and another one
                    came through my office. I must say, I'd had never seen an American quite that
                    filthy before, he wore in a pair of shorts, period. His legs were filthy up to
                    his knees, his hair was wild and he smelled. He told me he wanted to go to
                    Cameroon and he wanted his passport, he had a Peace Corps passport. So, we
                    issued it to him because he was entitled to it, but about six weeks later the
                    Cameroonians expelled him. They said they didn't want this fellow here. But I
                    mean they were all demoralized from the way in which this project had been
                    undertaken and we much share some of the blame because we bought their promises
                    that they'd be able to do these things. Now, if you went to the French and you
                    said, will you work with us? First of all, they're probably not inclined to help
                    you and I know they sidetracked a number of our proposals that they just put to
                    one side and they never came to anything. The Chadians were not prepared to take
                    the French on again. Again, one thing I think the Americans have to appreciate
                    about French influence in Francophone Africa is that a leader of a Francophone
                    African country can get on the phone, assuming the phone lines work, to the
                    President of France and have a conversation. He can talk to him about his
                    concerns and problems, and has a reasonable expectation that the president will
                    be responsive and provide him what he needs. On the few rare occasions that I'm
                    aware of where African leaders tried to call the American President, they'd get
                    blocked at the White House switchboard. So, they said, well, we hear all these
                    great things about America, but what's important to us is to talk to your
                    leader, as this is the way in which Africans work among themselves. If the
                    American leader doesn't know who the hell I am, well, I've just been diminished
                    in my peoples' eyes. The French President always took the phone calls. Sure, the
                    leaders were whining for this or wanted that, but that's how things were. The
                    French involvement and influence in Africa really turned on these kinds of
                    favors, it was the fact that they could talk to the chief. Chief of State and
                    receive a sympathetic hearing. I know in 1980s there was an acute crime problem
                    in Abidjan and so Houphouet called, I guess it was Giscard at the time, and said
                    he needed urgent help. Within days the French airlifted a dozen new patrol cars
                    and provided French police advisors and weapons, etc. That's the kind of
                    response the leader is looking for. If you asked the Americans to do that, we'd
                    have to study the issue, negotiate an agreement and arrange procurement and
                    shipment. We're talking a couple or three years and he had to deal with the
                    problem right then. There's no substitute for that. You have to have that
                    willingness to be responsive and the French did and we couldn't handle that. So,
                    our ability to influence events was obviously very limited as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about turning to foreign affairs, I mean I realize
                        you were pretty close to the bottom of the totem pole, but what about Libya
                        and Sudan? I mean these were difficult countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: They were, and both of them were active at that time. As I say, the key
                    political event in the foreign affairs of Chad at the time was the overthrow of
                    King Idriss and the ascent of Muammar Qadhafi who quickly assumed the role as a
                    magnet for Arab radicals. He viewed his southern flank as vulnerable to his
                    pan-Arab activities. There was an ongoing concern about him and, of course, he
                    soon became something of a demon in the American hierarchy of demons, albeit
                    that Libya was distant from the U.S. and not likely to be much threat to
                    immediate American interests. We felt that the French strategy of having Chad
                    serve as a buffer was probably overdrawn, and we were skeptical about Qadhafi's
                    actual ability to immobilize the Islamic minority in Chad. They were a very
                    decided minority in Chad, Niger and Mali, but he was testing the waters in these
                    countries. Ironically, ultimately, he had some success. It wasn't necessarily
                    Qadhafi, but the Islamic peoples of the north did eventually get control of the
                    government in Chad, and yet all the profitable former colonies on the coast are
                    under no more threat than they ever were. Ultimately, whoever runs the show in
                    these coastal states has got to think about their own domestic problems rather
                    than worry about regional threats.</p>
                <p>Now, in Sudan the issues were similar, yet different. There was a north-south
                    conflict, really a civil war between the Islamic north and the animist and
                    Christian south. We'd occasionally see refugees from the south come through Fort
                    Lamy, the capital, and we would try to get some sense of what was going on. We
                    realized we didn't have much influence in that region. Ironically, I later
                    became the desk officer for Sudan, and by that time Nimeiri had hammered out a
                    peace with the south, and essentially shoved it down the throats of the Islamic
                    north. This effort eventually brought the civil war to a close, at least for
                    awhile. Again, the Chadians' concern was that this conflict would ebb and flow
                    across the border because, as elsewhere in Africa, the people who live along
                    these borders are usually the same group. They know nothing about the importance
                    of these national frontiers, and they moved back and forth without concern. So,
                    these armed elements were always a matter of concern in this area of Chad. When
                    Chad's Islamic dissidents in eastern Chad would trade food for arms with these
                    people, it unnerved both the Chadians and the French. I remember going into the
                    southeastern part of the country, the provincial capital of Am Timan. We flew in
                    on a rainy day. You see we had this 1946 DC3 that was based in Fort Lamy, and
                    the DAO had regional responsibilities all the way from Niger to Gabon, and
                    Cameroon and Mali. So, our Ambassador could use it quite a bit. When we arrived,
                    the security forces were people going around in ponchos, with sub-machineguns
                    and even grenades in their hands. We thought, what in the devil is this all
                    about? Of course, it was because of the instability in that province about which
                    we heard nothing in the Capital. And that was in the southeastern part of Chad,
                    not the northern regions which was in open revolt out side of the provincial
                    capitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it from today when we're concerned about
                        Islamic fundamentalism, was this a concern of ours at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, not so much fundamentalism, but the concepts of Arab nationalism
                    and the degree to which it was opposed Western culture, Western concepts of
                    democracy and representative government. Nasser had mobilized the Islamic world,
                    and his successors and other Arab leaders were still agitating. You had the
                    alliances between Libya, Egypt and Yemen. There was a concern that these
                    activities would be an obstacle to Western access to resources of the Arab
                    world. This nationalism was then rather low key, and we recognized that it was
                    played up to enhance the legitimacy of otherwise shaky regimes. In the Arab
                    world you had military governments, you had the Baathists, you had the
                    conservative kingdoms and they were in conflict with one another despite that
                    Arab nationalism. The Israelis were active in Chad in order to keep a foothold
                    in this area to keep an eye on Qadhafi and his activities. They had a small
                    military assistance mission to provide training for bodyguards and small arms,
                    and some economic activities, very focused and directed activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any visits from Washington at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: We had of all things we had a congressional delegation of five
                    congressmen from the House Agriculture Committee. Chad had never hosted five
                    congressmen during its entire nine years of independence, and we had them all at
                    one time. They came up from Cameroon by air and we took them across the Chari
                    River to Cameroon by pirogue. You think of cultures sort of gliding past one
                    another in the night, the way in which this whole visit worked out was a version
                    of that. The sultan of Khoussary on the Cameroonian side had been briefed on the
                    visit by through his general factotum. The congressmen were ushered into this
                    big whitewashed mud chamber, and were seated on a straight-back banquet against
                    one wall, and the sultan sat on a throne facing them. After a long silent
                    hiatus, the sultan says to his assistant, his vizier or whatever, “Who are these
                    people?” The Americans were saying the same thing, who is this guy, why does he
                    get to sit on the throne and we on this hard bench? After an exchange of formal
                    greetings and some desultory remarks, the ceremony came to an end and the two
                    cultures went their own ways. It was such a logistical headache to get the CODEL
                    back and forth across the river because there was just the one ferry that
                    crossed the river every hour; it was an unbelievable effort for the meager
                    return. The CODEL's alleged purpose was to assess our modest AID program. You
                    can hardly call it a boondoggle, as coming to Chad was no treat. Of course, what
                    they really were looking for were prospects for selling American agriculture
                    products. We did provide a fair amount of PL-480 wheat to Chad, and these wheat
                    sales were a big issue in West Africa. The French had a monopoly on wheat
                    imports; it was essentially dumping, I suppose, it was mostly subsidized aid
                    donations. The French were resentful of PL-480, and, once again, considered it a
                    part of a larger American conspiracy; we were providing Africa agricultural
                    products to displace French influence. In reality, they were simply looking for
                    markets for U.S. agricultural products in exotic locations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left there in 1971? Were there any coups or
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. Yes, there were several events that shook the government. The
                    President was Francois Tombalbaye. There was evidence that Libya was supporting
                    the northern insurgents, and this pressure combined with the failing economy
                    drove Tombalbaye to embrace the philosophical concept that was dominating in the
                    Francophone Bantu areas. He decided he had to rediscover his roots. He was
                    influenced by people like Mobutu Sese Sekou and like Mobutu, he dropped his
                    first name Francois and replaced it with Ngarta Tombalbaye. Further, his
                    official photographs, which had been air-brushed after independence to remove
                    his tribal scars, where restored to show the scars. He was a very handsome man.
                    He had three scars on each. This was the beginning of a larger political
                    purge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We used to call it a member of the 111 club.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: After I left, Tombalbaye began to test the loyalty of his subordinates
                    by their willingness to undergo traditional initiation ceremonies called Yondo.
                    This purge started then, but it was developing during my time. It reflected the
                    fact that Tombalbaye was concerned about his legitimacy and his ability to
                    retain power, not so much from the north, so much as his own people because they
                    were becoming more educated, and more demanding of the rewards of independence.
                    Development was stagnant and the single party state was suffocating. His
                    objective was to rally his people behind him as the Chief of State. Also, there
                    were charismatic leader like Bokassa from the CAR to the south. He was a popular
                    beyond his borders for his anti-French statements, and I remember when he came
                    to visit for an OCAM meeting. The crowd reaction to him was stunning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the emperor at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He was not the emperor, at that point. He was just the chief of state,
                    which was bad enough given his brutal rule. He was a real rabble-rouser; there's
                    no question of that. He was well regarded and well received by most of the
                    southern Chadians. They seemed to be attracted to him because he put his finger
                    in the French eye. He came to Fort Lamy for this meeting of Francophone heads of
                    state in Central Africa and he was, by far, the biggest attraction. When he
                    drove down the main avenue through the crowds in a procession with other chiefs
                    of state came; everybody cheered and surged forward to see Bokassa. That evening
                    there was a reception at the presidential palace along the river; the former
                    French governor's residence. The Diplomats and the senior officials were all
                    waiting there at our various tables as the invited African leaders arrived. This
                    wait went on for more than an hour. We waited for two hours and most of the
                    chiefs of state had arrived. Finally Bokassa was the only one who had not
                    arrived. Chadian radio had a live broadcast from the Presidential Palace, and
                    reporter was on the grounds talking to arriving guests. Noting the delay in the
                    leaders coming out of the Palace to begin the dinner, he made reference to the
                    fact that everyone was waiting for Bokassa. All of a sudden, the gates swing
                    open and Bokassa and all his escort vehicles come roaring in across the lawn.
                    Bokassa jumps out and gets a hold of the commentator and says, “By God, I'm glad
                    you told me that I was the only person missing. I didn't know what time this
                    thing started.” He charges into the building, while we're all out on the lawn
                    assembled at the tables. After the form al dinner, Bokassa was reported to be
                    partying in the quartier dancing until dawn. He has invited Tombalbaye to join
                    him, but the Chadian was a much more conservative individual. He was concerned
                    that Bokassa had a tremendous amount of influence in the southern part of the
                    country and Tombalbaye had to find ways to counter that. That's one of the
                    reasons why he returned to these traditional ceremonies of Yondo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Nigeria being an Anglophone country, but with a
                        significant border, I mean small, but a significant border, which was the
                        main commercial outlet, play an important role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: All commerce had to go across the neck of northern Cameroon and then
                    down through Nigeria. At this time, Nigeria was in the grip of the Biafra civil
                    war at this time, and their primary concern was about any of their neighbors
                    helping the Biafrans. We had perhaps 20,000 Ibos mostly running businesses in
                    Chad. There were in Fort Lamy and other major towns; they were very adept
                    commercial people. They were undoubtedly sending money back for the Biafran
                    cause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, the French were messing around in Biafra weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: They were. We never knew exactly how significantly, but they were
                    concerned about Nigeria's size and potential influence in their realm in
                    francophone Africa. They were also interested in Biafra's oil resources which
                    the Biafrans thought a significant nation. On the other side of the coin, the
                    Hausa in northern Nigeria are closely linked to the Islamic groups in Mali,
                    Niger and Chad. The French had to play this game very carefully, but their
                    interests in the region required that they keep a hand in. In fact, I had to
                    pick up my car, a Jeep, in June 1969. I flew to Lagos on the WACASC plane and I
                    drove it to Fort Lamy over five days from Lagos. That was a particularly tense
                    time during the war and I was stopped multiple times at military and police
                    checkpoints. I was advised not to drive after dark because the guards at the
                    checkpoints start drinking about that time, and they were likely to open fire if
                    they see a car after dark. Several Americans had been fired upon. These were the
                    conditions I had to make my way through. Just north of Ibadan, I picked up a
                    policeman in uniform. Every time we'd come to a checkpoint he'd put on his hat
                    and tell me to go to the front of the line. This worked great. After I dropped
                    him off, I picked up a military policeman who had a submachine gun, a Sten gun,
                    and we made it through all the checkpoints without any problem. I was a bit
                    unnerved when we initially took off from the checkpoint and he said “Stop, I
                    forgot something.” I backed up, he ran out and returned with his Sten gun which
                    he then laid across his knees. I wondered if he forgot his weapon would he also
                    forget to put on the safety.</p>
                <p>By comparison with CAR and Chad, Nigeria had a good road network. Chad had only a
                    few hundred miles of paved road. It's a country that is three times the size of
                    California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Chad in 1971? So, as you leave a country, whither
                        Chad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I felt that Chad's prospects were very clouded; that the
                    government was really fumbling around trying to figure out what direction it
                    wanted to pursue. It was overly dependent on the French, and this was a problem
                    because the French would go with whatever regime it thought would serves its
                    best interest. Tombalbaye was increasingly caught up in his struggle for
                    legitimacy, depending increasingly on coercion rather than his personality and
                    persuasion. So, my sense was that Chad was headed for trouble. On the resource
                    side, cotton and livestock were very vulnerable to drought because of the weak
                    infrastructure. There was exploration for oil, but with little success in that
                    time. Subsequently, they found oil in fairly substantial amounts. There are
                    certain inherent constraints as well. Chad is landlocked; some 900 miles from
                    the sea. This will always be a problem. It seemed that Chad was always going to
                    be viewed as a buffer state and not much more than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of which I think I interviewed somebody who was
                        saying we were concerned and sent a special delegation down to Chad and
                        other places to get support on whaling. They said, oh yes, we'll support you
                        on this whaling thing, but tell me what is a whale?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's fair, yes. I remember making demarches on the law of the sea.
                    The Chadians responded, “The sea, what possible relevance does that have for
                    us?” It was kind of bizarre.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling I mean here you are essentially in the
                        southern capital, a feeling about as you left there the menace from the
                        north?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, there was. It was our general perception was the Islamic
                    insurgents chances of succeeding was extremely remote because they were few in
                    number, they did not represent the majority of the people. They didn't seem to
                    show any inclination to broaden their base by offering a multiethnic society.
                    While there wasn't a great fear of the insurgency, there was a sense of large
                    murky force in the north. It related to the extent to which the North African
                    Arab and Islamic countries provided support to the northern insurgents and the
                    extent to which this would create a serious threat to the government.</p>
                <p>I had occasion to return to Chad some 16 years later. I don't generally go back
                    to my former posts, but I had a friend who was the Charg� in Cameroon at the
                    time. We made a trip to N'djamena by road, and I found that it had changed
                    markedly; almost unrecognizable. It was now very much an Arab capital and some
                    of the differences were the result of drought, of which there had been two. This
                    trip was in 1987. All the green spaces that I remembered were now pretty much
                    gone. The population of the capital had more than doubled through the civil war,
                    the droughts and the migrations of refuges. It was now so overpopulated that
                    virtually all the trees had been cut down and used for firewood. Where there had
                    been nice villas that had been built for foreign businessmen and diplomats as
                    well as the Chadian elites had green lawns and open fences that let you see the
                    lawns. That was all gone. Now there were masonry walls that were eight feet tall
                    along all these streets in those neighborhoods. The streets were dusty, and in
                    the gloom there were men with AK47s in turbans lounging against the walls and at
                    the street corners. The city had really changed and it seemed a different
                    capital altogether. Of course, it was a reflection of how the country had
                    evolved historically as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is probably a good place to stop, I think. I
                        think it makes it easier. But in 1971, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I was in negotiation with Personnel about my onward assignment. I
                    wanted to serve in the AF bureau. It was the logical thing to do. I thought I
                    had found a home there and I wanted to compete for the job as the Chad desk
                    officer, which would make eminent sense. Desk officer jobs were then much sought
                    after, even AF jobs Instead; I was reassigned to cultural affairs for Africa
                    CU/AF. I thought, good Lord, what is that all about. I found out later that it
                    was because CU Assistant Secretary Richardson was very intent on attracting
                    people from the Foreign Service into the CU Bureau which was a mix of civil
                    servants and Foreign Service officers. So, I tried very hard to find a way
                    around this assignment, but with no success. I later found out that a person who
                    I knew, and who was in the Department, corralled the job, having manipulated the
                    process in her favor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Chad one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: The Chad desk job, yes, which made good sense for the AF Bureau. I'd
                    come to know a certain number of the Africa hands and figured I'd have a pretty
                    good shot at this assignment, but it didn't work out. I figured all right, I'll
                    give this cultural affairs thing a shot. It was a different experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So, we'll pick this up, let me put it down here in
                        1971 when you're back to Washington in cultural affairs for Africa and we'll
                        find out about African culture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: All right. Such as it is. Good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 26th of April, 2002, Keith, you came '71 you
                        were in the cultural affairs office, what was it called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was CU/AF, Cultural Affairs for Africa or the Office of African
                    Programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '71 to when?</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk about it. When you got there what was
                        your impression I mean sometimes cultural affairs isn't the right on the
                        action and all that. When you look at it it's sort of like an exchange
                        program, would have been far more effective than all the political reporting
                        we've done you know, because these usually have gotten to be leaders,
                        anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I felt I was being assigned outside of the mainstream of Foreign
                    Service work, and certainly out of my regional bureau, which I had long since
                    determined would be Africa. But, I figured its African cultural affairs; maybe
                    there are some useful linkages. There were a number of other Foreign Service
                    officers who had been tagged to serve in this bureau as well. John Richardson
                    was the Assistant Secretary, a very intelligent, dynamic sort of individual, and
                    he had said to the Director General; “I want more Foreign Service people in this
                    bureau. We have civil service, they're all well and good, but I want people
                    who've got the overseas perspective.” So, he made a concerted effort to bring
                    FSOs into CU. At a later phase in this assignment he hosted brown bag lunches
                    with his Foreign Service people to get their insights. They told him, “Look the
                    work is okay, but we really are out of the mainstream. We feel that, from a
                    career perspective, this assignment is not doing us much credit in the service.”
                    He said, “Well, what can we do to make it more attractive to FSOs?” I said, “For
                    one thing, you've got to ensure that we get good onward assignments back in the
                    mainstream bureaus and that there be some effort that the evaluations reflect
                    the role that the cultural affairs plays in support of our foreign policy goals
                    in the regions in which we are serving.” He took that onboard, and there was
                    some effort to follow up. We thought it was important to let him know how a CU
                    assignment was viewed by the rest of the Service. In fact, we got some
                    tremendous mileage out of the CU programs.</p>
                <p>This was a particularly interesting time, '71 to '73, as a number of countries
                    were emerging from the colonial experience. We had a lot of students from Angola
                    and Mozambique which we judged would become independent in the near future. They
                    were exiles and were brought to the United States for educational training. We
                    had a program called SASP, the Southern African Student Program, under which
                    some 500 students were brought to the U.S. The concept was that when majority
                    rule occurs in Portuguese colonies and in South Africa, we would like to have a
                    group of people who have studied in the United States, who understand the U. S.
                    and have a level of education to make a real contribution to their own
                    countries. That was the concept; the reality was that this program had started
                    in the middle '60s in an effort to compete with the Soviets who were doing the
                    same sort of thing with the same intent. When the program began our Public
                    Affairs officers throughout the southern African region began selecting anybody
                    who could reasonably qualify. As a result, we got some people who didn't have
                    the academic wherewithal to study in the U.S. They didn't' have either the
                    preparation or the intelligence necessary to carry through on a full four-year
                    program in the United States. So, we lowered the threshold and brought them into
                    SASP at the high school level. By the time I was involved in the program, it was
                    already something of a shambles. The SASP participants were getting in trouble
                    with the law, and they were not able to stay in college. They would then fade
                    into the society, and then there were issues about their visa status. It became
                    a constant headache to try to deal with these administrative problems. Some had
                    mental problems, as disoriented refugees. In some cases they and their families
                    had been the object of great brutality and repression. One fellow had been
                    savagely beaten by the Portuguese.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say he had to be institutionalized? I can't imagine
                        that we were having some problems giving Angola and Mozambique people who
                        were out of the Portuguese orbit. I mean, you know, Portuguese control.
                        Visas, these programs because wouldn't the Portuguese be screaming bloody
                        murder?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, we shut our ears to Portuguese concerns because we felt that
                    history was passing the Portuguese by, and Salazar was the last gasp of
                    dictatorship. South Africans likewise were unhappy about our educating these
                    people who were in opposition to the white regime there. This program does
                    reflect the intense competition that existed in that cold war period in the '60s
                    and into the '70s. The Soviets and Chinese, and the Cubans, to a lesser extent,
                    but primarily the Soviets, were training exiles. There were about 540
                    participants by the time I became involved in SASP. We did mostly the
                    administrative work to see to it that these people stayed in school and to keep
                    them out of jail, and that when they got in trouble, ensure they received proper
                    treatment. There was a fair number that had done well; completing their
                    education. The expectation at the beginning of SASP was that by the time they
                    completed university there would be majority rule in the Portuguese colonies.
                    That was not the case, so they were sitting on their hands, and we had to try,
                    to the extent possible, to regularize their visa status so they could stay and
                    do productive work. I think some did return home eventually, but overall, I'm
                    not sure we got very much in return on this investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the problem is that if they couldn't go right back,
                        I mean our society being so absorptive, you know, they just.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right, exactly, and they'd marry and they'd find jobs and then the
                    appeal of returning home wasn't great, but SASP reflects that the U.S. had to
                    “Keep up with the Joneses”, that is to say the Soviets. Conceptually, I guess it
                    made sense, but the key to success was the individuals we selected, they were
                    not of the sort that we were really looking for, because the pressure to compete
                    caused us to lower our qualifications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think the Soviets had the same problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: They did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because I got a whiff of this back in the '60s when there
                        was a revolt of the African students who'd gone to Sofia and I was in
                        Belgrade, the consular officer there and I had all sorts of people coming
                        through. They didn't like being called black monkeys by their Bulgarian
                        counterparts. I heard that this was duplicated in the Soviet Union, too. I
                        mean in the United States, at least there is a kind of a fit. In the Soviet
                        Union and the bloc there was just no fit at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes and the Russians really didn't know what to make of these exile
                    students, and there was a racist strain in Bloc nations as there is in the
                    United States, and that came back to bite the Bloc countries as well. Yes, we
                    were competing against those who really weren't doing any better than we were in
                    this process. But that's just one dimension of this. What we tried to do in our
                    cultural programs for Africa was to bring potential leaders with the
                    international visitor program which is designed to give grantees some exposure
                    to the U.S. The grants were for 30-days, and USIS would tell us in advance
                    through the PAO what the IVs wanted to do in the United States, and we would
                    then set up the program. We had three programming agencies we worked with and
                    they arranged the specific programs for them. We would talk to the agencies
                    before they arrived, and when they arrived we would go with the grantees for the
                    programming session, which usually lasted three hours or so. The agencies were
                    very efficient in arranging the programs. The visits were a multi-stop tour
                    across the country, and they would have cooperative organizations that would
                    host the visitors in major cities. The IVs could pretty much write their own
                    ticket; if they wanted among to see Disneyland, no problem. Primarily, we wanted
                    them to meet their counterparts in whatever their specialty was. If they were
                    attorneys, we'd meet with other attorneys, judges etc. If they were a judge,
                    we'd meet with U.S. courts at a fairly high level. The programs almost always
                    started in Washington and ended in New York, and the visits were usually
                    coast-to-coast. This gave them a sense of the expanse and diversity of the
                    United States, which is a very useful thing. When we had the occasion, we would
                    debrief them when they returned to the East Coast. They were just ecstatic about
                    what they'd seen and the experiences they'd had. I thought that the Fulbright
                    program, which was about $50 million a year, was probably the best bang for our
                    buck in our foreign policy arsenal. I'm comparing that to my experience in
                    Africa where the aid programs did not get the same mileage for the dollar. We
                    knew that when the Soviets ran a similar program, but it had escorts that took
                    visitors around on a closely supervised program. We had escort-interpreters, but
                    primarily to interpret for those with limited English, and to guide them through
                    our complex society. Whereas the Soviets escorts were there for security
                    purposes, as well as trying to put on the best face of the Soviet Union for the
                    visiting dignitary. About 60% of our IVs would have escort- interpreters; the
                    other 40% were sufficiently sophisticated and had the linguistic skills to get
                    around on their own. In one notable case a Mozambican who had occasion to travel
                    to Texas and on the plane he ended up being seated next to a Supreme Court
                    justice for the State of Texas. They got in a conversation and he explained
                    where he was from and what he was doing here and the Supreme Court justice found
                    it very interesting. The Justice invited the visitor to come home for dinner
                    that night. He went home and had dinner with this Supreme Court justice and met
                    his family and saw where and how he lived. Now, that's something you couldn't
                    stage. The visitor realized that this would never have happened in the Soviet
                    Union, I think we can say with some assurance. That made a lasting impression on
                    this individual. So, I felt that to that extent these programs were very
                    valuable, and we had to carefully select grantees. We didn't have a large number
                    of grants in Africa because it wasn't a particularly focused area, but we had a
                    lot of success with what we had.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>The other side of the coin was sending distinguished Americans to Africa. We had
                    the STAG program, the Short Term American Grantee, and it could last for
                    anywhere from a couple of weeks to as much as a month or so. We would also send
                    various groups out. Now, traditionally they had sent out groups in the
                    entertainment business, musical and athletic groups. . In addition, we sent
                    Kareem Jabbar out with an understanding with his team, the Hawks, that he not to
                    play basketball with anybody because he was too valuable an asset to be allowed
                    to play in some scrum game and get injured. When you get to these African
                    countries, he traveled with a college team from Ohio, and there was a good deal
                    of unhappiness about his not being able to play. There was a sense that with
                    entertainment and sports groups we could make certain inroads, but that was not
                    it solely. There may have been an element of condescension I suppose in that
                    approach, but we also sent out educators and intellectuals as well. I think the
                    thrust was to demonstrate to Africans that black Americans in particular, had
                    succeeded in the United States and had positions of responsibility. The
                    intriguing thing was that our STAGs gained at least as much from these visits as
                    did those they contacted in Africa. I remember we sent two educators named Dr.
                    Engs and Dr. Williams. They were from New Jersey as I recall, and they were sort
                    of scholar/radicals, in the early '70s, and they wanted to visit Mother Africa.
                    We sent them out to southern and eastern Africa. When we debriefed them we
                    learned they had had quite a revelation. They said they described to African
                    audiences in Mozambique racism in America which they compared to South Africa.
                    The audience then asked why American Blacks didn't rise up and wipe out the
                    Whites? Of course, the Africans were thinking about South Africa where the
                    blacks are the majority, whereas they didn't realize that it was different in
                    the United States. The Africans thought since they said it was the same as South
                    Africa, they figured the numbers and the demographics were the same. Engs and
                    Williams kind of looked at one another and said, well, maybe we have a
                    misunderstanding here. That realization kind of took the steam out of the event
                    for them, but it shows that we gave them full range to say what they wanted to
                    say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because in later periods, particularly during the Reagan
                        times I think there was a rather heavy hand on some of this. I mean there
                        was a blacklist or something, but you didn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, we didn't see any of that. We felt that our nation was strong
                    enough to go out and have Americans criticize us, and we had an obligation to
                    let the Africans listen to different perspectives and points of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We had another fellow named John Kinnard; he ran a community museum under the
                    Smithsonian over in Anacostia, a very decent guy. He ran this museum that did
                    exhibitions on such things as rats. Well, rats in the inner city are
                    commonplace, so he did a whole exhibit on their origins and their habits. He
                    thought that's what the people ought to understand, so he used the community
                    museum for that purpose. We arranged for him to go to Africa and meet with the
                    museum people there and see what they have to think. He had a good and rewarding
                    trip there for about 30 days. He had some eye-opening experiences. He said when
                    he was in Uganda and he was told that people are still eating people in Uganda.
                    I said I didn't think that happened, but I couldn't dissuade him. But he had a
                    very productive tour and he did meet with museum folks and got many good ideas.
                    They talked about museum sciences and how you get people to come to the museum
                    and what they should learn when they're there, and how you make a museum a
                    development or a nation-building tool as well. We felt that was a very useful
                    exercise. We also sent Jessie Owens out to Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The famous, well, he was the star of the 1936
                        Olympics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: The '36 Olympics, yes. He was a very nice man, very gentle, soft-spoken
                    fellow, very decent. He was happy to go back to Africa and talk to people about
                    his life. We also had a program in Somalia and Kenya as well to train athletes.
                    There are a lot of superb athletes in Africa; you see them particularly in
                    running events. But they didn't have the training or the equipment. We sent
                    Americans out to do this training on both short-term grants and longer-term
                    grants. CU had one such trainer, Mal Whitfield, a black American, who spent
                    several years in East Africa and did great things especially in terms of
                    identifying Olympic quality performers. He put them into local programs, and
                    then arranged to get them into programs in the States or in Europe where they
                    could develop their talents. I thought this was very valuable to get some
                    recognition for Africa by bringing their athletes, these world class athletes to
                    the attention of the world. CU managed a number of useful programs and frankly,
                    it did not demand a great deal of time or intellectual effort. Two other
                    officers and I would do what CU/AF required, but we had plenty of time for long
                    lunches and to visit museums and local art galleries. We thought, well we're in
                    cultural affairs, we should keep current on the cultural side of Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the interesting thing though sort of from the
                        bureaucratic perspective is that this is the Nixon Kissinger regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right.</p>

                        the cold hand of somebody saying, sort of the handlers or the spinners?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, that's a good point. There was one instance where CU sent a group,
                    called Chicago to Europe in the early '70s. Chicago used a lot of four-letter
                    words, and Congressman Gross, a Department nemesis, learned of it and he cut the
                    CU budget severely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was from Iowa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Iowa, yes. Congressman Gross, but he was on the House Appropriation
                    Committee for State, and the story of his cutting the CU budget for cultural
                    presentation by half or two-thirds of sending this group to Europe. It was a
                    cautionary tale, not to offend the Congress because it had control of our
                    funding. We had our defenders as well, who thought this was a worthwhile
                    program, but we really didn't have a sense of restraint in our programs. The
                    director of CU/AF was Bill Edmondson, who went on to be ambassador in South
                    Africa, and Owen Roberts was the deputy, who also became ambassador in AF. We
                    had a commitment to showing the American society for what it was, and not trying
                    to just show its best face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just curious about how some of these things are set up.
                        Were you more or less just managing or would you sit around on these long
                        lunches and look up at the ceiling and say, you know, I was reading in the
                        paper and they've got something going on in Montana or something. I
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: There was certain repetitiousness to the work, but we would brainstorm
                    who we might try to get to do a tour of Africa. Most of the creativity and
                    programming concepts, however, came from the field. They would ask for someone
                    to talk about a free press or journalism, someone who had experience at the
                    national level and we would then try to find somebody that fit that bill. We had
                    a range of resources to tap into; associations and organizations that worked in
                    those fields and they'd see if they could identify somebody who would be willing
                    to make such a trip. We also ran the Fulbright program, sending American
                    professors for a full academic year in Africa. We put a lot of effort to explain
                    the problems they would confront during their year in Africa. I think this was
                    one of the reasons Richardson wanted more Foreign Service officers in CU to give
                    a flavor for the foreign environment. There were several of fairly well-known
                    universities in Africa like Makerere University in Uganda and Cape Coast College
                    in Ghana. There were then very credible institutions. In Ethiopia there was the
                    Haile Selassie University. We wanted to maintain and expand these relationships
                    with these universities. Regrettably, most of those institutions have fallen
                    into decline. Cape Coast College is still functioning but Makrere was closed for
                    many years as was Haile Selassie in Addis, which became a national university
                    and a hot bed of radicals. Ironically these relationships, which we hoped would
                    bring a degree of political stability and economic improvement didn't occur. It
                    was unfortunate, but I think again, our heads were in the right place in trying
                    to establish those relationships.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, well, when the tour was winding down, we prevailed on our
                    Assistant Secretary, John Richardson, to try to get us decent onward
                    assignments. They did put a word in for me to serve again in AF, but once again
                    I was deflected and I ended up going to Caribbean Affairs. I was to take over
                    the desk for Haiti and the Bahamas. The concept was sold to me, as “Well, it's
                    very much like Africa.” Well, it isn't like Africa at all, and that was the
                    first thing that I learned about it. I accepted the assignment as it was at
                    least a desk officer position. This was in the days of Nixon, I was there in '73
                    to '74 and this influenced our policy in the region. I was given these two
                    portfolios and they were both pretty active. First, the Bahamas was scheduled to
                    become independent on July 1st, 1973 and I arrived in the midst of the
                    preparations. Haiti was a constant headache for us from a variety of reasons. It
                    was an interesting job. It was very dynamic; no more long lunches. One thing you
                    could say about Caribbean Affairs; there are no specialists in Caribbean region.
                    It's an office staffed by officers who are passing through to some other area.
                    In many cases Latin America, but not exclusively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sort of an in-between assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly. A collection of cats and dogs. In ARA/CAR there were the
                    former Spanish-speaking colonies, the English-speaking former colonies, the
                    French-speaking, and even the Dutch-speaking. So there was no linguistic
                    specialization to serve in the office. Likewise, we had an eclectic group of
                    people on the desk as well. John Burke was the office director, later to become
                    the ambassador in Guyana. Unfortunately for him, it was at the time the
                    Jonestown mass suicide, and that was the end of his career. He was a very
                    intense, serious individual, and he took all the responsibility very seriously
                    as well. This was a challenge given all the insane issues that we had to deal
                    with. The second thing about the Caribbean was its proximity to the United
                    States which changed everything. Not only does it change the menu of issues, but
                    just by its proximity to the U.S. changes attitudes of the government. There was
                    continuing reference to the Bahamas being only 50 miles from Florida. Bimini is
                    the closest island. So, issues like law of the sea and Soviet submarine
                    activities in that area were considered important. The flip side was that all
                    the elements of American society at one time or another seemed to have a
                    presence or an interest in the Caribbean. Organized crime was active there;
                    Robert Vesco, the fugitive financier pitched up in the Bahamas. Howard Hughes
                    had three floors of a hotel on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. There were all
                    manner of money laundering activities, and there was narcotics smuggling. There
                    was a flow of illegal immigrants and refugees arriving from that region. All
                    these activities loomed much larger because of the region's proximity to the
                    U.S. U.S. programs and policies were much more intensive than almost anything we
                    were doing in Africa. We had to adjust to that reality, and we used the
                    proximity rational to engender support for our efforts in the Caribbean.</p>

                <p>At the time I was on the Haiti desk, Baby Doc was running the president and was
                    all of 23 years of age. He was a totally incompetent and not really in control
                    of what was going on. His mother, Papa Doc's widow, retained a great deal of
                    influence and ruled the country along with the Minister of Interior. They were
                    the power behind the throne if you will, and they were completely unscrupulous,
                    as you can imagine. We had a lot of economic dealings with Haiti because they
                    did a lot of assembly work for the U.S. market. They do a lot of clothing
                    piecework. Virtually all the baseballs used in the United States are sewn in
                    Haiti. Tourism was an important source of revenue. There was constant political
                    instability of a government that really didn't know what it was doing. While the
                    Tonton Macoutes had largely been suppressed, they had not gone away. Yet they
                    posed no real opposition to the Duvalier rule during this time, but there were
                    issues and situations that would make for an interesting tour. Just one was the
                    immigration issue. There was an unending wave of boatloads of Haitians pitching
                    up on Florida beaches. If they did not make it to Florida, when they spotted a
                    Coast Guard cutter or any boat, they would stove in the bottom of their boat and
                    then start screaming in distress. There would often be 50+ people on a 26-foot
                    boat. Maritime law requires a vessel to rescue those people in peril of death,
                    and land them on the first landfall and, of course, that would be Florida. They
                    would be rounded up and take to the INS court for an exclusionary hearing. The
                    court would formally exclude them despite their claims that they were political
                    refugees fleeing persecution if they were sent back. In reality, they were
                    economic refugees, but they had been coached to make the claim. There were
                    Haitian organizations in Florida which would send an attorney to the INS court.
                    They would ask for a 30-day continuance and in that 30, days they would all
                    disappear into American society. We estimated in the early 70s that there were
                    250,000 illegal Haitians in greater New York area alone. They had their own
                    radio stations, their own newspapers, and their own soccer leagues. Virtually
                    all Haitians in the U.S. were illegals. They all claimed to be political exiles,
                    but they were just peasants or small businessmen. Remarkably, there was a great
                    debate as to why the U.S. was so hard on Haitian refugees as opposed to the
                    Cuban refugees. The allegation was that Cubans are white, and Haitians are
                    blacks. It is nowhere near that simple, needless to say. We identified Castro
                    and his regime as a communist regime, and the law gave them the possibility to
                    be considered refugees, whereas there was no such provision for the
                    Haitians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there also the domestic political pressure
                        exception, I mean you just didn't mess with the Cubans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely, no question of that. In response to our critics we would
                    make that case. I mean these people were fleeing a communist dictatorship
                    whereas Baby Doc was considered a benign bumbler, as opposed to a repressive
                    dictator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they have their Tonton Macoutes</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: These thugs were somewhat subdued by this time, but they were still
                    there. The stories in the files were just spectacular about things that Papa Doc
                    had done in his heyday. He was not only a ruthless individual, but he personally
                    he murdered people with great abandon. His son didn't have those tendencies. His
                    son was a fat, not very bright individual who just liked to live the good life
                    and he was glad to be able to do that. He sort of presided, but did not control
                    things. There were also a lot of commercial disputes with Haiti. Haitians would
                    fail to pay U.S. companies for goods or services, or they would expropriate
                    American firms. The aggrieved Americans would come to the Department to try to
                    make their complaint into a sovereign claim against the government of Haiti. We
                    would dodge and weave and try to avoid accepting the claims because the American
                    firms were often pretty sleazy. One example was Hemo Caribbean which bought for
                    $4 a pint, and sold it in the U.S. for $12 to $15 a pint.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>In another instance, I was awakened about 3:00 in the morning by the OP Center
                    which said that they had just received a flash message from the American
                    ambassador in Port Au Prince that there was a fire at the presidential palace in
                    Port Au Prince. The Haitian president had asked the Ambassador for American fire
                    fighters and fire engines to fly to Haiti to put out the fire for him. So, I
                    went into the OP Center and we started looking at the issue. Sure enough, a fire
                    had started in the palace basement about midnight. This proved to be a classic
                    third world scenario. As it turns out, the fire started in the magazine in the
                    armory which located under the palace, and the president, being paranoid,
                    probably with good reason, had most of the ammunition stored in the presidential
                    basement to keep it out of the hands of his. As the fire progressed, the
                    ammunition started firing off. There was the gunfire all over the capital. The
                    militia who were supposed to defend the president, at least in theory, heard
                    this and grabbed their empty weapons and went racing to the presidential palace
                    to see what was going on. Their expectation was that somebody has risen up
                    against the president and there would be looting the palace, and they wanted to
                    get in on it. So, when they arrived there and they found out that it was just a
                    fire and not a coup, they immediately they turned around and claimed they had
                    come to protect the president. The fire burned on through the night and our
                    Ambassador is contacted by the Haitians to send firefighters and equipment. The
                    Joint Chiefs Office said it could get fire fighting teams Port au Prince, but
                    not in any useful time frame. We told the ambassador help could not arrive in
                    time. The fire meanwhile is burning itself out. It pretty much burned the palace
                    down, and, in the process, it destroyed all the ammunition in the armory. That
                    morning at about 9:00, the president went on the radio to reassure his people,
                    saying to his people, “Your beloved president and his family are well. There was
                    a fire and it's now under control, and there's no longer any need for concern.”
                    He explained that the explosions they heard was the ammunition stored at the
                    palace, and now all the ammunition was expended, and there is no further danger.
                    He thought. My God, I've just told the whole world I have no ammunition to
                    defend the regime. Haitian exiles were based throughout the region, the
                    Dominican Republic and Cuba and parts of the United States. And here Baby Doc
                    has just signaled them he has no munitions. He thinks about this for about an
                    hour, and we get another flash message from the embassy with a preliminary list
                    of the munitions that Haiti will need. They wanted four million rounds of small
                    arms ammunition; they wanted mortar rounds, grenades and all many of other
                    munitions. So, we take a look at this list, and I think to myself, wow, this
                    gives us incredible leverage with this guy. I then got a call from the Joint
                    Chief's office which had also gotten this flash message. They had started to
                    staff this problem, and OJC figures DOD can get these munitions together and
                    have them down there in 36 hours. I said, not so fast. First of all, this is
                    Baby Doc. Second of all, if the Haitians want something from us, we should be
                    getting something from them. So, I went to the office director about this idea.
                    He had come to the Office of Caribbean Affairs from having been the DCM in Port
                    Au Prince, and he knew the scene pretty well. I said this looks like an
                    excellent opportunity. We had about nine or ten major issues with Haiti we
                    wanted to resolve. I said, “Why don't we start going through our list of what we
                    want before we give them these weapons?” He said, oh, no. He didn't think that
                    was the right thing to do. I thought that this was the essence of diplomacy;
                    you've got something that they want, so let's get something in return. No, no,
                    he said, we can't do that. He said, “We have a security interest in seeing to it
                    that the situation in Haiti remains stable.” We had concerns about the Dominican
                    Republic, which had been in turmoil in the mid-'60s, and where the Cubans were
                    looking for an opportunity to move in, so we couldn't chance such instability.
                    We therefore have an interest in sending these weapons. He simply would not
                    consider a quid pro quo. Sure enough, DOD, in a fullness of time, starting
                    within a week to provide some small arms ammunition, and Baby Doc was back on
                    top. The exiles were so disorganized that they couldn't take advantage of this
                    opportunity. It showed you the kind of the wit that this president had to even
                    get himself in that situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>This proved the first test that raised the Director's concern as to whether I was
                    qualified to be Haiti desk officer. The second, and the defining one, was my
                    dealing with a Haitian request to buy four Cadillac Gage armored cars. They were
                    $900,000 apiece, and the export control office had sent us an application for
                    our determination. I thought, Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western
                    hemisphere; the last thing in the world they need was to buy these million
                    dollar armored cars. The Haitians said, “You needn't worry, because we're not
                    buying the weaponry for them.” These machines had six massive tires and they
                    carried out six or eight machine guns, but we are not asking us to sell them the
                    machine guns. The Belgians would take care of that. The Cadillac Gage people
                    came in and explained that this was a fine deal. I had the presence of mind go
                    back and to research a military survey done by the Untied States army about two
                    years before. This report said explicitly the United States should not provide
                    armored vehicles to Haiti. Haiti is about 90% mountainous and armored vehicles
                    have no beneficial use in terms of counter insurgency, but would be used to
                    suppress their own people, which is exactly what Baby Doc wanted. I presented my
                    case to the office director showing him these passages from the military survey.
                    It that point, he didn't have much choice but to agree. He grumbled, but we
                    turned down the application for four armored cars. About four or five weeks
                    later the Haitian military attach�, a brigadier general, came to the office and
                    met with the deputy office director, George High. The General wanted to resubmit
                    a new application, this time for six armored cars. I noticed he was wearing a
                    gold armored car tie clip. Inevitably, he was in the league with the supplier; I
                    could only speculate what the arrangement might have been. In any event, he
                    wanted to go to a higher level to make this application and make his appeal. Now
                    the general claimed that four of the armored cars were for the presidential
                    guard, and two for a battalion called the Leopards. This was a special reaction
                    force that was beloved by the Duvaliers. Haiti put forward this application, and
                    this time it went to the office director, the former DCM. He decides that this
                    request makes good sense. The Haitians would have four with the Presidential
                    Guard and two with the Leopards, and they would offset each other thereby
                    providing the right balance. He said he thought we ought to go approve. I said,
                    this doesn't change what the military survey said. Armored cars are not what we
                    ought to be selling to these people. He replied, you have to understand that the
                    “mature relationship” with Latin America that Nixon had announced has permitted
                    the sale of Phantom jets to Peru or Columbia. This was the new mature
                    relationship, which essentially meant that if you could afford to buy a weapon,
                    we'd sell it to you, all except the current first line of weapons. Therefore,
                    under this mature relationship, we should sell these six armored cars to the
                    Haitians. I thought this was outrageous. The next thing I know, the director
                    decided to rearrange my portfolio of responsibilities. It was an issue as to my
                    maturity to handle an account as complicated as Haiti. I was now given the
                    Bahamas and Netherlands Antilles and the French West Indies. The Bahamas was
                    interesting; the other two were of minor significance at this time. So much for
                    my understanding of the mature relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Bahamas. I mean, basically the
                        Bahamas, it was all geography, wasn't it, the fact where they were and being
                        off to one, I mean as you say, people were using it for a multiplicity of
                        purposes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. The Bahamas is a very interesting place in a lot of ways.
                    It's a chain of 700 islands where life is good and the inhabitants all seem to
                    live and work remarkably well together. The British had something of a prize in
                    that part of the world. They had agreed with the local leaders that they would
                    move toward independence. Lyndon Pindling, who was the head of government, had
                    been in local politics for some time under the semi-autonomist political
                    arrangement that existed. He seemed to be an upright individual. Given the
                    Bahamas' proximity to the United States, was like the United States in many
                    ways. A number of Bahamians, including government leaders, served in the
                    American military, and many of the elites had been educated in the United States
                    and had worked in the United States. They were very close to us in their
                    political orientation and they weren't much given to the radical approach.
                    Tourism attracted tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans, as well as
                    Canadians and Europeans. On Paradise Island which is the second most populace
                    island was the center of the tourism trade, and especially of gambling. When
                    there's gambling, there's almost always organized crime and sure enough the
                    American organized crime was represented there. We had an extensive array of
                    connections with the Bahamas, which were important enough that the U.S. couldn't
                    ignore them. Bebe Rebozo, a close friend of Richard Nixon, had a place in the
                    Bahamas which the president had visited many times including while he was
                    president.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Bebe Rebozo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the confidant of Richard Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: He well may have been. I think he made his money in real estate in
                    southern California, and yes, they were great buddies. So, we felt that when the
                    new Bahamian ambassador, who was named L. B. Johnson and known as LBJ, went to
                    the White House to present his credentials, that he would get more time with
                    Nixon because he had spent some time in his country. He got no more than anybody
                    else. He came in with eight other ambassadors and was whisked through with a
                    brief photo op, an exchange of letters and boom, off he went. In any event, we
                    were soon disabused of how benign the situation was there, as it turned out that
                    Lyndon Pindling was on the take, and he was protecting Robert Vesco stole some
                    $250,000,000 from shareholders of Overseas Investors Services which in those
                    days was a lot of money. Vesco quietly had taken up residence in Grand
                    Bahama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was wanted in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He was wanted in the United States. Among other things, the U.S.
                    government wanted to get Vesco for securities fraud as he had bilked thousands
                    out of their life savings. The SEC in particular really wanted to take action
                    against Vesco. I worked with the general counsel of the SEC, Stanley Sporkin,
                    who was determined to try to find a way to get Vesco. He was successful in
                    seizing the assets of Vesco's, which are not only his accounts that they could
                    identify, but also his other assets. He owned several planes and several yachts
                    among other assets. The SEC set up operations to seize these yachts by sending
                    agents aboard as crew members and when they set out to sea, they'd take over the
                    yacht in the name of the United States government, sail it to the United States
                    and sell it. We heard that Vesco became so paranoid that when he flew on his own
                    plane, he had an armed bodyguard who was knowledgeable of aviation, armed with
                    navigational maps, sit next to the pilot to be sure he was going to the proper
                    destination places. Vesco was concerned that his pilot might be have been
                    co-opted by the Department of Justice to bring Vesco to the United States. So,
                    the government had gotten under his skin at least to that extent. In any event,
                    Justice finally developed a case to extradite Vesco to the United States for
                    wire fraud. The Bahamian government cooperated to the extent that Vesco was
                    served with a subpoena, but as the Bahamas had just become independent, and it
                    had to figure out which extradition law would apply. They decided to use the
                    British extradition treaty, which had a wire fraud provision. We were advised
                    that to pursue an extradition case in the Bahamas you had to be represented by a
                    queen's counsel which is a senior attorney versed in commonwealth law It turned
                    out that there were only two queen's counsels in the Bahamas and Vesco had hired
                    them both. He tied them up before Justice could figure out what was going on.
                    The Justice Department finally arranged to hire a queen's counsel, but he was
                    from Uganda. We were pretty skeptical from the outset as the U.S. had a Ugandan
                    queen's counsel pursuing an extradition case for the United States against a guy
                    who is deeply entrenched in the Bahamas. Vesco was obviously spreading money
                    around, and we wondered, what were our chances? We pursued the extradition, but
                    I must say, I had a sense that is effort was as much for the record, for
                    appearances sake, as anything else. I had a strong sense that the Nixon
                    administration did not want to bring Robert Vesco back to the U.S.; they just
                    wanted him to go away. While the SEC seemed to be quite serious about getting
                    Vesco, Justice always seemed to be a day late and a dollar short in the pursuit
                    of Robert Vesco. Predictably, the Ugandan queen's counsel was whipsawed by the
                    locals who knew all of the officials around the courthouse. The final decision
                    was that the 1937 extradition agreement provisions on wire fraud did not
                    encompass the crime with which Vesco was charged. . It had not been defined in
                    1937. Our extradition request was dismissed. As part of this exercise, under
                    pressure from the U.S. the Bahamian government summoned him to come down to the
                    police station to be photograph and possibly fingerprinted. He was then he was
                    released on bond and he returned to his compound. He apparently thought he had
                    bought the government so completely that he would never even be pulled into the
                    police station. So, he was very annoyed. As soon as his extradition proceedings
                    were completed, he flew out of Bahamas and ended up in after that. He was no
                    longer our problem. The Desk was involved in transmitting much of the supporting
                    information for the extradition, but the strategizing was all Justice. Vesco
                    flew the coop and that was that. The SEC general counsel, Stanley Sporkin, later
                    became the general counsel at the CIA, having gone there with SEC Director
                    William Casey, the Reagan friend, and he's later became a federal judge on the
                    DC bench. Ironically, Sporkin was presiding over the women's class action suit
                    against the Department, and seemed to rule against us at every opportunity. The
                    word was that he did so because in his days at the CIA, State blocked a number
                    of Casey's more bizarre initiatives. I must say, Sporkin struck me as being a
                    very serious individual, and he knew a hell of a lot about Vesco and he was
                    genuinely intent on getting Vesco, and I always wondered what he thought about
                    how Justice pursued that extradition.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Another thing that we used to get involved in was fisheries issues because of the
                    proximity, the number of islands and the length of the Archipelago. Inevitably,
                    there were conflicts between American fishermen and Bahamian fisheries
                    enforcement. We would get cases where an American flag vessel would go into
                    Bahamian waters and they would poach lobster in particular; the Caribbean
                    lobster, which is mostly tail.</p>
                <p>So, in any event we were involved in he fishery issues. Most of the American
                    fishermen involved were Cuban exiles who had fled to the United States claiming
                    to be political exiles. They then bought fishing boats, had them registered as
                    American flag vessels, and then went back to poaching the same waters they had
                    when they fished out of Cuba. The Bahamians were at a great disadvantage because
                    of the size of their fisheries zone, and they had only six enforcement vessels,
                    of which only half were operational at any given time. The U.S. Coast Guard
                    would contact us about issues of hot pursuit of American flag poachers, seeking
                    guidance. One evening I was preparing dinner and I got a phone call and it was
                    the State operations center. The operations center was patched to some Coast
                    Guard people in Norfolk, and from Norfolk they were talking to a commander of an
                    American Coast Guard cutter. The captain described the situation, “There is an
                    American flag fishing vessel that is being pursued by a Bahamian enforcement
                    vessel, which is firing across its bow. The U.S. flag boat is not heaving to,
                    and our coast guard vessel and the other two boats are in international waters.
                    But the Bahamian and the U.S. flag vessels just left the Bahamian exclusive
                    fishery zone in hot pursuit. What should we do? Should we interpose ourselves or
                    should we fire a warning shot across the Bahamian's bow or show we not
                    intervene?” I knew this conversation was being recorded because you could hear
                    the beep every 15 seconds. Remember the Simas Kudirka case where the guy and the
                    captain...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Lithuanian who had escaped and the coast guard
                        had put him back.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He actually made it to a coast guard vessel and the coast guard captain
                    allowed the Soviets to come aboard, beat him senseless and drag him back to
                    their ship. The captain claimed he was in contact with the State Department. He
                    claimed that the State Department gave him conflicting and unhelpful advice. So
                    from that day forward the coast guard recorded every conversation they had with
                    the Department of State. So, hearing this beep I thought to myself, I am not
                    going to fall into this trap. I said to the captain, “Okay, let's review the
                    situation. You outlined the situation as follows. Am I correct in my
                    understanding of it?” He said, “That's correct.” I said, “What do your standard
                    operating procedures tell you to do under these circumstances?” He said, “Well,
                    I should intervene between the two vessels.” I said, “Is there any circumstance
                    that I should be aware of that would have you deviate from this standard
                    operating procedure?” He said, “No, there wasn't.” I said, “Well, I would
                    suggest you follow your standard operating procedure.” Well, as it turned out,
                    the American vessel outran the Bahamian enforcement vessel and it didn't come to
                    any confrontation per se, but I was pursued that this was one of those
                    situations that I just didn't want to freelance. So, I put the burden back on
                    the person on the scene, which is the way it ought to be in any event. These
                    incidents continued, and there was some effort to control the Cubans exiles, but
                    once again their exiled community felt that that was an obstacle to their
                    economic opportunity. The Bahamians were being badly used simply because they
                    couldn't possibly control their own fishery zone. It was not traditional
                    American fishermen. It had been mostly these Cuban poachers who had been doing
                    this before. So this situation kept us on our toes.</p>
                <p>Another event that was indicative of how The Bahamas was different from other
                    nations was the celebration of the Bahamian independence. Immediately there was
                    an issue about U.S. representation at the event, which shows the differences
                    about how our relations with countries that are close by versus those that are
                    more distance. There was a group that called itself the Friends of the Bahamas,
                    which was a group of Americans, who were very senior, prominent people. The two
                    central players in this were Congressman Pogue, or Chairman Pogue of the House
                    Agricultural Committee and Congressman Flood of the House Arms Services
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Pennsylvania.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: From Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Prior to independence, they had
                    engineered an AID project as an acknowledgment of an independent government.
                    They decided that there should be a $10 million beef cattle project on Andros
                    Island, which is the largest island in the Bahamas. This was a $10 million
                    project. I thought a cattle project on Andros Island for $10 million; when I was
                    in Chad we were trying to get about $150,000 to have water well points to bring
                    the cattle into the capital to the Fort Lamy. We couldn't get $150,000 and
                    here's the Bahamas that has no history of beef cattle production of any sort. We
                    looked into it because there no cattle activity or any animal husbandry
                    experience. Why Andros Island? Well, just because it's big, and it should be
                    able to offer good pastures. When they examined the soils, however, they found
                    that there was an overlaying volcanic crust that couldn't be broken with a
                    tractor or a plow. You had to bulldoze it to crack this crust and to pulverize
                    it sufficiently to make it into pasture. I mean the whole undertaking was an
                    absolute boondoggle. When the $10 million was examined carefully, it did not
                    make any sense. When Prime Minister Lyndon Pindling looked at this project, he
                    said, “Well, this is great; $10 million. When do I get the check?” The answer
                    is, well, it doesn't quite work that way. It turned out that the Congressman
                    Pogue represented the district in Texas where the Western Institute of Science
                    and Technology, WIST, was located. The other half of the project was given to
                    Penn State Wilkes-Barre which Congressman Flood represented. So, the $10 million
                    was split between the two congressional districts. So when they went to the
                    Bahamas for independence, they insisted that that they put on a big show for
                    their friends in the Friends of Bahamas group. I think Nixon's friend Bebe
                    Rebozo was involved in that as well. Congressman Flood was one of the old barons
                    in the House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a magnificent mustache.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. Of course, he fell on hard times eventually, but he was in
                    his heyday at this point. So, he said, I want to take these friends down to the
                    Bahamas. He said to the Department of Defense, specifically, the U.S. Army, “I
                    want six helicopters to ferry my people around to the various events for
                    independence.” Just like that, the army said no problem. We'll have six
                    helicopters for you and support services. When we learned that Flood wanted six
                    helicopters we were appalled. The ranking dignitary at the independence
                    celebration was Prince Charles who was conferring independence on the Bahamian
                    people in the name of his mother, the Queen. We asked, “What's the Prince's
                    entourage?” The Brits said, “It's modest, but he's got a helicopter.” There was
                    no way we were going to agree that Flood have six helicopters. So, we went back
                    to DOD and said you cannot provide Flood six helicopters. DOD said, “We're not
                    going to tell him no. If you want to tell him no, you go ahead and tell him.” So
                    we did. I went to Flood's people and said, “You cannot upstage Prince Charles.
                    That is simply not acceptable. It will be a major gaff.” I dealt with an
                    assistant named Steve Elko; what a bandit he was. They fought and fought and
                    fought, but eventually they lost. The Department prevailed on the issue and he
                    went to Nassau with no helicopters, but he did get the royal treatment
                    nonetheless. In any event, Steve Elko later went to jail for influence peddling,
                    manipulation, extortion, etc., when Flood lost his seat. I remember he was
                    brought to trial for illegal activity, he was considered to be non compos
                    mentis. He was too senile. He sat as chairman of his committee up until a few
                    months before he went on trial and he was determined to be incompetent to stand
                    trial. Regarding the Andros project, to my knowledge there are still no cattle
                    on Andros Island today. It was a non-starter, but it was a way in which these
                    two Congressmen could channel money to their congressional districts, which they
                    successfully did.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, you know, it just was that kind of a situation with the Bahamas;
                    everything seemed to have a different cast to it by virtue of the proximity to
                    the U.S. You could make an argument for support of the Bahamas that you couldn't
                    make for other nations or regions because of our security concerns. I think that
                    security was the underlying consideration. If we don't provide them what they
                    need, it could create problems for the U.S. The other countries I worked on were
                    Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles. Surinam was going through continuing
                    turmoil, and our principal interest there was the massive Alcoa bauxite
                    operation there. We were able to work well with those two nations without major
                    problems. In Surinam, there were always conflicts among the various ethnic
                    groups; the Indians, the indigenous peoples, the Malay population. Thank God,
                    during the time I was responsible nothing went awry. The Netherlands Antilles
                    was involved in a situation that gave some insight into how Washington works.
                    The Congress had written and passed legislation providing certain tax benefits
                    for offshore companies including those based in the Netherlands Antilles. The
                    Netherlands Antilles earned about $125 million a year, from registration fees
                    for these offshore companies. The Netherlands Antilles was important to us
                    because there were two massive refineries located there; a Shell refinery in
                    Curacao and a big Texaco refinery in Aruba. Almost two million barrels of oil a
                    day destined for the United States came through those two refineries. So we had
                    some legitimate security concerns. There was an in-house radical group that not
                    only advocated breaking ties with the Netherlands, but also hinted that it
                    wanted to shut down these refineries. It was rumored that there was some
                    communist influence, and money from them was being channeled to their leader. In
                    fact, I think he was pretty tame when you got right down to it. There was a
                    constant watch on that situation. The U.S. had a very sweet operation there.
                    We'd been given the site for our consulate general on the hillside looking over
                    to the south over Willemstad on Curacao in return for our Marshall Plan
                    assistance to the Netherlands following the war. We had a little consul general
                    with five Americans. It was a real plum to be the CG in Curacao. In any event,
                    they sent a delegation to the Untied States to ensure the extension of this
                    legislation benefiting these large American corporations with offshore
                    operations. Their concern was the $125 million in fees they received annually.
                    We were inclined to help them make their case because it was a significant
                    revenue earner for the Netherlands Antilles. Again, because of their proximity
                    to the U.S. we learned that they had hired a group of lobbyists who succeeded in
                    arranging high-level appointments. We tried to get appointments for them, and
                    the best we could do was at a fairly low level. The next thing we knew they had
                    Treasury Secretary Simon lined up to meet with their president. There were six
                    islands under the Dutch union, and they were all theoretically equal partners.
                    But they were not completely autonomous, nor did they really want to be because
                    then they would lose all of the benefits from their connection to Holland. So,
                    the presidential delegation arrived and we went through that process. It turns
                    out that this was a critical time in the Nixon Watergate scandal. Nixon was now
                    in very deep trouble. The tapes had been turned over, and the contents were
                    being revealed. The committee was moving towards impeachment. The key lobbyist
                    was a fellow name Mullins, who was an attorney. His partner was named
                    Silverstein who had worked for the Department of Treasury and, surprise,
                    surprise, he wrote the legislation that the Netherlands Antilles, as well as
                    other offshore nations, benefited from. Having written and helped pass the
                    legislation, I assumed by a Republican Congress, he resigned from Treasury, and
                    obtained employment by interpreting the act for interested companies. He
                    apparently thought, here I am earning $50,000 or $60,000 a year as a deputy
                    assistant secretary, where I could be in the private sector and answer questions
                    about it for real bucks. Mullins hosted this delegation at his spectacular home
                    in Northwest Washington. It had an indoor pool, a waterfall, and a lighted and
                    manicured garden. That very night we sat around the TV with the president of the
                    Netherlands Antilles and his senior ministers and learned that Nixon would
                    resign. Everybody was shaking their hand. It struck me that these people were
                    very sympathetic to Nixon. They commented that what Nixon did wasn't so bad;
                    that he had just got caught in a situation. Why are Americans taking this so
                    terribly seriously? They had a strong sense that office should be respected. The
                    whole Watergate exercise was demoralizing, and the involvement with the
                    Netherlands Antilles was humiliating. I was becoming very discontent. After I
                    had been moved off the Haiti desk and I wasn't really sure whether this career
                    was for me. At that juncture I went to talk to my CDO and said to him....</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Career.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Career Development Officer, right, in Personnel. I said to him that I
                    would like to go on leave without pay for a period of about a year. I was then
                    about 15 months into my assignment in ARA/CAR, and from a personnel perspective,
                    that's the first issue; how do they fill a job that is off-cycle. I said, be
                    that as it may, I wanted to do this. So, the CDO hemmed and hawed, and said he
                    would look into it; someone will get back in touch with you. Well, he got back
                    in touch, and he didn't know if that was going to be possible. He said it was
                    going to be very difficult for PER for various reasons. I said, I really was
                    quite intent about doing this. I was very disappointed about how this whole
                    foreign policy process worked. I was shocked at how the Nixon White House had
                    conducted itself, and particularly the use of agencies of the executive branch
                    against its enemies. I thought, Jesus, I don't know if I want to be associated
                    with this process any longer. Also, I realized that my last two assignments were
                    jobs that I hadn't really sought, and they hadn't been very productive for my
                    career objective of working in Africa. So, the CDO and I went back and forth. He
                    dragged this out, as I had started this exercise in August. In October I finally
                    went to the CDO and said to him, “Look, you have got to tell me how I can go on
                    leave without pay, and then get it done within two weeks time.” He said, “Well,
                    I've looked into this and there's just no real way you can do it. You can
                    resign.” I said, “Okay, how do I resign?” He said, “Well, you write a letter to
                    the Secretary and you tell them that you had a great career and you really
                    enjoyed it; however, these circumstances have arisen and you don't want to serve
                    any longer.” So, I thought, screw it, I'll do it. So, I went home and I drafted
                    this resignation letter very carefully. I did have the good counsel of a friend
                    of mine who had gone through a similar situation. He said to incorporate in the
                    letter the fact that I had asked for leave without pay, but it wasn't granted. I
                    thought that was fairly clever. As it turned out, as I found out later, even
                    resignations have to be paneled, and when they come up in the IF panel, they
                    usually ask, why is this person resigning. So, I figured, what the hell, I'd
                    give it a shot. So, I wrote the letter over the weekend and presented it on
                    Monday morning. I dropped it on the CDO's desk only to find out that he had gone
                    off on two weeks leave, so he left me twisting in the wind for two more weeks.
                    He came back and I finally got hold of him. I asked, “What do you think?” He
                    said, “Well, what I'm going to do is to grant you 90 days leave without pay on
                    my own authority.” I said, “That's interesting, but 90 days is not enough. I
                    want more than that.” He said, “But you don't have a proposal that is career
                    enhancing. Let's just say, you're going to go to law school or somewhere that
                    will enhance your attractiveness to the Foreign Service.” I said, “Well, I'm
                    sorry, but that's not how it is.” He said, “I'll see what I can do.” Sure
                    enough, I went off on leave without pay and he finally came through. They did
                    panel me for LWOP, giving me an extra six months, a total of nine months. I went
                    out to Loudoun County to live in Middleburg, Virginia. I found a place to rent
                    and I moved out of my apartment in Columbia Plaza, and I started doing things I
                    always wanted to do. I learned how to fly. I worked for a community hotline up
                    in Leesburg. I set up the Loudoun branch of Common Cause. I had been an active
                    member and figured I'd try to extend it to Loudoun. I had also wanted to write
                    about my political beliefs. I started doing some writing and found it much more
                    difficult than I thought it would be, and requiring more discipline than I was
                    prepared to devote. I owned the land in northern Loudoun north of Waterford. So
                    I could go up there from time to time and work on clearing the land. I had a
                    good old time, but it didn't turn out to be as productive as I hoped. So I just
                    sort of rusticated, if you will, for about nine months. While I was rusticating,
                    all of a sudden I became a hot property. One of the reasons I believe that I was
                    not just bounced out of the Foreign Service was that there was a deficit of
                    FSO-5 political officers. They apparently just didn't want to have to admit that
                    they couldn't hang on to me. If it took him a year to get his head clear, well,
                    okay, let's see if we can't let it happen. I had a friend who tried the same
                    routine with USIA, and they let him go. I guess I just hit it right. In any
                    event, I now started to get job offers; four of them. One was from the
                    ambassador in the Bahamas for whom I'd been the desk officer. He called and said
                    he wanted me for his political officer. It was a great job, but it was out of
                    the area that I want to serve in. I turned him down. I got another job offer
                    from out of the blue, and Personnel asked if I was going to be back in the
                    assignment cycle. I said, I guess I would. So, I put in a bid list and gee, I
                    got two different job offers as part of that process. I thought this never
                    happened when I was on regular duty, why was this all happening now? The one job
                    that was most appealing, went through the standard bid process was the deputy
                    principal officer in Asmara, Ethiopia. That's where I ended up going. It was an
                    area in conflict, but I felt that could be an interesting place.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out there in '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I did, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, this is probably a good place to stop. One question
                        though about the Bahamas, how about drugs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was a concern. On the surface, most of the activity was marijuana
                    from Jamaica to Florida. People would go to Jamaica and buy a load of marijuana
                    and then charter an aircraft. They would attempt to fly to some little field in
                    Florida. Oftentimes they weren't that experienced pilots. They would crash in
                    the Bahamas or they'd crash at sea. Suffice it to say, after awhile, aircraft
                    owners in most of the Caribbean would not charter aircraft to people they had
                    any suspicion about. In terms of hard narcotics, there were reports of such
                    traffic, but no major seizures. We worked with DEA on this. In the Bahamas we
                    had a pre-clearance facility which was both U.S. customs and immigration
                    service. If you visited Nassau, you could be cleared to return to the United
                    States by American immigration and customs officials. That created something of
                    a flap however, because, while it enhanced tourism and tourist revenues for the
                    Bahamian government, they were very concerned, as it turned out, properly, that
                    the U.S. agents would run operations, particularly the customs service, against
                    narcotics. Sure enough, our customs people were discovered doing so and there
                    was a great flap about it. They had tried to suborn a Bahamian law enforcement
                    individual to work on their behalf, and this incident got into the public
                    domain. All countries close to the United States are always afraid of having
                    their officials co-opted by Americans. We were able to persuade them that the
                    pre-clearance facility was beneficial to them and they allowed us to keep it
                    going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was a time I was consul general in Athens at
                        this particular time and it was a time we had an awful lot of Americans
                        taking their year off. These are mostly college students or something
                        wandering around and heading to where there was hashish or marijuana, not
                        hard drugs, was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Less so in the Bahamas. Again Jamaica was the place for these folks to
                    visit. There was a difference between Bahamians and other Caribbean islanders,
                    and I particularly saw this with Jamaicans. Bahamians are much more sort of
                    formal, conservative, quiet folks than the Jamaicans. Jamaicans are outgoing and
                    loud. Bahamians never seemed to be that way. They were very decent people. I
                    don't know, they just seemed more British in their approach and less prepared to
                    tolerate drug trafficking. If you went to the major hotels and I'm sure you
                    could get marijuana there without any problem.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Okay, well in the summer of 1974, which was a turbulent time in the
                    U.S. as you'll recall with Nixon under fire for the Watergate, and that was
                    reaching a culminating stage. I was increasingly unhappy with what I was doing
                    in the Caribbean office and eventually went to the point of actually going to my
                    advisor, my CDO and saying to him, I've got to make a move here of some sort. I
                    want to get out of this job in Caribbean affairs.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, a variety of things. I felt that first of all that our policy was
                    wrong. I think that I made reference to the fact about the armored car sales to
                    Haiti which I thought was wrong, for which I was removed from the Haiti desk and
                    was given responsibilities in the French West Indies and the Netherlands
                    Antilles. I felt also that my career was not evolving as I'd hoped. I'd wanted
                    to focus on Africa and I kept getting sidetracked to Cultural Affairs, and now
                    at the Caribbean affairs. The Caribbean, as I think I indicated, was mostly the
                    domain of “Christmas help.” There were no regional specialists in Caribbean
                    affairs. Sure, you had them in Latin America and you had them in other parts of
                    the world, but assignments in Caribbean affairs were just a filler position. I
                    just was very frustrated at that stage. I was also ashamed about how the Nixon
                    administration had conducted itself and wondered whether I wanted to be
                    associated with it. In reality, I felt that if I wanted to make a break and
                    leave the government, the Foreign Service, ideally I would be able to do it from
                    the position of being on leave without pay rather than actually having to
                    resign. I couldn't get my career development officer to focus on my request,
                    that so finally I wrote the letter of resignation to Henry Kissinger. I said in
                    the letter that I've enjoyed the career, but that I regretted the fact that the
                    system couldn't offer me the leave without pay that I had requested. That turned
                    the trick because the CDO did grant me the leave without pay. I left the office
                    ARA/CAR in something of a lurch, but I knew they could find other people who
                    were capable of picking up the responsibility. So, then I went off and rented a
                    place out in Middleburg, Virginia. As I mentioned, I did a variety of things out
                    there. By the spring of '75, I was ready to return to the Department.
                    Remarkably, people began to get in touch with me. Ambassador Weiss in the
                    Bahamas asked if I'd like to be his political officer. Several other options
                    were offered to me. I did want to get back into the African Bureau, so I waited
                    until the right opportunity arose and that was the deputy principal officer
                    position in Asmara which was a consulate general. It was agreed that I would be
                    assigned, and I arrived in July of '75.</p>
                <p>Now, let me set the scene a little bit about what Asmara was like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '75 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I was there from July '75 to April of '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I began studying up on the problems of the area. Haile Selassie had
                    been removed from office, but was still alive, and was under house arrest in the
                    country. The country was being run by a shadowy group of military officers who
                    were making decisions for the government. The Eritrean civil war had been going
                    on since 1959 or '61 depending on how you calculate it, when the Ethiopian
                    government under the emperor betrayed the UN brokered agreement on Eritrea's
                    semi autonomy. Haile Selassie occupied Eritrea and dissolved their local
                    legislature. It started as a very low intensity insurgency, but that had been
                    going on for some 15 years by the time I arrived. In January, 1975 there was
                    what was later known as the uprising, at a point when the military clique that
                    ran the country, the Derg, was at a weak point. Eritreans, including some who
                    were in the military and those who had risen to positions of great
                    responsibility, attempted to seize the capital of Asmara and thereby break the
                    region off from Ethiopia by force. The insurgents, with the collusion with these
                    Eritreans, overran the city and held it for several days. The Derg then sent
                    more troops to Asmara and they eventually drove the rebels out of the city. But
                    the impact on the city was staggering. I say this as preface to my arrival what
                    this city was like. First, there had been a very substantial Italian community
                    in Eritrea in general, and in Asmara, in particular. At its peak under
                    Mussolini, who had encouraged migration there, there had been 135,000 Italians.
                    Prior to this takeover in January of '75 there had been about 15,000 to 20,000
                    Italians still left in Eritrea. But after this uprising, in which there were
                    firefights in every quarter and many buildings were damaged or destroyed. As a
                    result, the Italian population dropped off markedly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because of nationalist impulses and saying get
                        these foreigners out of there? They decided it was a healthy place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: The remarkable thing about the Italian experience in Eritrea, and this
                    addresses the cultural issues and the differences in the way in which colonial
                    experiences vary in Africa. Some Eritreans, and particularly the insurgents,
                    were favorably disposed to the Italians. The Italians had invested in Eritrea,
                    they had businesses there. They ran the brewery, a big textile factory and the
                    Coca-Cola bottling plant, and they had trained Eritreans up to a certain level,
                    mainly technical skills. Yet they had never established a college. It was only
                    after the British administration under the United Nations mandate that they the
                    first university was established. The Eritreans intermarried with the Italians,
                    and they felt the Italians were sympathetic people. They got along with them
                    quite well, so it was not the insurgents' intent to drive them out, but the
                    Italians felt they were in danger of being caught in the middle. After the Derg
                    drove the rebels out of Asmara, the Ethiopians were very harsh in repression and
                    they shut the city down. Asmara became much less a pleasant place to live. For
                    Italians who first colonized Eritrea in the 1890s this had been a sweet
                    existence, I can tell you. There were third-generation Italians there who had
                    lived in Eritrea all their lives. First, you have to remember that at 7,700
                    feet, so the climate is cool, pleasant, and sunny virtually all of the year
                    round. In the rainy season, it rains from about 3:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon,
                    and then that's that. They had these very productive farms, not to say
                    plantations, and they ran all the industrial activity. They played bocce ball
                    and sat around drinking and talking in the afternoons under the big shade trees.
                    Life was very, very nice; not unlike what the British had in Kenya during its
                    heyday. The possibility of being driven out was very difficult for these people
                    to accept. Nonetheless, the Italian population dropped drastically, as they
                    realized that this was probably not a long-term situation that they could hang
                    on to. In any event, when I arrived in July of 1975, the population of the city
                    was down probably by a third from what it had once been. There were whole middle
                    class neighborhoods that were abandoned, including both Italian and matesse
                    communities. All major buildings were pockmarked with bullet holes, and heavily
                    armed guards in sandbagged positions at all the government offices. There were
                    roving patrols and machine gun jeeps throughout the city. Most particularly,
                    there was a rigid curfew. The curfew was from 7:00 at night until 6:00 in the
                    morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's a rough one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was a curfew for which you could have a pass, but it was worth your
                    life to go out because the security forces would open fire on anybody who was
                    out after 7:00. So, everybody had to be in by 6:30 because, being not far from
                    the equator. daylight hours didn't vary very much. We felt it best to be in well
                    before the sunset. We got everybody into our compounds, and every night there
                    was gunfire. Some of it would be just trigger-happy sentinels, or sometimes the
                    insurgents would infiltrate the city. The curfew gave them that opportunity, and
                    with the help of people in the city who were sympathetic to the rebels, they
                    could slip in. They used the opportunity to communicate with their family, raise
                    money, propagandize and then slip back out again. Occasionally they would attack
                    some of the facilities. They'd shoot them up.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Ethiopians still maintaining that these were
                        bandits or shiftas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, that was their basic position that the insurgents were shiftas,
                    and they denied that there was any real political underpinnings. The Derg
                    maintained the fiction that Haile Selassie, now deposed and discredited, in
                    incorporating Eritrea into Ethiopia and disbanding the autonomous legislature
                    had acted in accordance with the will of the people. In reality that wasn't the
                    case. The Eritrean people were very strongly opposed. Even though they agreed on
                    that� that the insurgent groups were themselves split. The ELF was primarily a
                    Muslim group with ties to the more radical Arab states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ELF being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Eritrean Liberation Front. Then later and more importantly there was
                    the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front, the EPLF, which was a Marxist-Leninist,
                    largely Christian group with some Muslims. It was more disciplined and it became
                    the more powerful and more coherent of the two groups. But both of them were
                    significant political organizations and had a structure and a leadership
                    hierarchy. They were not people to be taken lightly. They had some successes in
                    the countryside even after the failed January attempt to take over Asmara. They
                    had excellent intelligence and they knew virtually everything the Ethiopians
                    did. They made a point of taking actions that would tend to demoralize the
                    Ethiopian garrison. For example, they blew up the Coca-Cola factory shortly
                    after I arrived. There was great consternation over that in the expat community,
                    no soft drinks and no mixers for their gin and tonics. Also, the rebels had
                    factory owners they liked and the ones they didn't like. So, they tended to
                    target the former.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>I arrived in this situation in July 1975 the city very tense and the people
                    feeling oppressed by the very tight security. In addition to the curfew, you
                    could not travel out of the city. There were roadblocks on every egress. These
                    rules applied even to consular corps officials. So, we would host these kabuki
                    theater-like lunches with local officials. I remember asking agricultural
                    officials what they thought of the coming harvest was going to be that season.
                    They'd say, oh they think it's going to be better. Well, they hadn't themselves
                    been out of Asmara because it was worth their life to travel out as they would
                    be shot or kidnapped. They had no idea what was actually going on out in the
                    countryside. That's essentially what the Ethiopian occupation was. They
                    controlled all of the principal towns, and particularly the ones along the
                    supply lines to the south to Ethiopia. The rest of it was effectively beyond
                    their control. They didn't make heroic efforts to go and challenge the rebels.
                    They'd occasionally bomb or shell certain areas or suspected infiltration
                    routes, but they weren't carrying out any significant counterinsurgency
                    operations per se. At that time, they just let things play out because they
                    figured as long as they held all the centers of the productive activity in the
                    territory; that was all they needed to do. The senior official there was called
                    the Martial Law Administrator, a Brigadier General named Getachew. I got to know
                    him reasonably well. He had been to the United States, and had attended the Army
                    staff college probably under IMET, the International Military Education Training
                    program. As a result he had a reasonably favorable opinion of the United States.
                    This was at a time, however, when there was an evolution of attitude among Derg
                    officials towards the United States. The government was going increasingly
                    moving to the leftist camp, and was now receiving assistance from bloc countries
                    and Cubans. They had asked the Soviets and the Cubans to help them repel the
                    Somali incursions in the past, and they were becoming more and more dependent on
                    them for arms. Every time they would ask us for replacement weapons, as we'd
                    been their principal arms supplier, there was a clear reluctance and often a
                    long hiatus between the request and even the partial fulfillment of those
                    requests. They were viewing the United States as an unreliable supplier of
                    military equipment. Again it was a military government faced with insurgency not
                    only in Eritrea, but in other parts of the country as well. They needed a
                    reliable source of arms and they weren't getting it. They felt the United States
                    was not living up to its part of the bargain. So, they turned more and more
                    toward the Soviets, and more of the Derg's rhetoric had a Marxist tone. This
                    fellow Mengistu was beginning to emerge as the leading figure in the group.
                    Initially he had several lieutenants behind him, but increasingly as time wore
                    on his subordinates disappeared from view. The next thing you knew, they'd been
                    executed or exiled.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>In any event, as that whole process was unfolding, there was a growing problem in
                    terms of how the consulate viewed the insurgency in Eritrea and how the embassy
                    in Addis viewed it. That is not an uncommon problem, yet we felt it was our
                    obligation to report things as we saw them. In the time that I was there, some
                    21 months, there were at least 450 Eritrean civilians killed in reprisal actions
                    by Ethiopian government security or military forces. In some cases it was
                    parallel police. Shortly after I arrived there had been an assassination of an
                    Ethiopian officer in a certain neighborhood. That very evening, troops from
                    units that he had commanded came into that neighborhood and dragged people out
                    of their homes and eviscerated and left their bodies around the assassination
                    site. There were 45 people killed in retaliation. We quickly learned of it. The
                    Eritrean staff, our FSNs, would tell us without embellishment what happened. So,
                    we would attempt to confirm it, to get good solid information, and then we would
                    report it. We had the right and authority to report directly to the Department,
                    and we'd also send copies to Addis. That was never really challenged. Our
                    embassy was trying to retain a shred of proper and friendly relations with the
                    Ethiopians, and these atrocities placed a strain on this process. We still had a
                    functioning military mission in Addis. We had a fairly large defense attach�
                    office as well. By reporting these things and sending them to Washington, we
                    could be seen to be undermining that effort to retain the basics of a
                    relationship. The Embassy conveyed a sense that we could be a little less
                    sensational in reporting these incidents. We said when one person is
                    assassinated and 45 people are killed in retaliation, it's very difficult to put
                    any other face on it than as an atrocity. To be fair about it, Art Tienken was
                    the DCM and he's a very good and decent man, and he could see our perspective.
                    As such, there was no real effort to censor or quash what we were reporting,
                    thank God. This was not always the case with his successor, Peter Sebastian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Art Hummel was the ambassador. When his tour was up, the U.S. didn't
                    send anybody out for a long period of time so Art Tienken became the Charg�. Art
                    Hummel was sort of an odd choice for Ethiopia. He was Old School, an old Asian
                    hand. He was born in China, a missionary child, and he actually fought in the
                    Chinese nationalist resistance against the Japanese occupation. China was his
                    area of expertise, and he ended up going to China eventually. He was a very
                    elegant and decent man. His wife was very nice and gracious, of the old Foreign
                    Service. The Embassy had this fantastic compound in Addis, the former Japanese
                    Embassy and residence. We used to get down to Addis fairly frequently because it
                    was important to maintain our contacts with the Embassy. While we had all the
                    restrictions on our movements, etc., they had no such restrictions. There was a
                    curfew in Addis, at 10:00 pm, I think, but you could show a pass and no one
                    would open fire on you. So, we would visit the Embassy to make sure that we
                    understood one another and that knew the personalities we were dealing with in
                    Addis.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>As I say, Ambassador Hummel was a very decent fellow, of the old Foreign Service,
                    but there was one issue that I brought to his attention that I was disappointed
                    with how he reacted. In Asmara, whenever you went for an official appointment
                    the Ethiopian security guards insisted that you submit to a search. I remember
                    going to see the mayor of Asmara and the guard kept insisting that I had to go
                    through a body search and of my briefcase. I had an appointment made well in
                    advance, so I just got my back up. I refused as a consular officer to be
                    searched and insisted that the guard call the mayor to tell him I would not be
                    coming because of the search requirement. I tried to make it clear that they had
                    to respect my rights and immunities. Of course, that effort went over the
                    guard's head, but he did call the Mayor's office and was told not to search me.
                    I was trying; one by one, to preserve my rights and the respect to which a
                    consular officer is entitled intact. Another time, I was a non-pro courier
                    bringing a classified diplomatic pouch to Addis and airport security insisted
                    that I open the pouch. I told them that, if they insisted, I would take the
                    pouch and go back on the plane to Asmara. The confrontation kept escalating to
                    higher and higher levels. Eventually, I won the point, although it took over an
                    hour. It took that kind of willingness to face these people down. So, I brought
                    this issue to the ambassador hoping for his and the Embassy's support. He said
                    that even when he went to the movies the Ethiopians insisted on searching him
                    and he didn't it was big deal. So I didn't get any satisfaction on this, so we
                    just had to carry on the fight ourselves. I must say, however, we pretty much
                    made the point and increasingly they didn't hassle us. They eventually realized
                    that we did have certain rights and privileges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in Eritrea, was Kagnew Station, had that gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No. In point of fact that's why we still had a consulate there at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you explain what Kagnew Station is?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, that's a good idea. The history goes back quite a way. What is
                    extraordinary about Asmara is the location is not only is it 7,700 feet, but it
                    has beautiful, clear weather most of the time. It's a superb location for
                    telecommunications, communications relay going back to the establishment of
                    Radio Marconi in the 1920s by the Italians. It was used by the Italians to
                    communicate with their east African provinces and navy. They could get radio
                    signals from Rome or from Libya and then retransmit them into the Indian Ocean
                    and along the coast. In the Second World War the British Captured Eritrea in
                    1940 and they set up their own facility. They realized that you could not only
                    receive and relay communications, but you could also intercept their enemies'
                    signals. It became a very important interception location. If you read some of
                    the literature on this, for example “The Bodyguard of Lies,” we helped the
                    British even before we entered the war in these interception activities. In
                    particular, just before the D-Day invasion, the Japanese military attach� in
                    Berlin had inspected the West Wall and prepared a very detailed report on the
                    fortifications in Normandy and in Calais. We had broken the Japanese diplomatic
                    code. We intercepted this report, broke the code and had a fairly detailed idea
                    of what the allied invasion forces would confront. It proved to be a remarkably
                    important facility during that phase.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Beyond that when the war ended the British continued to maintain their
                    communication, telecommunication facility there so they could communicate
                    throughout south Asia and relay communications, and they probably did some
                    intercept work. In 1952 when the U.N. mandated Eritrea's semi-autonomous
                    federation with Ethiopia, the Americans negotiated an agreement to set up a
                    telecommunications facility in Asmara called Kagnew Station. It became more and
                    more sophisticated as time went on, and at its peak in the mid-1960s, there
                    6,500 Americans there. It was a massive operation with 13 sites. It did
                    telecommunications relay, and telecommunication intercept work. Increasingly,
                    Kagnew got more and more sophisticated equipment. It had a huge dish antennae
                    that was some 80 feet across and it took them weeks to get it up from Massawa,
                    up the winding road to the heights of Asmara to install it. It cost millions of
                    dollars. I remember in my time we sold it for scrap for $6,000. In any event,
                    Kagnew had been a tremendously successful operation over the years. For example,
                    it had provided the communications relay for Kissinger's early trips to China,
                    first the secret mission and then the Nixon visit. It had the capability to
                    communicate directly to Beijing from Asmara and then relay to Europe and then to
                    the U.S. Telecommunications technology was constantly changing, and while I was
                    there, DOD was considering its options. First there were the costs versus the
                    efficiency of the technology; then there was the threat from the insurgency
                    which included safety risks to its personnel. Our profile, while much reduced
                    from its peak of 6500, was still very high with some 60 Americans and three
                    sites plus the main base compound still in operation. We were still viewed as we
                    had been in our heyday when Kagnew employed thousands of Eritreans. We had
                    operated our own television and AM/FM radio stations. They had a big R&amp;R
                    facility down in Massawa for the Kagnew families. They could go to the Red Sea
                    and go swimming and rent boats and all that. They had helicopter communications
                    between those R &amp; R sights. They had a hunting lodge in Keren and other
                    recreational activities in the region. The Americans had also become involved in
                    charitable activities. They supported an eye hospital, and had programs to fly
                    people, especially children, back to the United States for medical treatment.
                    Americans had an excellent reputation. The Eritreans really liked the Americans
                    because of all we had done there and because they had treated the Eritreans with
                    decency. Our reputation, however, had begun to erode by the time I arrived.
                    There were about 55 to 60 Americans operating three sights at that stage because
                    satellites had taken up much of the burden. We still had interception
                    capabilities and other telecommunications relay capabilities. The U.S. Navy was
                    now operating the facility primarily for communication relay for the Indian
                    Ocean fleet. Kagnew still provided useful and reliable telecommunications relay
                    activity. There were 11 or 12 U.S. Navy personnel and the rest of the Americans
                    were contractors. They lived on the main base, the American part of which was
                    one tenth of what it had once been, the rest having been taken over my the
                    Ethiopian military. The outlying facilities had been automated to a certain
                    degree and they were at some distance from the main base. The issue of whether
                    the DOD was going to retain Kagnew was an open ended question. From a budgetary
                    perspective, they basically wanted to retain it at a minimal cost since no money
                    had been budgeted to replace it. This was fine for the near term, but as the
                    political situation evolved and the tensions between the U.S. and the Ethiopian
                    government increased, the future was very uncertain. Among the insurgents, the
                    “fighters “as the Eritreans called their countrymen, out in the bush, there was
                    a sense that the need to maintain Kagnew was why the American continued to
                    support the Ethiopians despite the increasing friction. Despite the residual
                    friendly and cordial relations between Americans at Kagnew and the Eritreans,
                    the insurgents tried to figure out ways to get this message across to the
                    American government. This resulted in their actions against Kagnew operations
                    and particularly the Americans operating them. The insurgents had just begun a
                    campaign of kidnapping foreigners to get some international attention. They
                    seized the British honorary consul, a British businessman and marched him off in
                    broad daylight into the bush. He was released almost a year later, and was the
                    better for the experience reportedly having lost weight and being more fit than
                    ever. The first kidnapping of Americans was when they overran one of our
                    outlying facilities at night. There was a just skeletal staff there, and no real
                    guards to speak of. They took the two Americans hostage and marched them off
                    into the bush. In total there were five Americans kidnapped; two more at a
                    remote site and one from his home is Asmara. They were all eventually released,
                    having been held for about 10 months to 15 months. They were all treated well.
                    When they were released, in Sudan in every instance, they had no complaint.
                    Things became much more somber however, when two Americans were killed. I
                    remember as I was the acting principal officer at the time when the two
                    Americans were killed in a land mine explosion. The insurgents had planted a
                    land mine on the roads to one of the outlying sites. It was placed in a mud
                    puddle and, as such, the American couldn't see any sign of it. Two civilian
                    contractors were driving a pick up truck when they hit the mine. They were blown
                    right through the roof of the cab and were killed instantly. That event cast a
                    pall on all of Kagnew's operations. We were surprised and much taken aback that
                    the insurgents did this. We never learned whether they were after us or whether
                    they were after Ethiopian patrols. We were certain that they knew damn well that
                    the Americans came down that road and, if they really cared to avoid harming
                    Americans, they would not have done that. That was the only such deadly
                    incident, but it was bad enough and it accelerated planning for alternatives to
                    Kagnew. We did close down that sight; it was just too remote. The Navy shifted
                    to using two sites closer to the main facility. The Navy's general sense was,
                    whatever the threat, they were tolerable for the time being, so let's try to
                    keep this thing going if we can. We did, and Kagnew personnel came in and went
                    out. The contractors were paid well, and they were basically self-sustaining.
                    Kagnew hired very substantial numbers of Eritreans on construction and
                    maintenance crews and this kept whole facility running at a relatively low cost.
                    All the costs were largely sunk costs and they had already been amortized.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Kagnew was the key rationale for the Consulate being there. There were six
                    positions at the consulate, although that included a secretary who was sent down
                    to Addis after the situation began to get dicey with the kidnappings. In
                    addition to the five Americans, all males, there were six marine guards. That
                    was our total complement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the, was it consulate general or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: There was a consul general, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: George Sherry was the first one, and Bob Slutz was the second. Again,
                    neither one was really an African area specialist, but they were good solid
                    officers, and did a credible job. There was a very small consular community in
                    Asmara. The British had an honorary consul who was kidnapped six months or so
                    into my tour, and not replaced. There was a small French consulate and a
                    Sudanese consulate as well. There was an Italian Consulate General because of
                    the number of Italian citizens, which, after that initial January of '75 attack,
                    had dropped to perhaps 3000. As the situation returned to a degree of stability,
                    the numbers then returned to as many as 9000. The official policy of the Italian
                    government was to have the Italians out of harms way and it was paying
                    resettlement allowances for them to return to Italy. I got to know a number of
                    Italians in Asmara, and they were really nice and gracious people. Of course,
                    they were all neo-fascists, if you will. You could find Mussolini buttons and
                    other fascist memorabilia in stores throughout Asmara. Many of the Italians were
                    brought to Eritrea under Mussolini and they harked back to the glory days. The
                    Italians in Asmara thought that Italy was in the grasp of the communists, or
                    worse yet the socialists. They had no use for any of these groups, and the idea
                    of going back to live in Italy was just an anathema. As I said, they had a very
                    good life in Eritrea and they wanted to hang onto that.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Again, their community went back up to over 9,000 after the January '75 draw
                    down. The Ethiopian government preferred that the Italians not come back to
                    Eritrea, and they put restrictions on their return, in part because it thought
                    that the Italians were colluding with the rebels. In some cases, the Italians
                    would sneak back through Sudan to Asmara through the rebel side. They were
                    welcomed by the Eritreans, who felt that the Italians, at least recently,
                    treated them decently. I will say that, while the Italians didn't provide the
                    Eritreans a university, they did provide them vocational training. As a result,
                    Eritreans learned to do just about anything a European could do in terms of
                    operating and maintaining equipment and doing whatever was necessary to keep
                    things running. For example, the Eritreans ran the power plant and the water
                    pumping station in Addis. As there had been some acts of sabotage in Addis, the
                    Ethiopians decided that the Eritreans were a threat to the security of their
                    capital, and began to expel the Eritreans. Once they started the process, they
                    quickly realized that the Eritreans ran all these vital operations and that
                    there were no Ethiopians who could do it. Then they had to relent and allow them
                    to stay. Of course, Ethiopian Air Lines was operated almost entirely by
                    Eritreans Likewise, most of the pilots, both air force pilots and the airline
                    pilots were Eritreans.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>So there was some appreciation for what the Italians had done for them. During my
                    time there, I saw the Italians treat the Eritreans reasonably well, although
                    sometimes they could be harsh and critical. Given the extensive intermarriage at
                    the lower socio-economic level, this is not surprising. The Italian consul
                    general had large responsibilities. Besides himself, there was a consul,
                    vice-consuls and had a technical staff. The French consulate officer was a
                    career officer, a vice consul with some African experience. The Sudanese consul
                    general was a really nice fellow, both honest and frank, and obviously
                    sympathetic to the Eritreans. I learned later that he was in contact with the
                    insurgents. I met him later when I was Sudan Desk Officer and he had become the
                    chief of protocol at the Sudanese foreign ministry. He told me that the
                    insurgents knew about our movements and where I lived, but he told the fighters
                    not to give my any trouble; not to come after me. For much of my time there,
                    until the kidnappings became a serious threat, I was living off the compound,
                    and they knew where I was. There weren't that many foreigners and they knew
                    where everybody was. He told the rebels to leave me alone, because I was a good
                    guy and was sympathetic, which I was. I suppose it's not very professional, but
                    I felt that their cause was not being properly represented in the West, that we
                    had gone so far down the line to try to maintain a relationship with the
                    Ethiopians. In doing so, we had forgotten some of our basic values. After all,
                    the Eritreans were fighting for self-determination, it was their country, they
                    had been betrayed by the West. The UN mandate for federal autonomy had been
                    ignored albeit by Haile Selassie and we had acquiesced in that action. We saw
                    American-made aircraft dropping American bombs on the Eritreans. They would come
                    to us and ask, how could you do this to us, we have been your host for many
                    decades and we've never mistreated you and now you've given the weapons to our
                    enemies to kill our people. We in the Consulate heard what they were saying, but
                    beyond telling the story as accurately as we could to Washington, we could
                    little more. We tried to make the point, but ultimately we were losing our
                    ability to persuade the Eritreans of our sympathy. It was to the time that the
                    U.S. military mission would learn about military activities, but would not share
                    this intelligence with us. This really riled me because our security could be at
                    risk. I got the consul general riled up on this as well. The MilMish (US
                    Military Mission) had contacts in the Ethiopian military, and they even
                    occasionally visited counterparts in Asmara without advising the consul general
                    of their visit. They would discuss with their contacts in the Ethiopian garrison
                    about what they needed which was indicative of their operations. They would
                    return to Addis and make their recommendations to DOD, and never share their
                    information on the security situation with the consulate. We took great offense
                    at this and eventually we required them to obtain our clearance before they
                    visited. The MilMish was apparently concerned that, if it shared what it learned
                    with us, it would compromise its relationship with the Ethiopian military which
                    was increasingly tenuous. When you think about it, putting its relationship with
                    the Ethiopian regime over the safety of their fellow Americans is a sad
                    commentary. Ultimately the Ethiopians prevented them from traveling to Asmara.
                    As the kidnappings continued, we reached a point where it was considered too
                    hazardous for dependents and they were sent to Addis or back to the U.S. Even
                    the RMO would only come up for an afternoon. He'd come up and he'd say. . .</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Regional Medical Officer. He'd say, I'm responsible for these people,
                    but I don't think I want to spend the night. He met with whoever needed advice
                    or an examination, inventory of the medical cabinet and then he was gone.
                    Basically, if you wanted to see him you had to go down to Addis. Basically the
                    routine of life in Asmara at that time was a repetitive routine. It would start
                    at 6:00 when the curfew lifted and suddenly the streets would buzz with
                    activity. Because of restrictions on travel to the countryside, food was
                    oftentimes in short supply. For example, they'd run out of the peppers that they
                    put into their zighani, their meat or vegetable stew. There was great
                    consternation when there were no peppers. Teff, a kind of wheat that they used
                    to make the injera was often in short supply. Gasoline was tightly rationed; 20
                    liters a week per vehicle. Twenty liters wouldn't get you very far, but then you
                    couldn't drive very far anyway. So, a lot of horse carts were brought back into
                    service. Eritrea was going backwards in many ways. Once the daily activities
                    would get underway, usually in a beautiful sunny day in the mid 70s, people
                    would go about their business. It was an industrial city, with the textile
                    plants, the brewery etc. in full operation. The Melotti beer was probably the
                    best of the three breweries in the country. There were several big textile
                    plants as well factories making tiles and building materials. There was a active
                    Ethiopian Airlines operation at the airport. By the afternoon, business people
                    would take a siesta and then return to work between 3:00 and 6:00. There was a
                    great rush to the stores and bars, and some would be open to 6:30 and then
                    everything closed down. By 6:30 everybody was off the street, and by 7:00 the
                    curfew went into effect. The streets were empty and quiet. With the kidnappings,
                    we were all eventually moved onto the Consulate compound with the Marines, the
                    CG's residence and another residence which became a sort of BOQ. Everybody would
                    then have dinner and then assemble in the consulate reception area and projected
                    movies from the Army-Air Force movie circuit. We'd settle in and then start the
                    movies about 8:00. Often by 9:00 the gunfire would start in the city. So we'd
                    shut down the projector and the marines put on their flak jackets and helmets
                    and would take their firing positions on the perimeter. In addition to the six
                    marines, we had eight locally hired guards who were armed with 45 caliber
                    pistols. We had some seven Ethiopian military personnel armed with two machine
                    guns. Our marine NCOIC was the commander of the guard force, and he was to
                    ensure that these other guards didn't do something stupid like shoot at anybody
                    on the street. They were to fire only if someone tried to come over the wall. We
                    would go over and over the rules of engagement. Old Radio Marconi facility,
                    which was now the Ethiopian naval headquarters, shared our south wall. They had
                    a cement guard box at either end of this wall on the adjacent streets So when
                    the insurgents would dash along the shadows in these streets, the Ethiopian navy
                    security force would open fire down these streets on either side of us. We'd
                    just sit tight, turn out all the lights and the marines would radio us what was
                    going on. We sat in the doorways so that you'd stay out of the line of fire, and
                    hear bullets going through the trees. Consulate officers were not part of the
                    defense force, and I had full confidence in the marine detachment. They were
                    good people, solid guys. The shooting would go on for an hour or an hour and a
                    half. Finally it would subside, lights would begin to go on in the neighborhood
                    again and then we'd go back and flip on the projector and see to the rest of the
                    movie.</p>

                <p>We used to have official visitors spend the night in Asmara, and some thought we
                    were putting this on for them; that this was part of a show. We said, this is
                    pretty much the routine every night. Sometimes flares would go off and we could
                    see who was moving up and down the streets. You could see people like rats
                    scurrying across the street as the insurgents were circling around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to talk to Eritrean insurgents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, not directly and we were not authorized to establish contact with
                    them. That was clear and we had to respect instruction from the Embassy in Addis
                    because it would have undermined the credibility of our bilateral relationship.
                    We knew we were talking to people who were talking to the rebels, and we knew
                    that our own staff was talking to them as well. These contacts would give us
                    insights into rebel thinking. As in most African countries, the elites knew one
                    another. They often shared educational experiences whether it was the schools in
                    the city or overseas in Italy or elsewhere. They often knew rebel leaders and
                    had some idea of their perspective. We could cross check information with other
                    sources. We talked to the Italians who had excellent contacts. They may well
                    have been in touch with the other side the Italians still living in insurgent
                    held areas. The Sudanese consulate had good sources as well, and we knew they
                    were in touch with the rebels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this, well '75 to '77 period, were you picking up
                        from your contacts in Addis and what you were observing the growing
                        nastiness or whatever you want to call it of the dirge and who was the
                        man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. I'll tell you we had one story that was later confirmed by the
                    Embassy, but we picked it up first even though it happened in Addis. There was
                    an army colonel named Daniel, an Eritrean, and a formerly a trusted lieutenant
                    of Mengistu. There rumors of a conspiracy to overthrow the Derg leaders. So,
                    Mengistu called a conference of the Derg leadership, the composition of which
                    was not known to anybody outside the group. Our PAO in Addis, Art Lewis, a black
                    guy and a very capable and intense officer, seemed to be the only one who had
                    reliable contacts with the Derg. Our CIA people only seemed to know one or two
                    members, but Art must have known a dozen. We thought there were maybe as many as
                    40 members of the Derg. In any event, on this particular day Mengistu learned
                    that something was cooking among elements of the Derg. Mengistu convoked them to
                    a meeting hall in the old royal palace. They all appeared at the appropriate
                    moment except for this colonel Daniel fellow who was late to arrive. At the
                    appointed moment Mengistu stepped out of the meeting with a couple of his
                    trusted people, and suddenly the doors opened, his bodyguards burst in and
                    machine gunned everybody in the room. Daniel arrived just as the attack was
                    taking place and when he heard gunfire he figured out what was going on and he
                    took off. He eventually made it into rebel territory.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Another time, I was down in Addis when a member of the Derg, Colonel Sisay, also
                    an Eritrean, and the deputy commander of the air force met his fate. He had been
                    sent by the Derg to Eritrea to do an assessment of the possibilities of winning
                    the war there. He returned to Addis and told the Derg that there was no way that
                    it could win militarily. They had to make peace, had to find a political
                    solution. Mengistu was not happy with this. The officer returned to his home
                    after giving this report, and the Derg sent armored vehicles to surround his
                    house. They did not give him a chance to surrender. They opened fire and
                    absolutely leveled his house. They killed him, his family and his servants. They
                    just fired until the house was rubble. That what happened when you told the Derg
                    what it didn't want to hear. They were getting increasingly vicious and
                    repressive. During this time the Derg launched the red terror in Addis. It
                    created a group of the parallel police to eliminate its enemies. There was a
                    group of even more radical Marxists who were proselytizing among the young
                    people. The parallel police were picking up young students in the Addis area
                    just before curfew. They were tortured and their bodies were found the next
                    morning. In Asmara there was a similar process. Our sources among the Eritreans
                    would give me the license numbers of some of the cars that they were using This
                    process of red terror reflected the Derg's paranoia. One of the reason that
                    Mengistu's paranoia was that he was a graduate of an inferior staff college and
                    was viewed by other Ethiopian military officers as having risen by the back
                    steps of the hierarchy. He also had a reputation in the military as a
                    troublemaker who had been moved from one post to another, one garrison to
                    another, because he constantly created trouble. He was an agitator for one cause
                    or another. Therefore he was not well regarded by the more serious and more
                    traditional Ethiopian military leaders. He was only a lieutenant colonel. He had
                    retired or imprisoned most of the generals, but there were still some full
                    colonels around. These feelings of inadequacy were said to motivate him to
                    eliminate his potential opponents. As I said, his fellow Derg members
                    periodically disappeared and were later found to have been executed. During this
                    time he also apparently poisoned Haile Selassie. The Derg claimed he died of
                    natural causes, although no one really believed that. There was very little in
                    way of mourning in Eritrea for the departure of the Emperor; only in the sense
                    that he had to some extent protected them from some of the worst excesses of the
                    Derg had he continued to live. But when the Emperor died, the Eritreans knew
                    things were going to get worse which they did. During the red terror in Addis
                    Mengistu's would shoot these young students and their bodies would be laid out
                    in the yard outside of the hospital. Then the parents came looking for their
                    children and the police would say, if you find your child you can have the body
                    if you pay for the cost of the bullet used to shoot them. So, there was seething
                    resentment against the Derg, but it ruled with an iron hand and they had all the
                    elements of the security apparatus completely and thoroughly under their
                    control.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had back in 1960, '61 been in INR and I had the horn of
                        Africa and I had never been there, but anyway of course everything at that
                        time was predicated on Kagnew Station. That meant that we gave very short
                        shrift to Somalia, you know, if you had to and Haile Selassie of course was
                        firmly in control. There must have been sort of a real sort of title change
                        wasn't there? I mean as satellites replaced antenna, Kagnew was no longer
                        important; it was becoming less and less important. Then you had this very
                        nasty government which we were finding I assume harder and harder to stomach
                        in a way. Were you watching this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, we used to ask why we are going down this path with the Ethiopians
                    so slavishly. Part of the explanation we were told at that time was that, under
                    Kissinger with the withdrawal from Vietnam in April of 1975, there was a
                    question about American reliability and about its commitments to other
                    countries. As a result the U.S. felt it was important to maintain our
                    credibility by trying to maintain a relationship with Ethiopia even though Haile
                    Selassie who had been our special friend was gone. Haile Selassie, in his later
                    days, became increasingly repressive because, like many of these chiefs of state
                    in the Third World, he had created the conditions for his own overthrow. He
                    established the national university, actually Haile Selassie University. It was
                    highly regarded and was very successful in its international connections. There
                    were many academic exchanges; the Ethiopians went overseas, Americans came to
                    Ethiopia on the Fulbright program and other schemes. At universities people
                    asked questions; for example, why do we live under an absolute monarchy; there's
                    got to be a better way to rule our country. It was these university students who
                    led to the popular uprising, which the emperor tried to suppress, and after many
                    bloody confrontations, the military said enough, we refused to shoot anymore
                    young people. They rose up against the emperor and their leadership formed the
                    military that became the Derg. Even as this group became increasingly radical
                    under Mengistu, the U.S. government still tried to maintain a relationship,
                    claiming that it was important because of the withdrawal from Vietnam. We
                    recognized the emperor had his shortcomings and tried to moderate his actions.
                    We hoped that this military government would transition in to a more democratic
                    process. It didn't prove to be the case and increasingly it went the other
                    way.</p>
                <p>Now, with Washington parroting this line about maintaining relationships, the
                    consulate then had to wrestle with the recognition that things was going sour,
                    and we were trying to bring Washington around to realize that we were reaching a
                    point of diminishing returns. About the only way we could reflected U.S.
                    concerns was by our responses to request for military equipment. We would
                    examine their requests, we would hesitate and then we would provide only a small
                    percentage of what they asked for. We told them up front this aid was to be used
                    to address external threats, like the Somalis, or the Sudanese, not to repress
                    their own people. They gave us all the assurances, then immediately used it in
                    Eritrea. That was a betrayal of our agreement and we had to call them on it. So,
                    increasingly, each time they asked for something, they had more difficulty
                    getting it. And so, we became an unreliable arms supplier in their minds.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: I did not have much a sense of that. When I later came back to AF/E we
                    became very involved in that issue. There were other crosscurrents at work as
                    well. For example, the Israelis played a role in Ethiopia as well. They were
                    very concerned about the ELF's ties with radical Arab states. They were
                    concerned about Sudan and were interested in seeing if Sudan would become the
                    sort of soft underbelly of Egypt, to keep them sort of off balance. They were
                    providing security assistance to the Derg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there still the Falashas there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: The Falashas were still there, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ethiopian Jews.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. The Ethiopian Jews. They were not at that time the particular
                    focus of anybody, nor were they being subjected to the abuses that came later.
                    In any event, the Israel connection was reflected in the fact that most
                    Ethiopian security forces on the streets carried Uzi submachine guns. There were
                    Israeli advisors assigned to the police and the internal security organs as
                    opposed to the army. They thought that they were ensuring that Eritrea not fall
                    into the hands of Islamic groups and become a radical Islamic state on the Red
                    Sea, i.e., Eritrea under the influence of some nation like Iraq. In reality,
                    that was not really likely because, while Islam bound the ELF together, it was
                    not what motivated the insurgency. Ethnicity was a more important division in
                    Eritrea, which was split almost a 50/50 between Muslins and Coptic Christians,
                    with the Muslims being in the low-lying areas and the Christians in the highland
                    areas. The Christian groups were the more sophisticated and the more connected
                    with the larger ideological movements, where the Arabs were more traditional and
                    local in perspective. The rebels went to the Iraqis only because the Iraqis
                    would help them create trouble wherever they could. While the rebels received
                    some help for the Iraqis in the early 70s, they were not beholding to the
                    Iraqis. The Israelis were mislead as to the threat that radical Islam
                    constituted in Eritrea, but they wanted to keep their finger on the pulse
                    because it was an area of importance to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>In any event, the Horn of Africa is sort of a crossroads in a lot of ways between
                    Islam and Africa and of the Christian-Muslim conflict. There are lots of
                    longstanding feuds and territorial disputes in the region. There were not only
                    the Eritrean separatists, but the Tigrean separatists just to the south of
                    Eritrea. They were pretty quiescent at that time. As history has shown, however,
                    they became the dominant force in Ethiopia when they took over the government in
                    Addis. There was also the Oromo liberation movement in southeast Ethiopia which
                    was becoming more active. There was also an insurgent group along the Sudanese
                    border. The Derg were really under siege in a lot of ways, hence, it became more
                    autocratic and more disinclined to listen to other points of view. Mengistu
                    himself felt that he had to eliminate all potential opponents or contestants for
                    power. The government became more and more distasteful as time went on, and the
                    U.S. conducted assessments to determine how important Ethiopia was to our
                    regional and global interests. The response from DOD focused on the ongoing
                    commitment to support the U.S. military forces in the Indian Ocean and in the
                    Gulf, and that was working well. As I said, there was no budget for any
                    replacement facility at this time, as it seemed to be a relatively cheap
                    operation. Given the Department's policy horizon at that time, Eritrea fell
                    below the radar. To take a cynical perspective, all the costs of the political
                    upheaval including the kidnapping of five Americans and the death of the two
                    technicians were all civilian contractors. The navy complement was only 13 and
                    it administered the operation while these civilian technicians operated the
                    facility. It was a low cost operation and no one was ready to pull plug saying
                    it was no longer important. If Kagnew shut down, then the consulate general
                    would have shut down as well. Our other interests in Eritrea were limited and
                    increasingly not worth the risk. There were some American missionaries there and
                    we wanted to follow events there, but it would never have been enough to warrant
                    maintaining a consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviets play much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, there was some concern that the Soviets were looking for a Red
                    Sea port for rest and refit, and refueling their ships. Ethiopia's relationship
                    with the Soviets began to improve under the Derg because it was looking for
                    alternative source of weapons, and the Derg leaders started parroting leftist
                    jargon. Mengistu declared that he was a Marxist-Leninist. The Soviets were very
                    pleased, they thought they had a convert, and did not have to try very hard to
                    persuade them. Marxist Leninism, as was the case in many other Third World
                    countries, was an instrument of maintaining political control over their people
                    more than it was philosophical conviction. If you had asked Mengistu what the
                    tenets of Marxist Leninism were, he would have a damned difficult time telling
                    you. Basically it was it was a unifying concept that allowed him to require
                    loyalty of all his subordinates, and he was the head of the Supreme Soviet, if
                    you will, of Ethiopia. As this process developed, there were concerns that the
                    Soviets moving in to replace the U.S., and there were reports that the Soviets
                    were seeking the right to take on fresh water and to refuel in Massawa. This had
                    a very sinister tone. We didn't like the concept of the Soviets being in the Red
                    Sea in any capacity, but the Ethiopians were going to do what they were going to
                    do. We didn't have much influence remaining as we were increasingly viewed as an
                    unreliable arms supplier by this time. So, we were concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go down to Massawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I did, yes, God, it was the hottest place I've ever been in my life. It
                    was in October, which was supposed to be the coolest time part of the year. We
                    had two Americans stationed in Massawa to conduct liaison with the authorities
                    and to handle Kagnew material which occasionally still came through Massawa.
                    When I first arrived, there was still some private travel by the spectacular
                    road with its hair-raising switchbacks to Massawa, but following several
                    ambushes, all such travel was by air. The air distance was about 35 miles and by
                    land it's over 100 miles while dropping a mile and a half. It became too
                    hazardous to try and drive down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was because of insurgency?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, the insurgents attacked even in daylight hours. The Ethiopians
                    hadn't made a heroic effort to keep the road open. They didn't have large forces
                    deployed to try to keep the rebels away. I traveled by air to visit our little
                    liaison facility and I was able to see what we used to control in Massawa. We
                    had several large warehouses, a barracks and recreational facilities and as well
                    as docks. When I got off the plane, which had basically just taken off and then
                    glided down the escarpment, I was floored by the heat. On the Red Sea, it is not
                    only hot, it is oppressively humid. This was in October and the America liaison
                    officer said, what are you talking about, this is the cool season. It was about
                    115 degrees I guess when I landed. I guess in the dead of night it got down to
                    100. We were put up in an Italian villa right on the Red Sea that had
                    electricity, which much of Massawa did not.. There was no interruption and the
                    unit air conditioners made it tolerable. It was clearly a city under siege with
                    about half of its original population. It wasn't so much that it was shot up;
                    there was just no activity to speak of. The port was virtually shut down because
                    there was no place to transport the incoming freight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Addis, Ethiopia proper get its supplies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Assab, which is the only other port along Ethiopia's coast. It was also
                    claimed by Eritrea, although I think that they have now agreed to allow the
                    Ethiopians unfettered access to the port. Assab at that time had become their
                    principal port for fuel and commodities. There was a rail line running to Addis.
                    There had been a rail line from Massawa up to Asmara, but it was out of
                    operation. It had been knocked out for some years before I got there because it
                    had been sabotaged many times. The port of Assab became the principal reason why
                    the Derg said it would never permit an independent Eritrea. Ethiopia would be
                    cut off from the rest of the world and become a landlocked country. They
                    acknowledged that Massawa was part of Eritrea, but they tried redrawing of maps
                    to claim that Assab never really was part of Eritrea. That was a great concern
                    to all Ethiopians; to become landlocked was intolerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Djibouti play a role in what you were doing? Wasn't it
                        under French control?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. Djibouti was an alternate port for the government of Addis, but
                    not a very important one. They weren't so sure whether they could depend on the
                    French and its port indefinitely. They wanted a port they could control and
                    Assab became the port for them. We knew that Eritreans insurgents operated in
                    and out of Djibouti and, I think the French would turn a blind eye to their
                    activities. The Sudanese insurgency in southern Sudan was a continuing problem
                    for Ethiopia. Those rebels would be driven out by the Sudanese government into
                    Eritrea in some cases and in others into Ethiopia. The Ethiopian forces would
                    drive them back across the border. There were occasional incursions and this was
                    one of the Derg's justifications for its need for arms. They were concerned
                    about the protection of their borders with Somalia and Sudan, and they tried to
                    make that a rational case. Ironically when I got to AF/E later we were then
                    listening to the Sudanese concerns about the threat from the Ethiopians. In any
                    event, in terms of its neighbors, the Derg was concerned with Kenya in that
                    Somali insurgents were operating in the eastern Kenya which has a very
                    significant Somali population, and this might spill over into Ethiopia. This
                    Kenyan component was one of the five points on Somalia's flag's five-pointed
                    star. There is Italian and British Somaliland, now Somalia, and then Djibouti,
                    the Ogaden region of Ethiopia and Kenya. They are the five parts of the greater
                    Somalia. The Ethiopians were concerned that some day Somalia would unify all
                    these elements and, because Somalia is supposedly the most rational national
                    entity in because it has one language, one ethnicity and religion, they would
                    pose a threat to its neighbors. . Yet look at Somalia today. It's in complete
                    meltdown.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly, but there was the concern that they would bring it all
                    together and then Djibouti would be threatened and then the Ogaden, which some
                    thought might have mineral resources and oil, and then northeast Kenya.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then as a political officer, what was your job? I
                        mean it doesn't sound like a hell of a lot of politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I was the DPO, I was the consular officer, political officer, and
                    the economic officer, as well. In the consular we had a very fine consular
                    assistant who did most of the work, and I didn't have too many problems in that
                    area. The economic and political side of it was very difficult because all
                    representation efforts had to be done at lunches. Some people used the few
                    hotels to host a decent lunch. But, generally you would do representation at our
                    homes. The first residence I had was right across the street from the Consulate.
                    When I went in to look at this place which they were fixing up, there was a
                    50-caliber bullet hole all the way through the house. It had come from the
                    pillbox at the Naval HQ and had gone from the living room, through the dining
                    room and out through the kitchen. I thought, this isn't really very encouraging.
                    They did patch it up, and I lived there for a few months until there was a
                    firefight right across my house and I spent an hour or so on the floor. For
                    security and representational reasons they found me a very nice villa on the
                    other side of the Consulate. That one had 36 bullet holes in it, but it was
                    above the Naval HQ so no one could shoot across it. They fixed it up and
                    furnished it. I hosted lunches there as it had quite elegant gardens. I was the
                    only consulate officer to live off the compound, and after the kidnappings, I
                    was required to move back to the compound. We retained this villa so I could
                    continue to host representational functions. I had a adequate cook and a
                    gardener who did quite a good job. Representational lunches were confined to
                    businessmen and government officials. Businessmen were very constrained in what
                    they would say because of the threat of nationalization, and the government
                    officials would blatantly lie to you because they didn't know what was going on
                    and they were terrified of departing from the party line. I did get to know
                    General Getachew, the Martial Law Administrator, but he would not come to my
                    home. Most military officers kept their distance from the Americans, although
                    our Kagnew managers were in contact with the second division commander</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I'll digress for a moment to give you a sense of the complete authority that
                    Getachew had. One morning I arrived at the consulate and as I passed our senior
                    local Mesfun Hailu, I asked “How's it going today?” He said, “Not very well.” I
                    thought that's strange. I said, “What's going on?” As background, his wife had
                    been arrested for being an accomplice with the insurgents, and she was detained
                    in jail. He had been in contact with her and found that her conditions were
                    okay. Although the charges were bogus, they were trying to force her to confess
                    because two other Eritreans were arrested up from Ethiopian Airlines for whom
                    she worked. The authorities were persuaded that they were raising money or
                    channeling money to the insurgents. He was fairly confident that this thing
                    would blow over as there were no grounds for it, and she'd be released. He said
                    he received a call this morning from my wife saying that she was going to be
                    executed this afternoon. I thought Holy Christ, and asked, “Well, what can I do
                    about it?” He said, “Well, I don't know. I'm at a complete loss. I'm trying to
                    contact people I know.” I offered to call the martial law administrator and talk
                    to him about it. I have a reasonably good relationship with him. He said, “Well,
                    okay, he may get really angry about it and it may make things worse, but what
                    can I do? They're going to execute my wife?” So, I got Getachew on the line and
                    started talking in very general terms about how things were going. Then I said,
                    “By the way, one of our senior employees here, Mesfun Hailu, whose wife has been
                    arrested and he received a phone call this morning from her saying that she'd
                    been told she's going to be executed this afternoon.” God, this guy exploded
                    like a volcano. I'd never seen him react like this before and he said, “Mesfun
                    Hailu is a spy. He's a rebel and his wife is giving them money.” He obviously
                    knew the case. He said, “It's no business of yours. He's an Ethiopian national
                    and you have no right to intervene or you are covering up for spies.” He ranted
                    on and on. I let him vent for about five or ten minutes. Then I said, “Well,
                    general, could I ask you just one thing? Would you see Mesfun and talk to him to
                    see what can be done?” So, he said, “Send him down right away,” and he hung up.
                    I thought, oh my God. I explained it all to Mesfun and he said, “What can I do?”
                    He went down directly to Getachew's office, and I learned later because he too
                    was arrested. Apparently what happened when he went down to the office, he was
                    made to wait for two hours sweating it out right up to the time when the wife
                    was supposed to be executed. Then a detachment troops came in and hauled him
                    before the martial law administrator who just lambasted him, never letting him
                    speak.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>The martial law administrator just blats him for being a spy, for his disloyalty
                    for bringing this to the attention of the Americans, and threatened to shoot
                    him. He ranted at him for ten minutes, and then had the paratroopers haul him
                    out and took him to jail. His brother also worked for us, and I found out from
                    him that Mesfun had been jailed. I thought what the hell am I going to do? At
                    the same time, I realized that he was an Ethiopian national and there are limits
                    in what we are going to be able to do. As it turned out, he was held in jail for
                    about ten days, although he was not abused. Then an agreement was reached. He
                    was released and his wife was expelled from Eritrea and sent to Addis, which was
                    okay. They had four daughters and the daughters then went with the mother down
                    to Addis, and she resumed her employment with Ethiopian Airlines. It's quite a
                    story. She's written a book about her entire experience, as a matter of fact. In
                    any event, Mesfun was then transferred to our Embassy in Addis so that he could
                    be with his family. They both had their families in Asmara, and after Getachew
                    was killed, which I'll explain in a minute, she returned to Asmara to test the
                    waters, flying back and forth. She then brought her four daughters up with her.
                    One night they all slipped away and crossed the lines into rebel territory
                    intending to go to Sudan. They hoped to go to Sudan and then from there to the
                    United States, which they eventually did. The two older daughters decided to
                    stay behind in Eritrea and fight. They were 17 and 19 at that time. They spent
                    the next ten years in the struggle. One was a nurse and the other was a
                    schoolteacher, and of the two was injured in a bombing. In any event, the mother
                    got away and eventually settled in the United States. But the irony was that
                    Getachew, this hardheaded military officer, went to Addis on periodic briefings
                    of the Derg, and finally said to them that the war was unwinnable. There had to
                    be a political solution. He'd seen the way things were and that the resistance
                    was implacable; there was no way to win out. He was sent away from the Derg
                    meeting and returned to his Addis home. Later the same day, the military
                    surrounded his home, destroyed it, and killed him and killed his family and his
                    servants as well.</p>
                <p>This was just one more example of the Derg's ruthlessness and recourse to
                    violence. That was the way in which the place operated. We had another FSN
                    employee, whose brother was picked up on an Asmara street, hauled off and hanged
                    without trial. Other people were summarily executed by Ethiopian authorities.
                    Our sympathies were with those people we knew. Our nationals were suffering.
                    Some of them would leave or would transfer or just couldn't continue to live
                    there any longer, and were driven out of their homes.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>This brings me to the closure of Kagnew and our expulsion from the country. It
                    turned out that the relationship was now very bad and we were receiving reports
                    that the Soviets and the Cubans were gaining influence in Addis and that they
                    were prodding the Ethiopians to change the relationship with the United States
                    because the Americans were unreliable . Our consul general, Bob Slutz had long
                    planned a trip to Europe for R&amp;R. He departed on a Friday morning. I
                    remember because it was the Saturday afternoon that we learned of the expulsion
                    order. We had just come back from playing volleyball over at Kagnew when I got a
                    call from Addis saying that they had just received a diplomatic note saying that
                    five U.S. activities in Ethiopia were to come to cease operations and depart the
                    country in four days. They included Kagnew and the consulate general in Asmara.
                    Also it was the U.S. military mission, the DAO and a naval medical experiment
                    facility. Those three were in Addis. We were to make plans right away to how we
                    would carry out the closeout. I said, all well and good you in Addis, you can
                    move around without a curfew. We were facing in one hour's time a curfew that's
                    worth your life to violate. I got on the phone with the Kagnew navy commander,
                    and the ranking leader of the contractors, and we started our planning. The next
                    day was Sunday. Of course they the expulsion order on a Saturday because they
                    knew Sunday was a non-functioning day and it would make things that much more
                    difficult for us. The expulsion was an extraordinary exercise that ended up
                    lasting six days. We got a two-day extension on the third day. I was the Charg�.
                    The thought of getting Bob Slutz, the CG, back quickly vanished when they
                    figured they couldn't get him back in any reasonable period of time. So they had
                    to count on me, an FSO-3, to manage the evacuation. It turned out to be just
                    constant chaos. I remember the first night we had all these plans by phone and
                    radio, constantly calculating what we would need to do, what the phases would
                    be, what we needed to get out and how we would get the people out. I got two
                    hours of sleep that first night. On Sunday we started to get things together and
                    immediately found that we had two Americans down in Massawa on R&amp;R. The two
                    liaison guys had been transferred out; but Kagnew folks still went on R&amp;R
                    down there. I went to the new martial law administrator and asked his help in
                    getting these people out. He immediately saw an opportunity to essentially he
                    them hostage to be sure that we behaved ourselves and followed their orders.
                    Unfortunately, at the first facility that we started to shut down things went
                    awry. The Ethiopian guards, who were supposed to protect us, now turned against
                    our people and came onto the compound. They went into the buildings and
                    prevented them from destroying the classified equipment, and there was a
                    confrontation. The men at the site foolishly tried to sneak out some firearms in
                    the trunk of a car, and they were caught at it. That tore it. The Ethiopians
                    said we could no longer go back to this compound. Well, we had a lot of
                    classified equipment still there. We communicated the situation to Washington in
                    a flash message because American lives are at risk. The Navy said we had to
                    destroy this communications equipment that is very sensitive, but they had no
                    suggestions as how to do so. So, on Monday we started negotiations with the
                    Ethiopian authorities. I had taken a course on emergency evacuation several
                    moths before, and this was one of the times when training actually served some
                    benefit in the course of this negotiation. In the negotiating course we were
                    told that every detail is important. The first thing you want to figure out is
                    what should be the physical location of the talks. You want to take the opposite
                    sides of the table and put them at the greatest disadvantage that you can.
                    Things like having the sun shine in their eyes. Also, they said, if you know the
                    size of the other delegation provide one less chair than that number so they are
                    scrambling around for a chair and it puts them at a disadvantage. So, I dredged
                    up all the things that I had learned in this course, which at the time thinking
                    I thought was kind of silly.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The Ethiopian delegation was all senior military officers and there was the
                    pre-planned scramble for seating. I was able to lay out for them the issues that
                    we absolutely had to have, and one of them was access back to this facility.
                    Among other points, I asserted the that we were immune from search. They
                    countered that everybody's baggage would have to be searched. We went back and
                    forth on this point. Just to give you an idea of this issue, at the consulate we
                    had something like 30 or more firearms. We had perhaps seven carbines left over
                    from when Kagnew was a bigger operation. Our local Ethiopian guards were paid
                    off and told to leave the compound. .So, in the dead of night, I had our
                    marines, smash all these weapons into pieces and threw them down the defunct
                    well. We didn't want to turn weapons over to the Ethiopians. They did insist
                    that we turn over the 45 automatics from our contract guards. The marines had
                    several Uzis, shotguns and their side arms and we just simply weren't going to
                    turn them over. We had seven classified communications machines at the
                    consulate. We immediately destroyed five of them along with all of the
                    classified material in the consulate. We kept two machines operating, and one
                    principal and one backup. Throughout the negotiation, I sent messages to Addis
                    and Washington and asked that they squeeze the Ethiopians because they are the
                    host of the Organization of African Unity. We had friends among the African
                    delegations, and I wanted the U.S. to go to the government in Addis and demand
                    that the not search our materials. The argument was Ethiopia cannot be the host
                    of the OAU and yet treat consular officials without regard for internationally
                    recognized privileges and immunities. The embassy did prevail upon the
                    authorities, and after awhile the Ethiopians relented. They let us go back to
                    the abandoned facility and agreed that they would not inspect our effects.
                    Before we went back to the site we worked out a destruction plan in advance.
                    First, we decided the essential equipment that we had to destroy, and then a
                    strategy to do so while the Ethiopians weren't paying attention. We decided to
                    have our people carry clipboards as if they were inventorying everything. When
                    the guards got bored with following them around, then they would actually remove
                    what they had to destroy. Things worked out remarkably as we had planned. Those
                    pieces they couldn't disable they destroyed by putting them in a drainage sump
                    with an automatic pump. They would detach as much of the components from the
                    circuit boards as possible and put the pieces in this sump. Whenever anyone put
                    their hand in the sump, the pump would automatically roar into action which
                    would make people disinclined to probe into the sump. They were able to take
                    every element out of it that was classified and needed to be destroyed.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>We were able to pack and ship out some of the unique equipment. On Tuesday, the
                    Ethiopians agreed to extend the evacuation by two days. On Wednesday, the first
                    two C141s landed. These 141s they brought in some Air Force cargo handlers with
                    a forklift trucks and by now the Ethiopians were more cooperative on what we
                    were being allowed to take out. So, we sent out about a third of our people
                    including the two from Massawa who had just returned by air that morning, as
                    well as most of our people's effects. When the first C-141 was loaded and
                    departed, the second aircraft was barely half full. The Air Force guys said,
                    “Don't you have anything else to take out? We're headed back out to Greece.”
                    They saw the principal officer's Chevrolet, which was armored, and it had
                    arrived about three months earlier after months in transit. They said just drive
                    it in the back of the C-141, but make sure it has let than a quarter tank of
                    gas. That was not a problem, since there was gas rationing, the Ethiopians
                    guards quickly siphoned out the gas, and we drove it into the back of the plane.
                    We later got to use it when we were evacuated to Athens. Besides the two people
                    from Massawa, we had a senior contract employee who had a common-law marriage
                    with an Eritrean woman and she had a child He wanted to evacuate her and the
                    child together with him. This proved a major problem as they were Ethiopian
                    nations and not subject to the expulsion order. So after several attempts, I dug
                    out a copy of the Ethiopian law code and I cited the law to the Martial Law
                    Administrator. I knew I had him nailed as the woman qualified under their law
                    for a common law marriage. After a long hesitation, he replied, “Maybe Ethiopian
                    revolutionary law will have to prevail in this case.” I asked if that law had
                    been codified, if not, the prevailing law is what the Ethiopian code says.
                    Unless you can show me that it has been superseded by some subsequent law, it is
                    still the law of your land. In the end, he let the woman and her child leave
                    with us. It was a very exciting and exhilarating time. The DOD was moving ships
                    in toward the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean. A destroyer was dispatched into the
                    Red Sea to provide support if it were needed. Realistically, the Navy would have
                    had to come to Kagnew by helicopter, and at 7,700 feet, a helicopter can't carry
                    much in the way of a payload. So, the C-141s were the way to go. As a
                    operational manager at that time, what I felt was necessary was not only to give
                    clear directions to everybody but also to get them all working together and to
                    prevent our people from doing stupid things. One of our contractors who was
                    packing out his household effects at his villa downtown had too much to drink
                    and he started throwing his clothes and possessions over the wall. This created
                    a disturbance. Of course the police arrived and threatened his arrest. This is
                    just what we didn't need. This fellow was sent out on the first plane.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Another minor crisis was that our local employees, including the unions at Kagnew
                    demanded to be paid off before we departed. The Ethiopian authorities supported
                    this demand. So, I sent a message to the Department and DOD, and they authorized
                    the payment in the form of statements of obligations to pay, which fortunately
                    satisfied our Eritrean workers. Without the cooperation of these employees, our
                    evacuation would have been much more difficult. Then the telephone company said
                    we couldn't leave until we paid their bill as well. I said, talk to the Derg,
                    they ordered the evacuation. I told them to send the bill to our Embassy. I even
                    had to deal with an Ethiopian who lived across the street from me. Weeks before,
                    my gardener had left the brake off in my car and the car had rolled across the
                    street and damaged the neighbor's cement block fence. He now said that I
                    couldn't leave until I'd paid to fix his fence. When the Eritreans heard the
                    Americans were leaving after 35 years, they just wanted their piece of the pie
                    before we closed down. That said, we had a very clear sense that the Eritrean
                    people felt that the forced evacuation of the Americans was the last straw. When
                    the Americans go, they feared that the Ethiopians would be unleashed to conduct
                    ethnic cleansing which would result in great suffering once all the foreigner
                    observers were gone. We tried to reassure them. We also had to try to reassure
                    our FSNs that we would help them. We would have loved to taken them with us on
                    the plane with us, but we couldn't. Nonetheless, they helped us right to the
                    last minute with the pack out, getting our gear aboard and liaison with the
                    local authorities. It was really extraordinary. Thank God, all of our principal
                    FSNs got out of Eritrea. Mesfun's brother went down to our embassy in Djibouti.
                    The consular assistant went to Khartoum and was hired there in the consular
                    section. Virtually everybody who wanted to get out did. In the last days we made
                    a point of sanitizing of the consulate offices destroying all calendars,
                    schedules, calling cards etc. On the other side of the coin, we did plant some
                    things in our desks. I left papers that looked like codes slipped them into
                    stacks of blank paper. They were from Dungeons and Dragons. Even more lethal
                    than that, out at the Kagnew site we were forced out of, they placed a
                    destruction packet in a closet. This phosphorous blanket, meant to melt a safe,
                    was detonated by a ring on a string. Some guy put the blanket on a high shelf in
                    a closet, and then had the string hanging down like a light cord, thinking that
                    would teach them. We were persuaded that the Soviets were going to come in right
                    after we left to search for intelligence. This motivated us to see to it that we
                    did the most thorough destruction possible. We retrieved about three and a half
                    million dollars worth of equipment; unique classified equipment. We left nothing
                    that they could use.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>In terms of executing our evacuation, I think we all did an excellent job. My
                    only regret was not packing up the CG's silverware, but I did make the
                    Ethiopians sign for the compound. On the very last day, it was a Friday, I made
                    out a receipt for the Consulate and our property. The last C-141 was to take us
                    out that early afternoon. I organized a ceremony formally closing the consulate
                    with our heads up. We had three marines left, and they were in their dress
                    uniforms. We ceremonially lowered the flag. All the FSNs were there, we played
                    the national anthem on a tape recorder. The marines lowered the flag, folded it
                    and they handed it to me and I marched out with it. We then got into a convoy
                    joining the last people from Kagnew and drove down the main streets. People
                    lined the streets to see the Americans leave. Some people were in tears to see
                    the Americans go. In part, they were concerned for themselves, but also, they
                    were sorry to see the end of that relationship which had been a very good one
                    for both sides. We headed to the airport and we said tearful goodbyes to our
                    FSNs on the tarmac, and wishing them the best. We got on the plane and taxied to
                    takeoff. When we were wheels up, we all had a great sense of relief. In that six
                    days of the evacuation I'd probably had a total of ten or 12 hours of sleep.
                    When the plane lifted off there was a great cheer from all the people on board.
                    Off we went to Athens. My one regret was that my wife at this point was assigned
                    in Nairobi. After a few weeks in Athens for debriefings with the embassy and
                    talking to people who came out from DOD, I wanted to try return to the U.S. via
                    Nairobi to see my wife, as we had been married for just six months.
                    Unfortunately, any flight going from Athens to Nairobi went through Addis. So I
                    asked the embassy if they would see if I could get an Ethiopian transit visa. I
                    found out through this effort that I had been PNG'd. I was not allowed even to
                    transit Addis. So, I didn't get to see my wife for another five months. Anyway,
                    I received a presidential letter of commendation and a superior honor award and
                    other recognition. I sent out a final telegram from Asmara explaining what we
                    had done, how our group had operated superbly as a team, and of course, praise
                    for all the help that they'd received from all American agencies. I tried to
                    make our evacuation an exercise we could take some pride in doing professionally
                    and with dignity. I had served in Vietnam and the departure of Americans from
                    Saigon was, I thought, disgraceful, and I just wanted to make sure that we
                    weren't being driven out with our tails between our legs. So we made a proper
                    show of it. Everybody seemed to appreciate the effort that we had made in that
                    regard.</p>
                <p>Closing the consulate and Kagnew station was the end of an era. Ironically, the
                    U.S. is now back in Asmara. We reestablished relations when Eritrea became
                    independent in 1993. We are back in the same compound, which the Eritreans
                    turned back over to us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: AF/E. East Africa. I was fresh out of the horn they figured they could
                    use me in dealing with that region.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Today is August 9, 2002. Keith, 1977 you went back to AFP, what?</p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, AF/E, East African.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: East Africa. What did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, at that time they wanted to take advantage of my experience in
                    the Horn of Africa having been in Ethiopia, now Eritrea. I was assigned to the
                    Sudan desk. It was at a time when our relationship with Sudan was evolving
                    favorably. They wanted someone who had an appreciation of the political dynamics
                    of the Horn of Africa. AF/E at that time was a very vibrant office; there were a
                    lot of very bright young officers in the office, and a lot of hot issues as
                    well. I very much looked forward to the job and I did have a fine assignment
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there from 1977 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: To '79, yes. A full two-year tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the officers you were working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, Dick Post was the first office director, and then Gordon Beyer
                    took over from him. Sam Hamrick, and later Jack Whiting, were the deputies. Lou
                    Janowski was the Kenya desk officer. Bob Illing was the Somali Desk, followed by
                    Gerald Scott. . Dick Baker handled Kenya. Pete Smith, who later resigned from
                    the Service, was the Tanzania Desk Officer. Pat Garland came in to take over the
                    Ethiopia Desk. It was a good crew, a good group of guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you came, you had the Sudan desk, what was the
                        situation with Sudan and what had been sort of the past?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: In our relations with Sudan, the past was weighing on the present, if
                    you will. The past was that there had been the assassination of the American
                    ambassador and his DCM in Khartoum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cleo Noel and Curt Moore?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Moore, yes, exactly. The U.S. orchestrated an effort to compel the
                    Sudanese government, despite pressure from the radical Arabs, to transfer the
                    assassins to Egypt where they were put under house arrest; a very loose kind of
                    confinement. The Sudanese government was disinclined to imprison them in
                    Khartoum because Sudan would be a constant target of radicals seeking the
                    assassins' release. There was a lot of unhappiness about this arrangement, not
                    only in the U.S. government at large, but most particularly in the Foreign
                    Service. As we began the process of improving our bilateral relations and
                    increasing our aid program, we got blowback from the Foreign Service
                    organizations saying they felt it was improper to normalize relations. We
                    responded that it was in the U.S. national interest to do so because of our
                    setback in Ethiopia. These tradeoffs were a reflection of the changing dynamics
                    in that region. Obviously, the Ethiopians had thrown their lot in with the
                    Soviets. As such, there needed to be some degree of balance, and the Sudanese
                    looked to us like they might be able to provide that balance. In addition, the
                    Saudis were pressing on us to improve relations with the Sudanese. They had an
                    interest in stability there. There was a significant Sudanese population in
                    Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis were willing to put money into projects in Sudan.
                    They were particularly interested in developing Sudan's potential to produce
                    food for the Arab world. Sudan has the Nile and had a number of irrigation
                    projects had, in the past, produced cotton. International donors had proposed
                    Sudan consider food instead of cotton. They thought that this food could serve
                    both domestic consumption and the export market.</p>
                <p>Now, Nimeiri, a former general who had taken power by a coup, was a very
                    pragmatic individual. One of the things that earned our respect and commendation
                    was the fact that he made peace with the southern insurgents, who had been
                    engaged in a long festering war. It was one of the objectives that we wanted to
                    see achieved. In doing so, he showed himself to have the ability to control
                    events and to have the wisdom not to allow himself to be swept away by the more
                    radical Islamic elements within previous governments. He co-opted this group by
                    keeping them on the fringe of his own government. He had an inclination toward
                    modernization, so overall he seemed like a good man to back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now had we restored relations by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: We had. By the time I took over we had restored relations, we had sent
                    Don Bergus who had been the DCM in Cairo and an experienced Arabist as
                    Ambassador. Sudan had always been an orphan in terms of where it fit; the Near
                    Eastern and AF bureau. At that particular juncture, we considered it as an
                    African nation for operational purposes, but it was also an Arab, or an Islamic
                    nation, even though there is a very significant Christian/animist in the south
                    of the country. There was a prospect, as we were told by American oil companies,
                    that there would be significant finds of oil in the interior of the country. We
                    also thought that we could help it to transition from a backward agricultural
                    nation to a more modern state; perhaps to fulfill the Saudi vision of becoming
                    the “Breadbasket of the Arab world.” There was some hope that we could
                    participate in that process and that the World Bank and the IMF were willing to
                    help out with our encouragement. European powers were involved, as they wanted
                    to see if we could provide the kind of assistance that would keep Sudan out of
                    the hands of the radicals. We had a variety of activities at that time. A
                    U.S.-Sudanese chamber of commerce had just recently been formed under the U.S.
                    Chamber of Commerce, and I had considerable involvement with them. Tenneco was a
                    major corporation that wanted to become involved in the agro-business in that
                    region. They went to Sudan and met with Nimeiri, who was the most important
                    point of contact. In fact, when I went out to Sudan on my orientation visit, Don
                    Bergus saw to it that I met with Nimeiri, as well. Bergus was a very
                    intelligent, pragmatic fellow, and the idea was that if you want to motivate
                    your desk officer, you take him in to see the chief of state, and let him see
                    for himself what the guy was like. Nimeiri was very soft-spoken with a evident
                    degree of determination to what he thought was right for his country. I was
                    favorably impressed and thought he might well have a shot at successfully making
                    this transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at that point, what about some of the
                        neighbors? What was Libya doing for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, that was one of the reasons why we focused on Sudan, because of
                    our concern about its neighbors. At this particular juncture, Qadhafi was being
                    particularly obstreperous. He was deeply involved in the Chadian insurgency. He
                    was stirring things up in North Africa, in general. He was alternately trying to
                    make friends with Egypt or trying to undermine the Egyptian government. In
                    general, he was throwing his lot in with the most radical Arab elements and was
                    involved financing terrorist activities globally. There was a pro-Libyan faction
                    in Sudan and we were encouraging Nimeiri to keep a close eye on them. There were
                    radicals who would have liked to turn Egypt away from the West. Qadhafi's
                    objective was to undermine Egypt by going through the soft underbelly of Sudan.
                    He attempted to do that through his agents who were Islamic true believers or
                    those who followed of the more radical Islamic approach to government, like the
                    imposition of Sharia. If they had been successful at that time, as it proved to
                    be the case later, it would have thrown the south into rebellion again, which
                    ultimately did occur.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Other players in the region included the Israelis who wanted to see moderate Arab
                    nations encouraged in their moderation. The loss of our strong relationship with
                    Ethiopia had been a big factor in state of flux in the Horn. When Ethiopia threw
                    its lot in with the Soviets, the Somalis decided that, while they had been very
                    close to the Soviets, if the Soviets were going to side with the Ethiopians,
                    then they had to look for new friends. The Somalis had longstanding designs on
                    the Ogaden, region in southeastern Ethiopia. Clearly, with the Soviets backing
                    the Ethiopians, the Somalis' plans were going to be thwarted. While we were
                    trying to build relations with the Somalis, and the AF Bureau was preparing a
                    decision paper to send to the Secretary. Yet we were really not clear in our own
                    minds where we saw this going. Who know what would happen if you threw the U.S.
                    and other western powers behind Somalia. Would that encourage them to move
                    against Ethiopia? Initially we didn't think that was likely. We thought that we
                    could trust Siad Barre, the president, to stand by his word that he had no
                    intention of using force to extend his territorial claims. Of course, there are
                    three areas outside of Somalia they sought to control; Djibouti, parts of
                    northeast Kenya and the Ogaden in southeastern Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking of the five star flag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly right. The original two points are English and Italian
                    Somalia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other three are Ogaden, Djibouti &amp; northeast
                        Kenya.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly. We were concerned about Somali irredentism. Given that this
                    was a tumultuous area we had to navigate fairly carefully. The Carter
                    administration was just coming in. I'd been tossed out in April and my wife was
                    serving in Nairobi. We'd been married less than a year. From Athens I
                    communicated with the embassy Addis and suggested that it would be useful if I
                    could have the opportunity to travel there to debrief on how the evacuation went
                    in Asmara. They thought it was a fine idea. I could then travel on to Nairobi
                    and see my wife and then head back to the United States. They went to the
                    Ethiopian government to get me an entry permit and I found out that I was PNG'd
                    from Ethiopia, so that was that. As a result I didn't see my wife for about
                    seven months, so I went back and set up housekeeping back in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>In any event, I reported to AF/E in June and one of the early issues was the sale
                    of F5s to Sudan. We were considering the sale of just 12 F5s which seemed like a
                    reasonable and modest number. The rationale was for the sale was these aircraft
                    would constitute a minimal deterrent to the Ethiopian air force which the
                    Soviets were beginning to provide significant numbers of aircraft. The Ethiopian
                    air force pilots were a pretty talented group, mostly trained by Americans. The
                    Soviets had supplied almost 100 jet aircraft. The focus of the Ethiopians air
                    force was Somalia which had claims on the Ogaden. There were Sudanese exiles in
                    Ethiopia, and there were Eritrean exiles in Sudan, and there were frequent cross
                    border friction and clashes. We could see these escalating into a wider clash
                    and possibly a clash in the air. We felt that 12 F5s would be just enough to
                    provide a deterrent to any attack, especially one directed at the capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The F5 at the time was considered sort of called the
                        Freedom Fighter I think. It was a very good, but not terribly sophisticated
                        jet plane, which we use to sell to foreign powers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right, it was sort of a standard unit of military assistance that we
                    couldn't provide because we had limited avionics on it so that it couldn't
                    challenge American aircraft, but we were using them in the United States as a
                    replacement for the MIG21 because they had many similar characteristics. They
                    were capable if properly handled and certainly challenged the MIG21s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We used them I think in our training, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's correct, they were always the aggressor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they did have these Soviet characteristics.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, that's right. On the surface of it, Andy Young had signed on as to
                    the Carter administration as their ambassador to the United Nations had passed
                    through Africa having a continuing interest in the region and he had met with
                    Nimeiri and they talked about the sale. Young came back and he said to Carter
                    and to the administration that he thought it was legitimate to sell these F5s. I
                    thought this deal is golden, in addition to which we had a commitment from the
                    Saudis to pay for them. So, it wasn't even a contribution, we would get repaid
                    for the sale of these aircraft which is oftentimes not the case. All the factors
                    had fallen into place and as we began the process of actually working out an
                    export permit for this transaction, we ran into all manner of opposition to it.
                    Ironically, a large part of it came from within the Carter administration at
                    that time. They felt that it was improper and it was reflective of previous
                    Republican administration policies to interject weapons into areas and the
                    concept they said they wanted to retain was not to be the first to interject a
                    new level, a higher level of air capability or any capability, military
                    capability in a given area because that would look like we were encouraging
                    people to escalate the arms race, the regional arms races. We tried to point out
                    that the F-5 was really not an escalation and that the Soviets had already
                    provided the Ethiopians a level of aircraft. The Libyans had the French had
                    purchased French aircraft with their oil money which were much more
                    sophisticated in many ways than the F-5, but we could not move this thing. It
                    went on interminably; I came to AF/E in June and the issue had just been
                    initiated and it was still going on after I left two years later. The
                    transaction was never concluded by which time the Saudis had withdrawn their
                    offer to pay for the aircraft. So, then we had to do it under an FMS program.
                    Sudan is one of the poorest nations in the world and the great miraculous
                    transformation has never occurred in Sudan. It certainly wasn't on the horizon
                    two years later, and their having to pay for the F-5s was just not rational.</p>
                <p>It was kind of indicative of how things went in that administration. Here you
                    have Andy Young and the president conceptually, saying this sounds like a
                    reasonable thing to do, and at two years later you still don't get it done. Now,
                    eventually the transaction was concluded, by which time the Ethiopians had
                    overwhelming air superiority, but thank God, the conditions on the ground never
                    led to clashes that would have brought both nations to their knees.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where within the Carter administration was the opposition
                        coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, I'll tell you from the human rights people. I'm trying to think
                    of the woman.</p>
                <p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Patt Derian, yes, her representatives and AID people as well. AID types
                    thought that our assistance ought to be exclusively developmental variety which
                    is fine in its own way, but we didn't see them understanding the threats in the
                    immediate region. In point of fact, 12 aircraft are not going to change the
                    balance of power in the Horn. We tried to make that case over and over again,
                    but they just felt it was symbolically wrong to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you thinking of the aircraft in a way of being
                        symbolically like a security blanket or something? It wouldn't change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, a deterrent. It would not have changed anything militarily. They
                    were too few in number to be used aggressively. At this particular evolution in
                    the Carter administration, and it may have occurred under the Nixon
                    administration, when a sale was challenged by Congress, State and DOD came up
                    with this concept of defensive military assistance. So you ask yourself, what's
                    defensive military assistance? Well, its things like anti-tank weapons, its
                    anti-aircraft weapons, anti-aircraft missiles. All well and good. Obviously,
                    these all can be used in an offensive role if you choose to do so. But that is
                    for example what we were talking about in Somalia. We wanted to back the Somalia
                    regime, but in a manner that would not give them any signal that we would
                    support their assuming an aggressive role. Likewise, these F-5 aircraft didn't
                    have a long-range capability to operate over Ethiopia for any period of time,
                    but they could serve well as a local air defense capability of the capital
                    regime and the Nile Valley. But even that argument failed in these various
                    councils on Sudan. We couldn't get these people to understand the limited nature
                    of this modest military sale. They kept coming back to the symbolism and we kept
                    trying to hammer in the realities of the situation. When the transaction
                    eventually occurred, it was in the most disadvantageous way for both the U.S.
                    and Sudan. It was a foreign military sale, for which we were never paid back
                    because then the regime changed. They abrogated their predecessors'
                    responsibilities, and the aircraft fell onto disrepair, by which time Ethiopia
                    was preoccupied with its internal problems. There was no longer the threat that
                    there appeared to have been before. Now, maybe we didn't need to do it at all,
                    but the sense was that in order to secure and maintain a relationship with
                    Nimeiri and his military leaders it was important to give them a sense that we
                    were (a) behind them in the transition process, and (b) providing them this
                    minimal deterrent. That was the rationale we tried to use with very limited
                    success. It seemed that we could win some of the various battles, but we seemed
                    to be losing the war. Each time we would seem to persuade certain representative
                    of human rights and AID, it would get blocked somewhere else. Then we'd have to
                    go back to square one and start over. It's sort of indicative of how things
                    operated in the early Carter days, and to some extent throughout the
                    administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>There is another incident, which I'd like to record, although I was only on the
                    periphery of this, but I certainly was an observer. In the early Carter days one
                    of the things he insisted that we do was to be open to the press. So, for
                    example, AF/P, the public affairs office, would route telephone inquiries from
                    the press directly to desk officers. This had never been the case before. They
                    would be provided guidance and they would try to respond to the extent they
                    could. So, we were often times confronted by press people asking about certain
                    specific issues. Carter himself was as good as his word in this concept. He
                    invited, I think it was Time Magazine correspondent, to spend the day with the
                    president in the Oval Office. He would have complete access to the White House
                    and the president's schedule, and would sit in on the president's meetings. One
                    of the documents that crossed the president's desk that day was a NSDM about our
                    policy on the Horn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: NSDM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: National Security Decision Memorandum. The subject was shifting our
                    alliances away from Ethiopia, where it had essentially been booted out, toward
                    Somalia. The idea was to try to provide the Somalis a level of military
                    capability to defend against a rearming Ethiopia. The Ethiopians had many
                    grievances against the Somalis and there was constant friction along the border.
                    So, we proposed that we would provide Somalia defensive weapons. The president
                    allowed the reporter look over his shoulder, and the substance of the NSDM made
                    it into the Time article. Somalis read Time and they learned that the United
                    States was going to sift its support to them. Now, granted, we had told them to
                    a certain extent what we proposed to do. But, they thought, the U.S. will back
                    us in all things. At least that's how they interpreted it. In a matter of six
                    weeks or so thereafter they launched an attack into the Ogaden. I don't think
                    that they had received any of our weapons by that time, but they had what they
                    had received from the Soviets. They figured the sooner we move the better
                    because the Soviets have not yet provided that much military wherewithal to the
                    Ethiopians. So, they attacked. We had egg all over our face because they had
                    apparently misinterpreted the NSDM and they saw an envelope of time in which
                    they had to act, if they were ever going to act at all. So, they did. They
                    quickly occupied a large part of the Ogaden. Their actions accelerated the
                    Soviet response, and the Soviets brought in more weaponry, and military advisors
                    and eventually Cuban troops. They had three brigades of Cuban troops as the
                    spearhead; we figured about 15,000 Cuban troops. They drove the Somalis back out
                    of the Ogaden over the next several months making the whole region much more
                    unstable. Of course, now we are stuck with the Somalis who have just been badly
                    clobbered in the Ogaden for this rash involvement. Ethiopia has ten times, well,
                    not quite, maybe eight times as many people as Somalia. It's not going to be a
                    fair fight at the best of times. Not that that would have deterred the Somalis,
                    but it weakened their government and it led to its eventual collapse
                    thereafter.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>In any event, we had decided that we had wanted to continue to play a role in the
                    Horn. It was important to back that up with assistance that would give people
                    some degree of assurance that we're not just making verbal commitments, but were
                    prepared to follow up with both military and development assistance. Sudan was
                    to be a player in that effort on the Horn as well. For the remainder of my time
                    in AF/E we were involved in a variety of opportunities to try to set up
                    commercial relationships, and cultural relationships with Sudan, and to fend off
                    the radical elements that were there. In point of fact, during my visit to
                    Khartoum I saw Sadie al Mahdi, a leader of the former regime, who was one
                    considered to be the radical bad guys. He'd been allowed to return home, but he
                    was sort of under close surveillance by the government. Because of his
                    following, Nimeiri felt that he couldn't quash him altogether. They had to
                    accord him some degree of respect, which they did. Of course, he later came to
                    power and Turabi, of the Muslim Brotherhood, became the philosopher of the
                    fundamentalist regime. I saw him as well, a very bright guy, a very capable guy.
                    He was educated in the West, but very dedicated to the Islamic cause. In any
                    event, Nimeiri tried to play this right, he tried to not crush these people, but
                    at the same time keep a close eye on them so they not get the upper hand. Of
                    course, in the long-term it did Nimeiri in. The military people they put in were
                    more radical in orientation then Nimeiri. I thought our approach to Sudan was
                    quite a reasonable given the situation. Maybe we oversold the concept of the
                    breadbasket, more than was warranted. Sudanese infrastructure was very weak and
                    when they did find oil in Darfur province in the west central region. It's far
                    away from anywhere, and of course building a pipeline from the wells to Port
                    Sudan would be a logistical nightmare. There was another massive project being
                    contemplated to shift Nile water from Sudan to Saudi Arabia. Water had always
                    been a critical element in Saudi Arabia. They talked about building a pipeline
                    from the Nile across the desert to the coast, and then pipe it across the Red
                    Sea and bring it to Saudi Arabia. Needless to say, nothing ever came of that,
                    the symbolism of shipping water from Sudan to Saudi Arabia would be
                    disastrous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Egyptians would probably howl, too, wouldn't

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: They would. The whole flow of the Nile is critical.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. As the Egyptians became more moderate in their approach to Israel
                    and expressed their willingness to talk with the Israelis, the more important
                    Sudan was to protect Egypt's southern flank from Arab radicals.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were there during the Camp David process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The visit to Jerusalem with Sadat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly. As a result, there was a sense that we had an obligation to
                    protect Egypt's southern flank from Qadhafi. As a result the Egyptians also
                    understood this. If you go back in history, the Egyptians and the British in
                    colonial times always felt Sudan was vulnerable to outside pressure, you recall
                    the Fashoda incident, and it was susceptible to manipulation by radicals. So the
                    Egyptians encouraged us to play this role. They didn't have the wherewithal
                    beyond some technical assistance that they could put into the pot, but they
                    wanted very much that we play a role to keep things quiet. This was one more
                    source of pressure on us. So, when you looked at it, it was in our own interest
                    to maintain stability in the region as the equation between Ethiopia and Somalia
                    was shifting. You had the Qadhafi dimension, the Egyptians interest in
                    stability, and the Israelis looking for a moderate regime as well. So, all of
                    this militated that we become more aggressive in our overtures. Our assistance
                    program went from about $10 million to a projected $100 million a year, which
                    would have made it one of the largest programs in Africa. I don't think that it
                    ever reached that level, but that was the direction that we certainly were
                    headed.</p>
                <p>The Sudanese account was very interesting, but while I was handling that, the
                    office decided that I should also take over Uganda at least as far as the issue
                    of emergency evacuation because of my experience in Asmara. Idi Amin had been a
                    problem for us for some time. We had closed our embassy in Kampala in 1973, when
                    Amin was becoming increasingly obstreperous. There had been threats and
                    incidents against Peace Corps volunteers, and they had been removed. After that
                    there was an incident involving embassy personnel in which they were clearly
                    threatened. Idi Amin's government did nothing to protect our people. So, we
                    closed down. Now, at this time the Uganda account was pretty quiet, there wasn't
                    much going on in Uganda and it was just as well. Idi Amin was doing all manner
                    of outrageous things hoping to provoke a media reaction. . He was viewed as a
                    clown on the periphery of the process. While there some regional concerns like
                    the southern Sudanese insurgents who had taken refuge in Uganda, it was never a
                    significant issue. There were opponents of Amin who had been taken refuge in
                    Sudan and in Ethiopia as well, but they posed no threat to stability. Despite
                    this, the volatility of the regime and the growing hostility of his neighbors,
                    it made sense to review the entire E &amp; E plan for Uganda. So, I was tasked
                    to do that. Our protecting power was West Germany, so I went to Bonn with a
                    small delegation and met with the German officials. We worked on the plans and
                    tried to determine whether they were realistic.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: We had about 250 missionaries constituting most of the American
                    presence. There were a few odd teachers and dual nationals, but basically it was
                    the missionaries. They had been advised that we did not think it was wise to
                    remain in Uganda, and they knew that and they made their according to their
                    consciences Our focus was on how we would get them out. We were in contact with
                    the missionary organizations here in the U.S. We had a reasonable idea what
                    their numbers and locations. They were pretty good at keeping us apprized of
                    changes if they took people out and moved people in. They were uncomfortable
                    working with our government on the one hand, while on the other they had made
                    this commitment apart from our concerns. The missionaries knew what was going on
                    in general terms, and thought they could get along with Amin's folks, and that
                    the U.S. would protect them if Amin went bonkers. We weren't so sure. So, after
                    the stop in Bonn, we went to Nairobi and met with the German and French
                    ambassadors resident in Kampala, and several other foreign residents, to find
                    out about the situation in Kampala and the country at large. The German
                    ambassador was fairly pragmatic and he said there were terrible things going on.
                    The French ambassador, by contrast, seemed almost oblivious to the atrocities.
                    He said he lived not far from the central prison. He said, yes, at nighttime you
                    heard people screaming, but said, “I just turn the air conditioner up.” He
                    didn't know what all the fuss was about. Of course, after the fall of Amin, we
                    found out a great deal more about the atrocities he had committed. But the
                    French ambassador seemed not to want to know about it. Nonetheless, they gave us
                    useful information and promised assistance in terms of communication and, to
                    some extent, support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the German and French having trouble with their
                        citizens or did Idi Amin only pick on the American Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He picked on the Americans because we had suspended relations and were
                    unfriendly to him. In addition, there was a Congressional effort to impose an
                    embargo on Uganda. The more provocative he became, the more American politicians
                    saw an opportunity to make some hay because who is ever going to support Idi
                    Amin? Don Pease of Ohio, who I see recently died, took up this legislation.
                    Pease was like a country school teacher in a lot of ways and in the world there
                    were either rights or wrongs, or at least that's how he played this. He thought
                    Idi Amin was a bad man, which Idi Amin definitely was. So he felt that there
                    should be a legislatively imposed embargo. They felt that the administration's
                    willingness to acknowledge Amin, or even tolerate his existence was
                    unacceptable, and that we ought to hurry the collapse of his government by
                    imposing embargoes. The U.S. should suspend commerce and restrict Americans from
                    moving in and out of the country. Department representatives testified against
                    this effort, and got clobbered by this congressman from New York, a very bright
                    guy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Did you? He took apart Bill Harrop, who was the PDAS in AF at that
                    time, about State Department policy. He drew parallels to State Department's
                    failure in the pre-war period, when Jews were being killed in Germany while we
                    sat idly by. I thought to myself, this is so outrageous. I had carefully
                    prepared Harrop's testimony. I had tried to stick to the legal and policy
                    aspects of a Uganda embargo, but, all of a sudden we were being crucified by
                    what predecessors two generations removed had done. Then afterwards Solarz and
                    Harrop, who knew each other quite well because Solarz had a special interest in
                    Africa, were all buddy-buddy. Solarz just had to exploit this issue in his
                    report to his constituents that he beat up State for its past sins. I, as a
                    relatively naive young man, thought to myself, this is so God-damned outrageous.
                    Of course, he's grandstanding for the purpose of having it appear on the
                    congressional record. He's taking us to task where the parallels were
                    nonexistent.</p>
                <p>One of the things we tried to explain to Congress was that, if you legislatively
                    impose this embargo, when the day comes, which it probably will given the
                    fragility of this regime, you're going to have to pass legislation to remove it
                    and it's going to take a long time. The much more effective way of achieving
                    it's goal was to have it as an executive order which can be lifted by the stroke
                    of a pen. We said we were looking into how we would do that, but the Congress
                    was absolutely unmoved. They had their teeth into this one and they weren't
                    going to let go. Sure enough they passed the Goddamn embargo. Sure enough within
                    months thereafter, having no relationship at all to the embargo, Idi Amin's
                    troops got in trouble with Tanzania, which invaded and Idi Amin was overthrown.
                    While we had closed our embassy in Kampala, we did not break relations.
                    Therefore the Ugandans had representation at the Charg� level in the U.S.
                    because it was a nice place to be, and they wanted to keep tabs on U.S. policy.
                    The Congress held three days of hearings. It was typical congressional show. The
                    first day they had a lot of academics and the academics would tell you the
                    history and background of the present situation. The second day was the good
                    stuff where they had the Uganda victims testify about all Amin's horrendous
                    atrocities. For example, about how they lined these people up and each guy had
                    to batter out the brains of the next one in line. Somebody else said they
                    drilled a hole in his stomach and they put a firecracker in his stomach. There
                    were all kinds of atrocious tales to get the headlines and their political
                    juices flowing. Of course the piece de resistance was Bill Harrop. He was the
                    last to testify. He followed Commerce and AID representatives who were
                    noncommittal on the embargo. Eventually they got to Bill Harrop and he was
                    clearly the main course. They scrubbed his head from the beginning. He barely
                    started reading his statement when they said, “We'll enter that into the
                    record,” now answer this question. They started hammering on him about all the
                    atrocities and how could the U.S. defend Amin. They got what they wanted; media
                    profile. Idi Amin was definitely a bad actor, and there wasn't going to be
                    anybody standing up for him except the hapless State Department that only wanted
                    some rationality in our policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>In any event, what brought Amin down was a border conflict in the southwestern
                    part of Uganda on the Agar River. The Ugandans alleged that some local Tanzanian
                    farmers had come across the border and stolen some cattle. The Ugandans
                    organized an attack across the Kagera and stole back cattle and anything else
                    there was to steal. The conflict exploded into charges and the counter charges
                    as who had started it. Then the Tanzanian army slowly and methodically organized
                    a punitive expedition against the Ugandans in the immediate area where this
                    incident had taken place. They were going to cross the Kagera River and go to
                    the town of Mbarara, about 25 or 30 miles from the border. They made it to this
                    town with little resistance and burned and dynamited it to the ground. In that
                    process they realized that the Ugandan army, once well trained, had degenerated
                    to a bunch of thugs. They didn't have any military cohesion, and were no longer
                    an organized military force. So, the Tanzanian army stopped in this town that
                    they had destroyed and came to realize that they could take this all the way to
                    Kampala and overthrow Amin and solve that problem once and for all. They
                    reorganized and resupplied themselves, and then started a slow, very methodical,
                    very African advance toward Kampala. They brought to bear their artillery, which
                    would lay down in a barrage for a day or so and then they'd slowly advance to
                    see what was left. They'd find that the Ugandans had long since withdrawn, and
                    the Tanzanians would repeat the process. In this way they progressively moved
                    forward toward Kampala. Finally, as the approached the capital, they began to
                    realize that there were all kinds of possibilities now. Coming from the
                    southwest, there were two avenues, one toward Kampala and the other toward
                    Entebbe and the airport. At the point about 25 or 30 miles between the two, they
                    would make a rush for the two objectives. They were able to do this because by
                    now the Ugandan army had collapsed completely. They advanced for the capital and
                    hoped that with the others going to Entebbe, they would catch Idi Amin before he
                    could fly out with all of his treasure. But Amin beat them and he flew off to
                    Libya. The Tanzanians had taken the capita and the airport, and they basically
                    had thrown the rascal out. They went to the central prison and they found the
                    execution grounds. Among other things, they found buckets full of heads and many
                    corpses. At Idi Amin's residence they found a refrigerator with the heads of
                    people who had been his opponents. He had them in the freezer and allegedly he
                    used periodically take the heads out and lecture them on their misdeeds.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, as this process of Idi Amin's downfall was unfolding, Ugandan exiles
                    came to AF/E wanting to discuss the successor government. Godfrey Binaisa, the
                    former attorney general under Obote, was among them. There were three or four
                    serious contenders. Binaisa came in with a group of five or six retainers. He
                    started out by asking for American military assistance. He wanted arms, military
                    training, aircraft and anti-aircraft weapons, and, of course, he needed money. I
                    said I didn't see how we could meet his needs. We did not agree to do any of
                    this. Their demands began to winnow down and they said they were absolutely
                    determined to return to Uganda when the government collapsed. We wished them the
                    best of luck. I suspected they had already received assistance from other
                    groups. Finally after about an hour of discussion, recognizing that they were
                    not going to get anything out of us in a tangible form, they asked if they could
                    we get visas to re-enter the U.S. in case their endeavors didn't work. I
                    thought, now there's a serious level of commitment. But in point of fact,
                    Binaisa did go to Uganda and, while he wasn't initially made chief of state,
                    later on he did serve as president of the country for a period of about two
                    years and was then pushed out by someone else. He was a relatively decent guy.
                    He was educated in the UK and seemed to have his head screwed on properly.
                    Basically he was looking for a boost to give his faction the edge over the
                    others. In any event, Idi Amin was driven out, a new government comes in and we
                    have the struggle to try to restore assistance to Uganda by obtaining the repeal
                    of the legislatively imposed embargo. Congress said, yes, we see that, that's
                    fine. Could you tell us about the new government? We told them what we could.
                    They said, okay, that's fine, but we've got a legislative bill, then we have to
                    put it on the calendar, it has to go through the committee, it has to go to the
                    floor, etc. It took the Congress six months to lift the embargo so we couldn't
                    provide assistance to the needy Ugandans during this time, precisely as we had
                    testified would be the case if they went ahead with the embargo, which, of
                    course, they did. We thought we were on the side of angels in doing what we had
                    and found out that we were just hapless victims of a Kabuki theater that
                    Congress devised for us to play.</p>

                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Pease. Yes, there were several of them as a matter of fact. What their
                    job seemed to be was to identify and feed to their congressmen issues, in this
                    instance in Africa, that would have no downside risk and should return maximum
                    favorable publicity. I remember a couple of staffers who were intense about it,
                    but it seemed that Peace himself was personally driven on this issue. As I say,
                    on a certain level, the embargo makes sense. On a more sophisticated level,
                    there are downsides and they were just not listening to them. They were not
                    prepared to accept them. We had done our best and the U.S. did have a reasonably
                    good relationship with the successor government and eventually were able to
                    provide assistance. There were no other issues, economic or commercial that we
                    needed to quickly resolve. Strategically speaking, Uganda's frontier areas were
                    pretty remote and didn't cause a threat to their neighbors. Of continuing
                    concern was clashes among tribal groups and whether they would take umbrage at
                    whoever got control. That's always been a concern in Africa, and the military
                    leader was always a sort of compromise candidate because their first loyalty was
                    thought to be to the military, and then secondarily to the tribal,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with the Tanzanian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Remarkably not very much. There are ironies in the Tanzanians playing
                    the role of aggressor against their neighbor. I mean Nyerere had always been an
                    international socialist and a person who believed in the socialist principals
                    and non-aggression. He was a perpetual critic of the West and of capitalism,
                    part of the imperial “hangover” if you will. The successor government, he was no
                    longer the chief of state by that time, although he still had considerable
                    influence, to do this was remarkable. Practically speaking, Amin was a pain in
                    everybody's side and it served all the nations in the region purposes to get rid
                    of him. Tanzania just happened, just by fate of history, to be the instrument
                    for that process. As I say, their military performance wasn't dazzling, but it
                    was adequate because the reality was that Amin's army was useless as a fighting
                    force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they didn't get in there and begin to get hungry or
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, remarkably, the Tanzanians pretty much wanted to turn the country
                    over to its people. They had their own candidates to take power, who would be
                    friendlier to them, but they didn't they stay on. They allowed the successor
                    regime to come in, and went home, which is impressive. This is in marked
                    contrast in recent events in central Africa with the Rwandans being in the
                    former Zaire. Tanzania was at least faithful to its principles to that extent,
                    that they didn't see themselves remaining as an occupying force and manipulating
                    the successor regime in Kampala. We were pleased by that. Our relationship with
                    the Tanzanian government wasn't all that great. I mean it was okay.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Exactly. You know, the Tanzanians would listen to us, they were always
                    reasonably friendly. But we had tried to block some of their candidates for
                    leadership in international organizations because their orientation ran contrary
                    to our perspective on the world. As a result the relationship was cool, but
                    correct. When we would ask them about the situation in Uganda, they'd give us
                    just about what they'd give the press and not much more.</p>

                        that sort of the other side of the moon or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, not entirely. We were aware of it because there were a lot of
                    American missionaries in the south. There was a Christian-animist mix. There
                    have been some very promising people coming from that region who came to the
                    U.S. For instance, Francis Deng. He was and may still be a professor at Yale
                    University, and he was for a brief period an senior official in the Sudanese
                    government under Nimeiri as part of his reunification effort and rapprochement
                    with the south. He did put some southerners into positions of responsibility.
                    Juba, the southern capital is pretty hard to get to, I mean it's on the Nile,
                    but in the swamp regions. We had missionaries in various parts of the region. We
                    also had an AID relief operation that operated out of there for food assistance
                    primarily, but it also pursued some level of development as well. There were
                    refugees from the previous period of fighting with the Islamic north. There were
                    significant populations who were in parts of Uganda and Ethiopia as well. There
                    were liberation groups that operated out of parts of southwestern Ethiopia. Then
                    even after Nimeiri's peace settlement, there were elements in the south that
                    were still opposed to Khartoum. They wanted succession. We studied that option
                    because there were a number of people promoting the concept, especially friends
                    of the missionary community both in the U.S. and elsewhere, but you couldn't
                    imagine a more hapless entity that an independent south. They'd be completely
                    landlocked, and, while there was a potential for agriculture in the fertile
                    flood plain of the Nile, there were no roads. Agricultural inputs would have
                    been extraordinarily difficult to bring in and where would they ship their
                    product from? We encouraged southerners to see their fate as tied to a moderate
                    Islamic government in Khartoum as their best outcome ultimately.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was a very tricky business because we were developing a close
                    relationship with Nimeiri, but we received some emissaries on behalf of these
                    groups through missionaries. Likewise I believe our embassy in Nairobi had some
                    contact with these groups as well. Because we wanted to keep tabs on them and
                    you can't just ignore the missionaries either. They always have an influence.
                    They also have knowledge on the ground that a few other people have. We were not
                    unaware of these groups, but these were not at the forefront of our interests
                    because this would compete with our regional strategic objectives. The
                    southerners concerns fell very far short in terms our interest in supporting a
                    moderate Islamic state, particularly given our concerns about Egypt and
                    Libya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there sort of a feeling within the State
                        Department, things were beginning to open up because we are talking about
                        Sadat going to Israel, Camp David, you know, I mean it looked like you're
                        going to end up with peace in the Middle East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, it's part of our considerations as what we wanted to promote
                    modern governments and sustain them by giving them the economic wherewithal to
                    keep their people happy, and the Nimeiri seemed to have the characteristics that
                    we were looking for in that regard. He was not only a moderate, but a guy who
                    understood the value of making peace even thought there were critics when he
                    did. He was able to take them on. Essentially, he seemed to have all the
                    apparent ability to bring about the economic development of his country. He was
                    committed to the idea. All African leaders, to a certain extent or other, have
                    this tremendous temptation to become corrupt. He seemed less inclined to give in
                    to that than many of the others. His lifestyle was modest. Now, I'm not saying
                    there wasn't some back channel of funds to him, but he didn't flaunt the fact
                    that he was the chief of state. He was no Mobutu or anything like that. He
                    seemed like just the kind of leader that we could work with. Other moderate
                    leaders in the region also felt that was the case. As I say, the Saudis were big
                    backers of Nimeiri and his approach to things.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, the Falashas are the black Jews of Ethiopia. They became a concern
                    to us when the socialists and Marxist Leninist government in Addis started
                    considering them as potential subversives and they became quite harsh in dealing
                    with them and then the Israelis were successful in getting the American Jewish
                    community and the international Jewish community to support their cause. They
                    were being subjected to human rights abuses and eventually there was an airlift
                    to bring them out to Israel.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No. My two accounts, Sudan and Uganda, kept me plenty busy. The big
                    issue in AF/E was the Ethiopia-Somalia conflict. The idea that the Soviets would
                    aggressively assist Ethiopia militarily and that the Cubans would provide three
                    brigades of infantry to fight a battle in Africa was a potential president for
                    some very serious instability and great power conflict..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, who was the assistant secretary for African affairs

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Let's see, Schaufele was there initially, and he was replaced by . .

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Dick Moose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's right. That's quite a story in its own right, specifically
                    regarding the F-5s for Sudan. Dick Moose, as people who were in the Department
                    at that time recall, was appointed by the Carter administration first as the
                    Undersecretary for Management and he filled that job for something like three
                    months. Rumor had it, as it came down to us troops on the AF desks that his
                    tenure as M had not been successful. He was reportedly asked by the Secretary
                    what other job he would prefer in the Department. He had done a tour as, he was
                    an O3 economic/commercial officer in Bangui, so he apparently asked for the
                    African bureau, and that's where he ended up. Dick Moose came to the first staff
                    meeting, and I remember this remarkably well, because it happened that he
                    commented on something that I was right in the midst of. He was a true
                    reflection of the early Carter administration. He was one of several former
                    Foreign Service officers appointed to senior positions, Tony Lake being
                    another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim Lowenstein.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. They had all been critical of the Nixon administration's
                    involvement in Vietnam, particularly over the Cambodian invasion. At various
                    points they had resigned in protest, and now they were back. Moose was a
                    reflection of that group. So, at the first bureau-wide staff meeting he attends,
                    he outlines in this sort of touchy feely way, his view of what our policy to
                    Africa should be. He was remarkable also for his penchant for wearing casual
                    clothes. He would show up in blue jeans and a work shirt like shirt you get at
                    Sears. We were amazed and amused. He said he thought that we ought to have a
                    very interested and active, yet benign approach to Africa. We should be very
                    concerned about the potential for further military takeover of governments. We
                    ought to promote the democratic process and encourage democratic movements. Then
                    he said we shouldn't be too quick to approve the sale of military hardware such
                    as aircraft to areas in which they haven't before been introduced. So, here's
                    the head of your own bureau saying that he has serious reservations about the
                    F-5 program. The irony being, that, ultimately he signed on to the F-5 sale,
                    seeing it as a modest contribution to regional stability. More ironic, toward
                    the end of his tenure under the Carter administration, we were up to our ears in
                    trouble in Liberia shoring up the Doe regime. He had to travel repeatedly to
                    Monrovia and then to report to Congress saying we had to provide Samuel Doe more
                    military assistance to fend off the Libyan backed subversive elements that are
                    threatening his regime</p>

                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, he wasn't. We'll hear more about that because I was the DCM in
                    Doe's waning years in Liberia. As I say, I had an excellent tour in AF/E, a good
                    group of people, a lot of high profile issues that grabbed the attention of the
                    front office and I had a great time. Lots of changes happened in my accounts
                    during that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there in the African bureau would you say that by this
                        time the bloom was well off the rose, do you know what I mean? During the
                        '60s Africa was, it was a new day dawning, fresh winds from the subcontinent
                        and all that, were the African hands, were they realists, I mean, how would
                        you describe them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, well, it's an excellent question because we had evolved in our
                    views. In the immediate post-independence period we had programs that were going
                    to be responsive to the needs of all the countries. We set up embassies
                    everywhere, and then after a while we saw the incredible inefficiencies of these
                    governments, and we reduced the number of “focus” countries to ten, to include
                    Nigeria. They got into some kind of a snit with us, and they told us we could
                    take our AID and shove it. So, we were down to nine countries. Then we began to
                    have a regional approach to aid, and we began to expand our activities, and have
                    individual programs again. But the frustration, both on the economic development
                    and the political levels, the civilian governments in the immediate post
                    independence period were increasingly being replaced by military governments.
                    The military governments showed themselves to be both ineffectual and corrupt.
                    Eventually these leaders were pushed out either by other military leaders or by
                    popular movements, which forced the military to cede power back to civilian
                    authority. By 1977, the bloom was not only off the rose, we considered ourselves
                    to be much more pragmatic about the African reality, but we still felt there was
                    a lot of potential there. This potential was the tremendous amount of natural
                    resources in the region. Even the Africans leaders themselves were beginning
                    slowly to realize that you cannot just plunder these countries. Resources are
                    finite, and now having squandered whatever they had inherited from the colonial
                    powers, now was the time to start creating something on their own. We hoped that
                    they could broaden economic development from a concessional approach, such as
                    existed in Guinea where the American and multinational mining companies strip
                    mined bauxite and exported it through its enclave port and contributed little to
                    the regional economy. There should be a broader range of benefits available to
                    Africans as a result of the capitalist corporations exploiting the natural
                    resources, but no spreading the wealth. One contribution to that process would
                    be in developing people of talent and ability who would then take over positions
                    of responsibility in government and industry. Just the general lifting of all
                    boats by the increasing the economic prosperity derived from exploiting these
                    resources. We still believed that this was possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Now, at the same time, looking at Sudan in particular, our policy was also driven
                    by external considerations, particularly Near East considerations. So, this
                    concept of the “Breadbasket of the Arab world,” which we promoted, we recognized
                    was a long shot, but it was possible. If the Americans ran it, we could make it
                    happen, but could the Sudanese make it happen? There was a good deal less
                    optimistic on that score, but the concept was still valid. I remember Don Bergus
                    talking about that and as a true Arab hand without any bleeding heart
                    tendencies. He said if things go badly, the Sudanese can at least eat the wheat
                    which they can't do with cotton. If they produce cotton they are completely
                    dependent on world prices. He felt there was a logic shifting agricultural
                    production in that direction even if it didn't have a great impact on Sudan's
                    export market or in the Arab world. That made sense to me. They grew this long
                    staple cotton, which is very desirable, but the prices were dependent on world
                    production, the cost of inputs and weather. The Sudanese were completely
                    vulnerable on this score. I think that we all learned a fair amount. While we
                    were always a bit cynical, yet we maintained our optimism. Those of us in the
                    African bureau in the '80s and later recognized that all the socialist models
                    that Africans adopted post-independence were garbage and had set back Africa for
                    years. At the same time the Soviet Union is falling apart, so that model
                    crumbled. The stress was then on free enterprise and the democratic process and
                    the benefits that derive from them. We began to evolve with this transformation,
                    but we were still cynical, but optimistic and hopeful that good things could
                    happen.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. In addition, the cultural constraints that you find in regions
                    such as Asia are not as strong in Africa. I remember when I was in Chad, we were
                    tasked how do you get nomadic herders to commercialize their cattle? Their
                    cattle were their wealth and their prestige. It was their Mercedes Benz. We
                    explained to them that there was a market for their cattle in coastal Africa
                    where you can't raise cattle because of the Tsetse fly. They would be willing to
                    pay you good money for your cattle. The herders resisted. For them, every cow
                    they had made them a more important person. How do you deal with that? That was
                    about the worst of the cultural constraints we faced, and donors found a
                    mechanism to get them to sell a small percentage of their herd by promising to
                    decrease their losses from disease. The point is that in Asia you find yourself
                    confronting several millennia of cultural constraints. We thought of Africa as a
                    region where, given its struggle to find an identity and the continuing tribal
                    conflict, if they could achieve a bit more prosperity and opportunity, and
                    education for their kids, that we could offer formulas that would allow them to
                    have those things, and that the tribal frictions would melt away over time if
                    they could benefit from democracy and economic opportunity. There were many
                    examples indicating that urbanization in Africa could lead to a breakdown in
                    tribal conflict, but such integration was never complete. Tribalism was always a
                    factor, always in the background, and if Africa is ever going to succeed, it's
                    got to have viable institutions that transcend tribalism, and to be able to feed
                    itself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '79, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: '79, okay, I was in AF/E and Ambassador Ann Holloway who was a prot�g�e
                    of Andy Young, she ran in Andy Young's Washington office, told Dick Moose she
                    needed somebody to go out as her DCM in Mali. Ann had actually been proposed for
                    another African mission but insisted that she knew Mali was available and that's
                    where she wanted to go because of its cultural uniqueness. It's known in French
                    as “le berceau de la civilasation de l'Afrique de la Ouest,” the cradle of West
                    African civilization. Ann wanted to go to a place that was culturally
                    interesting as well as politically active. They gave my name to her. I talked to
                    her and said I'd be very interested in going. It was an O-1 level job. I was
                    recently minted O-2, but I was married to a Foreign Service officer in my own
                    right. I proposed that as a condition of accepting, we would have to see if
                    there was some opportunity for my wife to work as well. Fortunately, there was a
                    joint administrative office, JAO, which was staffed primarily by State officers.
                    As such, my wife could work in that operation and we could have the necessary
                    cutouts in terms of rating and reviewing officer. Ann said she thought that a
                    JAO assignment could be worked out, and the deal was done.</p>

                <p>I went to Bamako on the regular rotation in 1979. Pat Byrne was the outgoing
                    Ambassador, and I replaced a fellow who I had actually worked for in Hong Kong.
                    He had a very different management style than me. The most striking thing about
                    Bamako was its very large AID mission for a relatively modest and low-profile
                    post. Just to give you an idea, we had an AID program of $16 million and we had
                    42 direct-hire AID employees, plus seven regional employees that were based out
                    of Bamako. On top of that, there were another 50 American and TCN contract
                    employees. If you calculate out the cost to support an AID family in Bamako, it
                    worked out to be more than half of the $16 million that was going just to the
                    support of this bloated staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a real problem, isn't it? The tale, which is an

                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. Sure we are providing technical assistance to a certain
                    extent, but in virtually every case these people are simply project
                    administrators. None of the direct-hires lived outside the capital. They only
                    occasionally traveled to the interior; perhaps two or three times a year. Their
                    families all had to have proper accommodations, and that's fine, but when you
                    calculate it out this cost was a very significant part of the whole USAID
                    program. In terms of the material assistance, that was by far the lesser half of
                    our assistance. In this instance the oversized mission was attributable to the
                    AID mission director. He was a very aggressive administrator, a bureaucratic
                    gamesman and a flat-out empire builder. For example, the regional AID office in
                    Abidjan, REDSO, was supposed to support Bamako. Our AID Director demanded his
                    own engineer, lawyer, etc. He had remarkable success in getting his own people
                    on staff. The regional seven man office was related to a West African
                    organization based in Abidjan, and they were supposedly providing technical
                    assistance to the other member nations. Even so, 49 USAID direct-hires, when the
                    State complement was about 19 is an exceptional situation. We had a Peace Corps
                    program with staff and there were two people at the U.S. Information Agency.
                    Otherwise the U.S. Mission was fairly standard for a Sahelian African post. The
                    USAID mission was disproportionate, and it had its own office compound. In part,
                    it was because the host government had shown a willingness to commit itself to
                    economic development. Mali was certainly no great friend of the U. S., and its
                    leaders had a socialist bias talking about sort of the revolutionary origins.
                    They had close ties to the Soviets and other Bloc nations. It was generally
                    moderate in its votes in the United Nations, which has always been a big factor
                    in our presence in these posts. In any event, the USAID mission director was an
                    FE-MC; I arrived as an FS-O2. In fact, there were 17 people at post who
                    outranked me, and yet I was the DCM. Within six weeks of arrival I was the
                    Charg�, and served in that capacity for almost three months before Ann Holloway
                    finally finished her processing and came out. In that interval there was the
                    Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As Charg�, I was instructed to go to the
                    government, as were all chiefs of mission throughout Africa and all over the
                    world to persuade the host governments to speak out against the Soviet invasion
                    which was an egregious act of aggression. We thought the Third World's
                    expression of condemnation would be very valuable. I went to see the foreign
                    minister about it, and the foreign minister said, “You have to understand we're
                    very distant from the scene of this issue, and we don't understand the
                    complexities of it. It is not our traditional pattern to condemn these things.”
                    The fact of the matter was the Soviets were in Mali in substantial numbers.
                    There were probably some 200 to 300 Soviets in the country. They had a large
                    embassy; they had a technical assistance program; doctors and teachers in the
                    school system. Mali was receiving a significant amount of support. We found out
                    later that it was even more to it than that. The Foreign Minister temporized
                    about any kind of statement; “We will consider your request. I'll talk to the
                    president about it.” A very frustrating exercise. About the third or fourth time
                    that I had been to talk with him, I said, “You realize that if you cannot be
                    more responsive to our request which is of great importance to the U.S., this
                    may have an impact on our bilateral assistance program.” He took that onboard
                    and didn't comment much about it. I reported this to the country team at which
                    only the Deputy USAID Director attended. The USAID director went ballistic. “You
                    had no authority to threaten him with a cutback in the AID program. This is not
                    your program, its AID's.” I asked, “Why do you think we have an AID program
                    here? We are not here solely to provide development to this country? USAID is
                    part of our effort to support U.S. policy objectives in this country, and in
                    this particularly instance the objective we're talking about here is getting him
                    to speak out on this egregious act.” He was livid about it, and I'm sure, as he
                    threatened, he appealed to Washington about it. His protests went nowhere
                    because he was wrong, and I was right. To go back to the AID program, we were
                    involved in a number of projects. The Niger River flows through Mali and the
                    agricultural potential there is reasonable for irrigation and production along
                    the floodplain of the river. We were involved in several multinational projects
                    of that sort, but the key constraint was that the Malians administrators were
                    really not capable of carrying out what we had all agreed were the common
                    objectives. The numbers of projects just multiplied and multiplied and I don't
                    mean any disrespect of Pat Byrne, she's a great person, but frankly I don't
                    think she monitored carefully enough what the USAID director was up to. At one
                    stage I was traveling with her. We were in Mopti in the AID guesthouse there.
                    She asked the deputy USAID mission director how many projects we had in Mali. He
                    replied it was up to about 36 projects. She said “The last time I checked it was
                    only 23 or so.” This was indicative to my mind that she hadn't been keeping as
                    close watch as she might on the burgeoning USAID empire. Of course, USAID also
                    had the most senior of the Foreign Service Nationals at the top of the FSN pay
                    scale, perhaps 12. At the embassy there were maybe two. After the USAID director
                    moved on, in part we believed because Ann Holloway and I were increasingly
                    demanding of project information, in part because he had been there for six
                    years when I arrived and he'd already had a really good run. He had excellent
                    accommodations. He had a massive staff. He had all the perks you could possibly
                    want. He had had pretty much a free hand and then, all of a sudden, we began to
                    ask a lot of detailed questions and he found this more and more uncomfortable
                    and more and more annoying.</p>

                        background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, she had graduated from Bennington College. She had a Ph.D. from
                    an institution in Philadelphia. She was a bright, capable sort of person. She
                    had recently been divorced and she had her two daughters with her. She was very
                    much into the African experience and culture. Her attitude reflected the
                    attitude that Dick Moose had enunciated; activist and sympathetic, but not
                    aggressive. She was inclined to accept Africans for what they are. During her
                    tour in Mali, there was increasing political agitation against the government.
                    Students were unhappy with the limited opportunities once they graduated. Like
                    many African countries there were more graduates than jobs. They were frustrated
                    and they took to the streets. By June they were creating rather major havoc and
                    the military was turned out against them. The military handled them pretty
                    roughly. Her relations with the government were tempered by our continuing
                    effort to get out of the government an expression of condemnation vis-�-vis the
                    Soviets in Afghanistan. Then there was the issue of boycott of the 1980 Moscow
                    Olympics as a protest about Afghanistan. Again, we were under instructions to
                    persuade the Malians not to participate. In fact, they didn't have a very large
                    Olympic team. There were about six people of Olympic quality. The ambassador
                    shortly after arrival was instructed to go talk to the president about the
                    boycott. So, there was great fanfare and expectation because it was the first
                    formal visit after she presented her credentials. The President's expectation
                    was that we had yet another grand new program to propose to him. Instead she had
                    to present him with the fact that we wanted him to boycott the Olympics and as
                    we had asked other nations to do. I accompanied her to make her presentation.
                    She was nervous and had a little trouble getting her point across. Her mastery
                    of French was never that good. She made a labored effort. The President seemed
                    agitated, and drew himself up, hesitated and said, “Je prends acte;” I take note
                    of what you have to say. Nothing beyond that. He didn't say that we would
                    consider it or discuss the merits. With that, the meeting came to an end and we
                    were ushered out. The media's cameras were all out there expecting the
                    announcements of new accord or assistance, but we said nothing. We left it to
                    him to say how he wanted to handle this with his own press. But, that was not a
                    particularly fortuitous start with the president, as you can imagine.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Moussa Traore, a former military officer who had come to power in a
                    coup. Regrettably, his wife, who was part Lebanese, was known to be deeply
                    involved in a range of corrupt activities. Among others was the government
                    monopoly on the import of pharmaceuticals, which she ran. This was a
                    money-making machine and she was the beneficiary, and he benefited ultimately as
                    well. In part the students were angry that the economy was not going well, and
                    they were unhappy about government corruption. So, they took to the streets. One
                    day in June, Ann Holloway was out driving around the city and she saw a dump
                    truck load of detained students being hauled off. They had been thrown into the
                    truck, and the military got in and were pounding these kids with rifle butts.
                    She witnessed that, and, all of a sudden, her attitude towards this government
                    began to change. She realized that we really shouldn't be quite so sympathetic
                    to the Malian government, as they were little better than thugs. Then she sent a
                    telegram about the situation and it reflected her change of attitude. She
                    proposed that we try to find ways to get Traore to reform. We ought to be
                    helping to educate people who would possibly be alternates to Traore. But Traore
                    was no fool. He was going to stay on top and anybody who was a real contender
                    for power was sent out to the “brouse,” or sent to the salt mines. He wasn't an
                    extraordinarily repressive leader. His ultimate downfall years later resulted
                    from his security forces refusing to fire on a mob of students, which led to his
                    collapse. This occurred after he had directed them to set fire to a school full
                    of students which killed a great number of children. After that his people went
                    crazy, and the government fell.</p>
                <p>During our time, the government was not easy to communicate with. You could talk
                    with people who were supposedly responsible. Blondin Beye was the Foreign
                    Minister; an opaque and cautious fellow. After Traore's government fell, he
                    became a UN official of some note. He was involved in mediating in Angola I
                    believe, and was killed in an air crash. You could talk to officials around the
                    President, but Traore himself was really not very approachable. By comparison to
                    my days as ambassador in Gabon where I could see Bongo virtually anytime if I
                    had something important to say. Traore was the typical of Francophone African
                    leaders, and none of the other ambassadors, with the obvious exception of the
                    French, really had much access to him.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, it was significant, but not dominant. The French were principally
                    concerned about maintaining a good relationship with their former colonies
                    primarily to keep their finger on their pulse to make sure that they didn't go
                    radical which could adversely impact French interest in the coastal African
                    nations and in North Africa. Granted, they had more than enough problems with
                    the Algerians and radical north Africans as it was, they didn't need turmoil in
                    the Sahel threatening their more productive relationships with the Ivory Coast
                    and Togo, for example. There were significant numbers of French counseilliers
                    technique and teachers, and they made a significant contribution to the nation's
                    stability and management. The Soviets, with their large presence, permitted the
                    Soviet ambassador a fair amount of access to the chief of state or so it seemed.
                    We knew the Soviet ambassador. He was a fairly reasonable human being. He was
                    from Tajikistan; a Tajik. He had his issues with his own government sometimes.
                    The Soviets were locked into a role in Africa not unlike ours, as they wanted to
                    influence local events for international purposes, but had limited resources.
                    So, they were able to pressure the Malians to avoid condemning their involvement
                    in Afghanistan. The Malians did, in fact, send a delegation to the Moscow games.
                    It turned out that their athletes were all being trained by the Soviets and the
                    Soviets paid their way and provided accommodations in Moscow. They just couldn't
                    turn it down. So, we lost that battle. It was probably a losing proposition from
                    the beginning unless we were willing to pay for them to stay home. The Soviets
                    had this massive Embassy compound with barracks-like staff accommodations; like
                    low cost housing projects in the United States. Of course, they couldn't have
                    any local staff because of security concerns, and they were all watching each
                    other. They couldn't have any contact with Westerners unless it had been
                    approved, except at the ambassadorial level. I had the good fortune of going to
                    the Soviet ambassador's residence for the farewell luncheon for Ambassador Byrne
                    and they really did put on the dog. They had their own dependents doing the
                    serving, and they laid out this fantastic table. There was a phalanx of glasses
                    at each setting. I'll never forget this; there was a tiny vodka glass on the
                    right to the water glass to the white wine glass, the red wine glass, the
                    champagne glass on the left. It was all this beautiful crystal. Contrary to
                    protocol, our Ambassador was at the far end of the table she by the Soviet
                    ambassador's wife. Ed Brynn and I were on either side of the ambassador. We got
                    in a conversation with him about cars. He was quite pleasant and his French was
                    quite serviceable. Every time they served a wine, the hosts would say, this is a
                    Russian product. The champagne was from Georgia; “People tell us that it is
                    better than the champagne made in France.” The wines were all from Russia. Of
                    course, the vodka, and they kept your vodka glass constantly full. At the end of
                    the meal, they served something called Armeniac from Soviet Armenia. They said,
                    “It's just the same as cognac. Some people say its better.” It was terrible;
                    execrable. We mentioned to the ambassador, with all this talk about all these
                    superior Soviet products, we noticed that he drove a Mercedes. “Why don't you
                    drive a Russian car?” He said, “Oh, no, we have excellent cars, but we want to
                    be consistent with all the other ambassadors' cars; and they all have black
                    Mercedes.” By comparison our DCM vehicle was a God-awful mustard yellow AMC
                    vehicle. It was on its last legs as it had flipped over several months before.
                    So, we were no one to talk about our vehicles, I suppose. The Soviets were
                    constantly in a panic that they would be compromised by the Westerners. Of
                    course, we were always interested in getting Bloc diplomats to defect, which was
                    the CIA's principal job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because basically that's what they did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's right. If they didn't have that mission, we wouldn't have had
                    agency people there. That wasn't just the Soviets, we were after the Chinese,
                    Cubans and Eastern Europeans. Either they were aware of it, or they suspected
                    it, as they were so constrained in their movements. When you could talk to these
                    Soviets, they would tell you, “We like it here in Mali.” Their conditions were
                    pretty bad, all things considered, in Western terms. Nonetheless, it was better
                    than life in the Soviet Union at that time. They wanted to stay on. They didn't
                    want to get themselves in a compromising situation where they'd be sent back to
                    the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you really end up with an aid mission that's there for
                        its own benefit. I'm exaggerating. The Soviets are there because it's a good
                        deal, I mean this is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Our bilateral relationship was in a holding pattern. Those nations
                    represented in Bamako were there to see that things did not go against their
                    interests; that's to say the French, the Soviets, and the Americans. While our
                    assistance program had an idealistic dimension and we hoped to achieve
                    reasonable development objectives, the size and scope was really driven by an
                    empire-building mission director. It was well in excess of what we needed to
                    maintain that basic watching relationship. After I left Bamako, “60 Minutes”
                    with Leslie Stahl, did an expose on the waste in AID programs in Mali. CBS
                    showed a whole parking lot of USAID-furnished vehicles that were broken down and
                    rotting away. Of course, the lack of spare parts and maintenance was to blame,
                    as well as management hubris. But there they were with the USA handshake symbol
                    on them. So the USAID got its head scrubbed in successive years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Ambassador Holloway came there, did you sit down and
                        tell her your impression of AID thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Oh yes. I said we have a real problem on our hands. Shortly after my
                    arrival, while Pat Byrne was still there, I did my initial orientation to all
                    U.S. activities. I went over to see the USAID mission director, Ron Levin, a
                    name you may or may not have heard of; a world-class bureaucratic gamesman. He
                    high-hatted me from the moment I walked onto his compound to the time that he
                    dropped me off at the Embassy in his chauffeur-driven Peugeot 604 sedan, where
                    he made a point of sitting in the right rear seat, the position of rank. After
                    showing me all the things that needed to be repaired and upgraded in his kingdom
                    as if I were his GSO, he allowed as how if I ever had any questions about the
                    USAID mission, that I could just call his deputy and the deputy would give me a
                    response. I was amazed and amused, so I talked to Pat Byrne and recounted the
                    entire episode. I said “Can you believe this guy's gall?” To her eternal credit,
                    she immediately said to her secretary, “Get Ron Levin on the phone; I want to
                    talk to him.” She said, “Now, Ron, you listen to me. I'm telling you how things
                    are going to be. When my Deputy wants to find out something about what's going
                    on in the USAID mission, he will call you, and you will provide him the
                    information, is that understood?” “Yes, Madam Ambassador.” So, while she was
                    still there he had to bite his tongue. In the period that I was the charg�, he
                    refused to visit the Embassy or to attend the Country team meetings. He made a
                    point of either being out of the country on some pretext, or he would just send
                    his deputy. I assume that was because he outranked be, and he was certain he was
                    superior to me in al things. The principal tactic USAID used to maintain its
                    independence was to deny us the information we needed to know what their program
                    was expected to achieve. The way USAID played the game there was to ensure that
                    any policy documents like the country program plan, a 160-page largely
                    unreadable document, which they were supposed to submit for COM review and
                    approval would not be provided to the Embassy until the evening before it was to
                    be submitted to Washington. While it was supposed to be signed off by the
                    Ambassador, they would deliver it to the ambassador's office at 3:00 pm in the
                    afternoon and say somebody was hand-carrying it at 6:00 pm to AID Washington.
                    She had less than three hours to review it. I said to the ambassador if you let
                    him get away with this, things will never change. You will never have a chance
                    to have any input, to say nothing about asking him any questions about the
                    program or the process. It was a constant struggle. Nonetheless, we figured out
                    his game and did start asking questions. Major policy documents would not go out
                    until the ambassador has had three days to review it. I just told him that's
                    what the Ambassador wants. Such constraints on his long reign of unbridled
                    empire building proved a sufficient nuisance that he asked to be transferred
                    after seven years. He was transferred about a year after we arrived, apparently
                    because the fun had gone out of the process for him. AID does some good work,
                    but this situation was an example of the worst face of AID.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and a system, you know, it was one that allowed for

                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Levin was essentially a very capable guy. He was a bright, a graduate
                    of Harvard Law, I think. He spoke 5/5 French. He was married to a Swiss-French
                    woman and his French fluency was so superior to anybody else's in the mission,
                    and he flaunted it to the fullest. He had a wide circle of contacts in the
                    Malian government over the many years he was there. Many Malians viewed him as
                    the representative of the U.S. and I am certain he did not try to disabuse them.
                    The bottom line was that he viewed the program as his own, and not the United
                    States government's. He would say as much. I tried to make the point that there
                    were U.S. taxpayer dollars, and to remind him why we provide aid to these
                    nations. There were those in AID Washington and many of his own subordinates
                    were unhappy with the way he ran things. He had an iron fist over his own
                    operation, and advancement went to those who were loyal to him and not to the
                    most capable. Ultimately he overplayed his hand in Central America, and he got
                    shoved out of AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during this time you were there from '79 to '81,
                        we've talked about the AID thing, were there any other particular
                        developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, other than trying to get the Malians to support us on
                    international issues against the Soviets, in which we had little success or no
                    success on. The relationship remained cool as a result. The idea of further
                    expanding our aid program or having any dramatic improvement in the bilateral
                    relationship was unlikely. After the repression of the students, Ambassador
                    Holloway was less inclined to promote closer ties. We maintained good relations
                    with officials on an individual level, but we never made a breakthrough with the
                    president. In fact, life in Bamako, was rather hard. You have to remember that
                    this was the period following the great Sahelian drought of the early 1970s. The
                    Malians had received a vast amount of assistance to deal with the drought. We
                    wanted to try to provide some degree of food security so that the drought would
                    never have quite the devastating impact that it did during that time. There was
                    an area In Bamako south of the Niger River which was known as the quatier de la
                    sechresse, the neighborhood of the drought. All the villas were built by
                    officials who were beneficiaries of foreign assistance funds meant to relieve
                    the drought. Instead of going to the people who had been impacted, they had been
                    able to divert it to their own ends, and they built nice villas. Then they
                    wanted to rent them to Westerners, and the U.S. Mission did rent a few of them.
                    You'd see these tremendous cement villas and there were no roads between them.
                    There was just a space remaining between them and that became the road. The
                    other issue was the continuing crisis in the supply of electricity and water.
                    The Canadians and the World Bank were completing a dam on a tributary of the
                    Niger. There was to be a power line from the hydro plant to the capital. There
                    was also an issue about completing the road to the dam. The Canadians were in
                    charge of the power transmission line. They were remarkably efficient in this
                    effort. The capital was dependent on the local generating plant for its power,
                    but the city had grown more than double its designed maximum population. The
                    infrastructure left by the French, and this is repeated all over former colonial
                    Africa, was breaking down. 20 years is about the useful life of any capital
                    equipment. Most African nations became independent in 1960, and the operative
                    infrastructure, power and water plants, were not maintained as they had been by
                    the colonial powers. As a result, Bamako would go for extended periods of time
                    without electricity, in particular. When the electricity was down, the water
                    pumping station didn't operate.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>The ambassador and I lived in the Quartier de Fleuve along the river, as did a
                    number of the senior government officials. So, our power and water service was
                    generally better than others areas, but the rest of the mission was scattered
                    throughout the city. We did have an effective generator program that could keep
                    at least lights and one or two air conditioners going on in every house at
                    night. There would oftentimes be no water. There was little we could do about
                    that except set up a system to fill their rooftop water tanks. This situation
                    wears down peoples' dedication and commitment to the mission. As the Deputy
                    Chief of Mission, one of my principal responsibilities was to try to keep our
                    people happy, and to deal with their complaints and concerns. We had an officer
                    who was a pretty tough, experienced character who said, if we don't get power
                    and water in the next two weeks, my wife and kids are going home, and he would
                    leave as well. I said, “Look I'd love to be able to promise you it's going to
                    get better, but I can't, and you know I can't.” I was sympathetic as we had a
                    baby in our house as my son Ian had been born in the U.S. in June 1980 and while
                    I had been fortunate enough to return home to be with my wife for his birth, we
                    both had some trepidation about bringing him back into that situation. Our
                    community was constantly under these pressures. I remember a colleague of mine
                    saying, he'd come home and ask his wife if there was any power today. Without
                    power there would be no water. If she said there hadn't been any, he'd just drop
                    his briefcase, take off his suit and shoes and jump directly into the swimming
                    pool. He figured what the hell, what difference does it make when you get down
                    to it? It was very demoralizing after a while. Reliable power was not available
                    until after I left.</p>
                <p>Ann Holloway arrived at in December of '79 and when the new administration came
                    in January of '81. One of the very first things the Reagan team did in the
                    transition was to identify the Carter-appointed ambassadors. They were going to
                    be notified very quickly that they were out. Within three days of Secretary Haig
                    being sworn in Secretary of State, the ambassador received a cable from him
                    which she showed it to me. She said, “What do you think about this? What should
                    I do?” The cable said, we appreciate your service to the United States
                    government, and so on, and we would like you to wrap up your affairs in 15 days
                    and turn over your mission to your Charg�. I thought that was unbelievable. I
                    had never heard of it being done in that short a period of time. I suggested
                    that she send a reply saying that it would be detrimental to our bilateral
                    relationship if she were forced to leave Bamako in only two weeks. Further ,
                    there are ongoing activities that require her oversight and participation, and
                    she would need a minimum of 60 days to get things in order. So, we drafted a
                    telegram along these lines. They responded giving her a month to leave. So, 30
                    days later she was gone and I was the Charg� then from late February until I
                    left in July.</p>

                <p>One of the early requirements in the Reagan era was to sell the Africans on the
                    idea that U.S. Africa policy under the Reagan administration was going to be
                    equally as concerned as its predecessor although all the statements being made
                    in Washington belied that. In particular, we were asked, as part of the USIA
                    program, to invite key Malian leaders to my residence to show them a tape of the
                    confirmation hearing of Secretary Haig. When, the Senators asked about Africa,
                    his response essentially said the U.S. sees the region as a battleground of the
                    Cold War. Well, our script told us to persuade Africans that we were interested
                    in the Africans for themselves and not as a factor in the East-West struggle. We
                    were still going to try to provide development, but that there would probably be
                    a greater emphasis on their willingness to support American views, particularly
                    democracy and free enterprise, read capitalism. We made that presentation and
                    they listened respectfully. They responded, your Secretary said that Africa is a
                    battleground and we don't want to be a battleground between East and West. We
                    have our agenda, our own concerns about development and you are essentially
                    reducing us to a role we don't want. We would like you to tell Washington that
                    we don't appreciate that. We told Washington that and it didn't get us anywhere.
                    We continued to peddle this line, but assistance levels were on the decline. Our
                    programs were beginning to wind down, either running out of funds or failing to
                    meet the objectives that they were intended to achieve.</p>
                <p>The relationship cooled further. We tried to sell this idea that we were equally
                    as engaged as we had been in the previous administration. It simply didn't fly.
                    To some extent the Soviets and the French gained on us in this time, not that
                    there was much to be gained.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: We went back to Washington and I was working in Personnel. I was chief

                    job.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: From '81 to '83, I was in PER/CDA/AF responsible for staffing the
                    African bureau, the INR bureau and the Administrative bureau. We were called
                    assignment officers, and there were the CDOs, career development officers were
                    responsible to find job for their clients. It was our primary job was to find
                    the right people to serve in Africa and the AF bureau. INR was sometimes
                    difficult to staff. A was more a matter of finding the right specialist at the
                    right time. But, AF was not considered a highly a desirable area to serve, which
                    was a mistake because, in point of fact, it was a very interesting area. Under
                    the Open Assignments process, we had to work with those who had bid on our
                    positions. Often AF and INR jobs would go underbid or unbid, and we'd have to
                    come up with creative ways of attracting people. Of the five regional assignment
                    offices, we always had to try harder. We had to run hard in place just to keep
                    up, and we did. We manipulated and we used every mechanism we could to try to
                    increase our chances of getting the right people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about manipulating your chances. Tell me down
                        deep and dirty.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Okay. Well, one of the things we tried to do was to persuade people
                    that service in Africa would be beneficial because they would have a level of
                    responsibility superior to that they would have in any other regions because the
                    jobs would be rated at the FS-03 level, but you were really doing the work of a
                    FS-02 or above. They would have large FSN staffs and extensive responsibilities,
                    particularly in the administrative area. As a reporting officer, they would
                    oftentimes be the sole reporting officer other than Embassy management itself.
                    This would get them some profile in Washington and give them a leg up on your
                    competitors in other regions. Further, we would write to the Ambassadors and
                    DCMs to say it was very important that they see to it that their evaluations of
                    their personnel be of the highest quality. We weren't asking them to write
                    outstanding evaluations for people who don't cut it, but they should give full
                    credit for their subordinates' efforts. They were reminded that AF was in
                    competition with the other regional bureaus when it comes to promotion and their
                    records should look strong and credible and give full play to the difficult
                    circumstances under which they operated. We also persuaded the leadership of the
                    African bureau to assist us in arranging good onward assignments for people
                    who've done time and performed well in Africa, and that they prevail on their
                    colleagues and friends in other bureaus to see to it that our people who wanted
                    to take a tour outside of Africa have a chance at good jobs in other bureaus. We
                    would also follow up and help them through that process. These were the more
                    overt ways in which we'd try to do make AF competitive. The more sub rosa, if
                    you will, ways were that we constantly tapping the grapevine for potential
                    candidates for AF. As we knew about the openings and we started penciling in
                    candidates before the cycle began. Then we filled the initial wave of jobs for
                    which we had an adequate numbers of bidders. One of the things that AF could
                    offer that other bureaus couldn't was that AF had some 42 missions, we could
                    offer DCMships at a relatively early stage in a career, at the FS-02 and 01
                    level. These offered great opportunities for management experience, which was
                    considered virtually essential at that time for officers seeking promotion. The
                    senior threshold concept was coming into existence and PER was proposing six
                    different requirements that individuals would have had to fulfill for the Senior
                    Foreign Service. They included resource management and supervision, personnel
                    supervision, and DCMships would offer those skills. What we would do was not
                    only play that card to attract good, competitive, qualified DCMs, but also, to
                    persuade more junior officers that this was an option that was going to open for
                    them if they did good time in Africa, and if they did well in it in those jobs.
                    That was one of the ways we'd try to entice people to serve in AF. Of course,
                    there's the constant process of networking within the bureau and outside the
                    bureau with your colleagues in other assignment offices, and there was a fair
                    amount of horse-trading. To give you a specific example, I was driving into work
                    one morning and I had heard that the government in Sri Lanka had PNG'd an
                    American political officer there. We were in need of a desk officer in
                    particular in AF/W, and I wondered who this individual was. No name was given on
                    the news broadcast. I worked very closely with Len Shurtleff who, as you know,
                    is an old Africa hand serving as the deputy executive director in AF. He was
                    able to find out from NEA who this officer was. We immediately got a hold of him
                    and made a pitch to him for and AF job, and wrapped him up even before he'd left
                    Sri Lanka.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Ken Scott, a real good officer. He served us well on a number of other
                    positions in AF. He had a general interest in Africa, but we were the first to
                    make the offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An ambulance chaser comes to mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Pretty much. There was an element of that. As I said, we really had to
                    hustle to get people to serve in our positions because what we could offer was
                    primarily those supervisory opportunities, but not the fleshpots that EUR or EAP
                    could offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things, my particular career profession was
                        consular. In Africa it seemed like there wasn't much in the way of moving up
                        because once you reached a certain mid-career level, there really were all
                        these countries requiring relatively low-ranking consular officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: This is true. There were a very few senior consular positions. There
                    were a number of other constraints other than the perception of the backwardness
                    of the African countries. While Americans were deprived of cultural
                    opportunities, of greater concern were issues of climate, health and education
                    for the children. Children's education was a severe problem for AF because we
                    were looking for more senior and more experienced administrative officers, in
                    particular. The administrative function in Africa is much more important than it
                    is in other regions of the world, given the lack of infrastructure and goods and
                    services. We had to build our own infrastructure and establish a level of
                    maintenance to be able to function. These support operations were really quite
                    impressive. They included generating electricity for our residences and
                    providing water as well as maintaining their homes, travel and other services
                    because none of that existed in the market beyond. So, we wanted more
                    experienced and talented admin people. The problem was the more experienced they
                    were, the more likely they were to have kids of high school age and at that time
                    there were only five accredited high schools in all the African posts. This
                    meant the separation from their teenage kids, which was for many parents very
                    difficult. They were given an allowance to send their kids to private school in
                    the United States or Europe, and the allowance was quite generous. Even in those
                    days in the $22,000 to $25,000 a year range, but it did mean that they would be
                    cut off from their children at a critical stage in their development. They'd see
                    them in the summer and at Christmas, but that was it. If the kids had emotional
                    or educational development problems, there would be a disinclination to accept
                    an AF assignment requiring separation.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Subsequently, of course, several of those five high schools were closed. Maybe
                    those in Nairobi and Pretoria are still functioning. The ones in Kinshasa and
                    Liberia have closed down. The one in Nigeria may not still be accredited. We
                    were constantly trying to figure out what we could do to meet the need for
                    administrative officers. You could get bright, young officers in any of these
                    functions and they could do a good job, but experience was important. It was
                    also important in the administrative function for such things like how to build
                    an operating budget and how to get the best out of your resources. At least the
                    African bureau had a reputation of being very strong in administrative
                    management and very supportive of its people in the field. They had very active
                    and experienced people working in AF/EX. They also had some really good
                    executive directors for the bureau. They understood right away what the bureau
                    needed, that they had to work hard just to get the resources and use them
                    wisely. They had an excellent permanent GS staff who did a really bang up job.
                    Everybody said they've got the best support they've ever had from the AF bureau.
                    That was an incentive to serve in the region. But it was a constant
                    struggle.</p>
                <p>The most enjoyable part of working in CDA was that you learned a vast amount
                    about how Personnel really works when it comes to assignments, and assignments
                    are the key to promotion and advancement. No one should delude himself about it.
                    Getting a good competitive job is a key ingredient in your moving forward in the
                    Service. Not all officers are motivated by career advancement. There were family
                    considerations, health considerations and financial considerations. When it came
                    to advancement AF could attract these young, dynamic officers to take our
                    positions. We did quite well at that time. It did require the intervention and
                    sometimes the active efforts of recruitment by members of the AF bureau in
                    Washington, who made phone calls and explained about the jobs. We took the
                    fullest advantage of international communications, such as they were at that
                    time, to try to persuade people to serve in the AF. You also had to know a good
                    deal about personnel regulations. One of the refinements about the Open
                    Assignment process was that a job that had three or fewer bidders was designated
                    as a “hard-to-fill.” The bureau that had such jobs, and AF had plenty, had
                    priority of snagging whoever had already bid on that job. So, you could wrap
                    them up before they knew what happened. Everybody had been told that any job you
                    bid on, you could be assigned to, no matter what the priority that you put on
                    that position.</p>
                <p>We didn't want somebody who wasn't going to be happy in an AF job, but, at the
                    same time, we had to push pretty hard to get people to accept assignments.
                    Oftentimes they would come to accept these assignments reluctantly, and then
                    they'd look back it and they'd say “That was a fantastic job for me, and my
                    family prospered, we had excellent housing, our health concerns proved
                    unfounded.”</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>In the CDA assignment system, the real fun was the inter-functional panel. It met
                    every Friday morning, and you geared up for it most of the week. These were
                    usually the best jobs in the assignment cycle. They were the DCM jobs, and the
                    jobs that went beyond cone, and they included all the senior positions. There
                    was a lot of competition for these jobs, and every CDA office had to submit an
                    agenda of whom they proposed to assign to what job. The agendas had to be
                    submitted on Thursday and they would be compiled into a master agenda, and then
                    distributed. There were 12 members of the IF panel chaired by the director of
                    CDA who was the tiebreaker only. Each agenda item was then read to the panel as
                    they went around the table. If there were no problems with it the assignment, it
                    would be formally paneled. If someone asked to put a hold on it, each office had
                    two weeks to renegotiate because they had a candidate for the job or they wanted
                    that candidate for a job of their own regional bureau. There was a lot of
                    enjoyable interplay and bantering back and forth in these sessions. It was my
                    sense that this was as fair and open a process as you could devise. The issues
                    were how the agenda was developed, and the horse-trading to get it done. There
                    would be tradeoffs and you'd say I won't put a hold on your candidate if you'll
                    support mine. There was also a fair amount of openness in terms of deciding or
                    debating an assignment. If a question were raised while you were going through
                    your agenda and they'd ask why are you assigning so and so there? You had to be
                    prepared to say, well, he's an officer at the grade, he's had experience in this
                    area and his has linguistic skills, a 3+/3 in Spanish say. You had to explain
                    the rationale for the assignment and it had to make sense to your colleagues who
                    were pretty savvy people. Sometimes we felt that EUR had the inside track on all
                    assignments as they made a lot of assignments before the jobs came to panel.
                    Sometimes they did it before the open assignments cables went out, as they had
                    already lined up people for jobs. We'd see these stretch assignments or where
                    people didn't have the required linguistic skills. Then we'd put a hold on the
                    assignment or we'd vote it down, we'd flat out vote it down. There was
                    considerable enjoyment in shooting down EUR assignments. Next thing we'd know,
                    the assignment was directed by the Director General. There was occasional
                    resentment from senior management in those highly desirable bureaus who felt,
                    “Who are these people in the personnel system who are telling us we can't have
                    so and so?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I imagine there is a certain amount of you know,
                        trying to knock them down in the line. Fair enough in the system where there
                        is supposed to be about fairness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. What used to happen was, for example, we'd get a directed
                    assignments which meant that the Director General would order, so and so to be
                    assigned to certain post. CDA was reduced to being a rubber stamp. There was a
                    great resentment in CDA about these kinds of assignments. For example, an
                    ambassador chose a DCM, who was a four-grade stretch in a European post. It was
                    a very, very controversial case at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: This was Switzerland as a matter of fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's always Switzerland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It's always a very nice place. The assignment absolutely stunk and
                    virtually everybody knew the real story. There was a fair amount of resentment,
                    but the deal was done. If that's what the Director General directs, case closed.
                    We could give the 6th floor a sense of the panel through the director of CDA
                    requesting that he raise it with the Director General that the IF panel
                    disagreed with the assignment. So, from time to time we'd be able to voice our
                    unhappiness about some of these concerns. The IF panel included Senior officers
                    assignments, of course, and JO's, you had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: JO's meaning junior officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Junior officers, right, and you had senior officers, SO, and then you
                    had the CDO's for the four functional cones, and the five regional assignment
                    officers and finally the office continuity employment. It basically had to do
                    with diversity and EEO concerns. Very good people filled this position and they
                    did a very credible job of to maintaining reason and balance in the IF panel's
                    deliberations. They all had a vote and we had to be persuaded that assignments
                    were right and fair, and made sense as well. Overall, it was a very enjoyable
                    two years. I worked very closely with Jim Bishop who was the deputy assistant
                    secretary responsible for AF staffing. We went over virtually every assignment
                    in the Bureau for the entire two years that I was there. We would scrutinize
                    that candidates for DCM, POL and ECON officer, senior ADMIN officers and senior
                    Consular officers, to make sure they were the people who could do the job. We
                    had an excellent group of people in the AF bureau. The AF bureau, unlike other
                    bureaus, considered the assignment officer position in CDA as an important job,
                    and both my predecessor and successor went on to become Ambassadors in
                    Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>AF really put serious emphasis in getting the right person into that CDA/AF
                    position. Somebody that would hustle and who understood the region and the kind
                    of people it needed. I don't know that that continued to be the case in recent
                    years. AF desk officer jobs are sometimes hard to sell because there is a lot of
                    routine work, and yet there is always a lot going on. When I was in AF/W, we
                    called it the office the “Coup of the Month Club.” There was always some
                    government being overthrown. Desk officers could always anticipate diverse
                    challenges in these positions, and they always got a trip to the region. The
                    downside was that, if they were not persuaded that they wanted to serve in
                    Africa, these could lead to an African assignment, and some had some hesitation
                    about that. To fill these positions we made a conscientious effort to assign
                    more consular and administrative officers as desk officers. The other bureaus,
                    having significant numbers of bidders on all their jobs, could easily take just
                    ECON and POL officers. We tried to spread the net wider to attract officers in
                    other cones because, even if they just go back to those functions and don't go
                    into the multifunctional cone, they would still have very valuable insights into
                    the policy side and have an opportunity to broaden their perspective, and their
                    career their horizons, as well. We also made a point of also getting females
                    into positions of responsibility. For this effort, Len Shurtleff and I shared
                    the Department's EEO Award in 1983. We were recognized for our success in
                    assigning minorities and females into positions with supervisory responsibility.
                    AF had a substantially larger percentage of female DCMs than other bureaus. We
                    would also counsel candidates going beyond the advice of their own CDO. The CDO
                    job was to get their people assigned. They would try to persuade the assignment
                    officers to accept their candidate. If we were not absolutely persuaded, we
                    could take out the candidate's performance file (OPF) and review it. You soon
                    learned how to read OPFs for what they really said. If we still not enthusiastic
                    about the candidate, we might bargain to get another officer in the economic
                    cone to fill this job, then perhaps accommodate the CDO's candidate for another
                    position they were looking for. There was always certain amount of horse-trading
                    in the process. In some cases candidates would come straight to the assignment
                    officers and say, “I understand there is this job, what are my prospects?” This
                    face-to-face contact did make a difference. You say networking disadvantages
                    some, but that's how things work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, yes, we're talking about, if you see somebody and
                        you talk to them. For one thing, they used the initiative to get there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's true. It happened in particular in a case in which a DCMship was
                    coming up in coastal West Africa, and there was a slate of candidates. We always
                    had a fairly lengthy slate for DCM jobs as opposed to most of our other
                    positions. By regulation, we had to do was to prepare a list of candidates for
                    the ambassador and the slate reflect the Foreign Service by gender and race. The
                    slate had to have a minimum of three, and usually five or six candidates. In
                    this instance, we sent out the slate and the ambassador called me, and said,
                    “What do you think about these candidates?” I said, “Well, there are two people
                    who are really pretty good,” but one of them had come by to see me and he seemed
                    like a bright, capable individual and showed a fair amount of initiative. I
                    said, “If I were to choose I'd choose this fellow.” My choice got the job and
                    went on to a great career in the Foreign Service, becoming an ambassador in his
                    own right. What can I tell you? When I was in performance evaluation in the
                    early 1990s, I used to brief all the incoming A-100 classes. I would tell them
                    you have to look after yourself. We have a system and we have procedures, but
                    you have to look after your own interest. You have to go out and find out about
                    jobs and you've got to talk to people about jobs and show your interest in the
                    opportunities. That's reality, whether you like it or not. With the open
                    assignment concept which came into operation in the early '70s, available
                    positions were known to everyone and you could learn the content of the job, its
                    availability, the grade, the tour of duty and the language requirements You
                    could bid on a minimum of six, max 15, and you could then monitor as they were
                    filled. They refined this procedure, such as how many people had bid on the
                    jobs. So, you had a reasonable sense of what your chances were. But the Open
                    Assignment process doesn't eliminate the necessity for showing the initiative
                    and expressing the interest in a position by talking to the supervisor, finding
                    more details about the content and demands of the job. When people did that,
                    they tended to get the job. In the assignment process, there was supposedly a
                    creative tension between the assignment officers and the CDOs, which is to say
                    the AOs had the jobs and CDOs had the bodies. The game was to put the two
                    together for the benefit of the bureaus and the individuals. There was a sense
                    that the people that controlled the jobs had much more influence than the people
                    who controlled the bodies because the CDOs clients who were more competitive
                    usually found their own jobs. The CDOs focused their energies and attention on
                    the people who were the least competitive for positions. That's where they spent
                    the great bulk of their time. Whereas, on the assignment side we had the jobs,
                    and with the DCM positions in particular, we had something really tangible to
                    offer. We had the ability to pick and choose which gave us the balance of power.
                    PER tried to redress this some years later when they did away with assignment
                    officers, and returned to the way it had been before when the regional bureaus
                    controlled the jobs. They then made those jobs available to the CDOs in CDA, and
                    the assignments were made by them. Now, it has changed back.</p>

                        mean the people who are considered all right otherwise, technically they'd
                        be out, and some of these people you couldn't get rid of?</hi>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: The people we called assignment problems; were those with chronic
                    assignment problems. Often they would not take jobs that were appropriate for
                    them because they thought there were better things in prospect for them if they
                    waited longer. They waited and waited, and in many cases they simply were not
                    competitive and their CDOs would not lay it out in black and white how limited
                    their assignment prospects really were. What we used to do, as we controlled the
                    positions, was to acknowledge that we had an obligation to take some of these
                    people. You simply had to take a certain percentage of these people. What we
                    tried to do in AF is to place them in a position where they would be supervised
                    by somebody with more experience. They might be the number two or three
                    political officer in a large political, economic or consular section. This
                    approach would look after the interests of the post and the bureau, but also
                    look after the interest of the individual. They would get the kind of
                    supervision that they would need. There were chronic assignment problems that
                    would go from one cycle to the next. They would be placed on over-complement or
                    assigned to some temporary position. On occasion, the CDO would say to the
                    assignment officers, this individual could be persuaded to retire, given their
                    age and grade. They just needed to be nudged or even pushed in that direction.
                    They looked to the AF bureau, which had a number of very unattractive posts, to
                    come up with a job that was so odious that it would force people to seriously
                    consider retirement.</p>
                <p>We did that once with a job in Guinea-Bissau, which is a pretty horrible place.
                    We offered this job for this purpose, and CDA got several people to retire
                    rather than take it. If they reach a point where if they won't take assignments,
                    their CDO can put them up for a directed assignment, which is to say they are
                    compelled to take what the system offers. They can appeal it, but it has to be a
                    substantive appeal based on why it wouldn't make sense to be assigned to that
                    position. That happened very rarely in the two years that I was in CDA.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>We had one case in which an individual who was to be forced assigned as a
                    communications officer to Kampala. He said he absolutely couldn't go. He
                    explained all his incredibly dreadful circumstances. Both he and his wife had
                    medical problems, his parents were aged with serious medical problems, and one
                    was terminally ill. The management of the communications bureau and the Director
                    General's office wanted to go the mat to get this job filled. It was a job that
                    was very difficult job to fill. Kampala in these days after Idi Amin's fall was
                    chaotic and dangerous. Finally, they paneled the assignment forcing this guy to
                    go. By this time his wife was severely ill. His father had died and his children
                    had some sort of educational developmental problems. Then when he took his
                    medical exam he failed, and so he got out of the assignment anyway. So after six
                    months of effort the forced assignment failed. It was only pursued in
                    extraordinary cases. For example, there was a second tour junior officer who was
                    assigned to Buenos Aires during the Falkland Islands war. Embassy Buenos Aires
                    needed American consular officers to help the Americans leave Argentina. There
                    was hostility against Americans because of our friendship with the British.
                    After many efforts to appeal the assignment, this candidate was told by his CDO,
                    speaking for the CA and ARA bureaus, he must depart on this date and must arrive
                    directly. He failed to depart as instructed. Finally, he was told by CDA to
                    either depart on this date and arrive on a Monday, or he was out of the Foreign
                    Service. The guy did depart on Monday, he arrived in BA on Wednesday. He felt so
                    insecure that he booked himself out on the next flight and returned to the U.S.
                    The case came before the IF panel and when they heard the whole story, they
                    pulled the plug on this guy and he was forced out of the Service. Clearly, you
                    can't have that kind of thing when you need people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things I've talked to some of the people,
                        ambassadors, who dealt with particularly in Israel and Saudi Arabia during
                        the Gulf War. There were a number of cases of people who really I'm trying
                        to think of a nice way to put it, but chickened out. I asked what happened
                        afterwards, well, the system really didn't do much about it. A certain
                        amount of I won't say bravery, but intuitiveness, you kind of do it, you
                        might feel insecure and you don't have to put your family through that, but
                        it's like being a soldier. If you're essentially, I mean if there's a streak
                        of cowardice there, you should recognize this and say, fine, go be a
                        stockbroker or something like that. I'm not sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. At the time I served in personnel, there was a strong sense of
                    that since we were all subject to these kinds of assignments, where you couldn't
                    take your family, or where there was a physical risk, everybody should share the
                    risk of such assignments. This sense of dedication was why they were so
                    determined not to let this guy off the hook, the more so because he was a junior
                    officer and really hadn't paid his dues. In this case, he did follow through and
                    made it stick. Inevitably people have found ways to dodge difficult assignments,
                    but there was a general sense and we are all in this together. We all are
                    subject to the kinds of assignments that you would not be enthused about taking,
                    but you are obliged to accept if that's the way it works out. Management would
                    show some flexibility in staffing particularly difficult posts, offering
                    one-year, unaccompanied tour recognizing that it would work a great hardship on
                    one's family. Either the central system or more likely the regional bureau would
                    offer two R&amp;R's in a one year period, finding a mechanism to do that and
                    then fund it. If it was important enough to get the position staffed, they would
                    make arrangements to make it happen. The individual was encouraged to negotiate
                    with the Department on the terms by which he would accept such an assignment. I
                    don't know if that is still the case, but to my mind, a personnel system must
                    show some suppleness so it can bend to the circumstances as they are, while
                    capitalizing on the common sense of dedication and responsibility we all have.
                    As they say, if we're in the Foreign Service, you should expect serve a majority
                    of our time overseas. That's what it's all about, and officers know, that is the
                    way it has got to be ultimately. While I was in CDA, they changed was the
                    eight-year rule to the five-year rule for continuous service in the U.S. There
                    was an appeal process, and certain automatic waivers. Some related to the
                    position that one currently encumbered, such as special assistant or a deputy
                    assistant secretary, or positions requiring unique or special skills. One could
                    apply for an extension based on compassionate reasons such as family health
                    issues, or children's educational. The committee would review them and make a
                    determination. In some cases, it would make some sort of compromise as to what
                    was acceptable, or it decided if the person wouldn't take the overseas
                    assignment, they were forced to resign or retire. I am not suggesting that this
                    process was flawless, but it did give CDA some power to move out those who no
                    longer wanted to serve overseas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the sort of the corridor things I've heard from
                        various officers, I have never experienced myself, about somebody who was
                        just doing a rotten job. They really wrote them up; at least they said they
                        wrote them up, yet they still hung on. Often or at least sometimes the cases
                        that would come to mind would be somebody who was probably of a minority and
                        who had claimed discrimination and everybody they went they were a problem
                        and trouble for everybody. God, don't get so and so because it's just
                        trouble, you're going to spend all your time and they didn't produce. Now, I
                        don't know whether these are real people or I mean just the story that goes
                        around. But, did you run across that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, there were employees who were truly chronic problems. What we used
                    to say in personnel was, if you can remember somebody's name from a previous
                    assignment cycle, they were probably a problem case. They were being considered
                    late in the cycle and you'd hear this name over and over being proposed for this
                    job and they'd turned it down. The CDO would propose an assignment for them or
                    asking for somebody to think of an assignment appropriate for a certain
                    individual. The reality was that there may have been higher percentage of
                    minorities in that situation, but there were plenty of non-minorities who were
                    assignment problems, I can assure you. They were just difficult people. They
                    were people in some cases who deluded themselves about what their career
                    prospects really were, and there were others who just didn't get it. They
                    couldn't get along with people. They were burned out or just not energetic
                    enough. Their ability to draft was weak, etc.</p>
                <p>I remember we had a Hispanic officer who had been sent for a year's university
                    training in composition and drafting in English. After that he still didn't
                    draft well. In a Hispanic environment he did great contact work, but he also had
                    to write reports in clear English and he still couldn't do it. Then the question
                    was what do you do with an individual like that? So, the IF panel, which has the
                    obligation and the authority to do this, instructed the CDO to talk to this
                    individual and tell him that unless he can master this skill within a specified
                    period of time, he has no future in the Service. Drafting, he was an economic
                    officer, is critical to the process.</p>
                <p>We had positions in INR, which was not considered a mainstream bureau and was not
                    particularly highly regarded. Officers wanted to be in the operational side of
                    the Department, and this was the analytical side. It had something of a mixed
                    reputation, and some officers took refuge there. Other people saw opportunities
                    to do just a two-year learning assignment in INR working on the region of
                    interest, and then shooting back into their regional bureau. INR had jobs on the
                    economic side, but I must say candidly INR's economic office was probably one of
                    the weakest offices in the econ function. We ended up assigning people who had
                    not performed well in the field or in the EB bureau into the INR economic staff.
                    These jobs were underbid and the people who staffed them were not very
                    competitive officers.</p>
                <p>The failing lies primarily with the drafters of the EERs. The raters just simply
                    didn't bite the bullet and tell the rated officer the way it is. In addition, in
                    those days, we selected out only a very small number of people. As a result, it
                    was very unlikely that the non-performers would be removed from the system.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of the two-year assignment in CDA was that you could promise a
                    person virtually anything. “If you take this tour and do well, in two years
                    you'll come back and by God the Bureau will give you a really good job. Well,
                    you're going to be gone in two years because assignment officers and the CDOs
                    always moved on and did not extend. In AF we did try to institutionalize
                    personnel management it so that the bureau developed a collective memory about
                    the people who had performed well and the promises to a large degree could be
                    fulfilled.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Putting people from “the other agencies” in some of these
                        jobs, did that sort of screw things up or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It did. I can speak from both the personnel assignments side, but also
                    from the operational side in the field. From the assignment side, the problem
                    was that these jobs would appear on the microfiche staffing patterns and people
                    would assume that they were available. They would inquire about them, and you
                    would have to say, no, that job is not available even though the TED would show
                    08/82 when in reality it wasn't really available. It did screw things up, and it
                    risked the possibility of compromising their peoples' cover. If the agency
                    wanted to have them under the embassy cover, they had to appear on the staffing
                    pattern or the FSNs would think something was fishy about their status. We'd
                    have to send messages back to bidders by DIRGEN channel, Director General
                    channel and say that it was not an available position. Operationally, these
                    arrangements were seldom very satisfactory for the Embassy. When they used
                    consular positions for cover, by agreement, they were supposed to devote a
                    minimum of 30% of their time to those cover positions. To be a consular officer,
                    as you know, you're administering the law; you can't just play the regulations
                    by the seat of your pants. You have to know the regulations and when you don't
                    know the answer, you check the regulations. Often that didn't occur and it
                    proved embarrassing and not helpful to our interests. It is unfortunate that it
                    worked out that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in '83 you're off to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: One of the things they used to say about assignments in PER is, you
                    help your friends, you screw your enemies and you get yourself a good onward
                    assignment. So, I got a good onward assignment. I went to Princeton's Woodrow
                    Wilson School for a year in senior training. There were three academic positions
                    available. One was at Harvard, one at Stanford and one at Princeton, but it
                    hadn't been active for several years. There had been one economic and Middle
                    East specialist at Princeton the preceding year, but they hadn't had someone as
                    a mid-career fellow for several years. I made some inquiries and found out that
                    it hadn't been staffed, but it did exist. It turned out that Art Tienken, who
                    was head of CDA and DCM in Addis when I was in Asmara, was a Princeton graduate
                    and he thought that was very commendable to restore an active position there.
                    The other options were the National War College and other Defense training
                    slots. I really wanted a break, to get out from under the AF bureau, in which I
                    had served almost continuously since my first assignment in Chad back in '69.
                    Princeton gave me that opportunity. My wife was a consular officer, and was
                    working in CA. Our oldest son, who had been born in 1980, was about three years
                    at this point. So I moved to Princeton and lived in the junior faculty housing.
                    We maintained a house in Alexandria as well and I did a fair amount of traveling
                    back and forth. It wasn't so bad.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>The program at Princeton was an excellent. I truly enjoyed it. I took courses at
                    the graduate level at the Woodrow Wilson School. It offered four different
                    disciplines; international economics, public administration; international
                    development, and local government. It was an absolutely superb program with
                    world-class scholars. I took classes for credit and I took a full load, five
                    courses each semester, with plenty of papers. I took only one course that was
                    related to Africa, and the rest of them were on the Near East and economic and
                    global politics. It was very loosely monitored by the Department. A
                    representative PER's long-term training office visited twice a year to see how
                    you were doing. Basically you're on your own. They pay your tuition and give you
                    an allowance for housing, which was almost adequate, and they pay for any school
                    supplies that you need. It gives you a chance to expand your horizons, which I
                    tried to capitalize to the fullest. The program organizers arranged a session
                    once a week for Humphrey fellows and the mid-career fellows, and invited guest
                    speakers to talk on a range of subjects. There were three other mid-career
                    fellows; one from AID, one from Treasury and one from the Library of Congress.
                    Princeton can attract the most spectacular guest speakers. Talk about
                    networking. Of course, George Shultz is a Princeton grad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say on this, Harvard, Yales, they kind of come and
                        go, but I mean once a Princeton grad, always a Princeton grad and they look
                        after each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, they network the bejesus out of the system. Ever since my year
                    there, every year I receive a form to fill out giving the position I was
                    currently occupying, in hope that I can help out a Princeton grad student. Sure
                    enough, when I was Ambassador in Gabon, I had Princeton grad students come out
                    to do a summer internship both years, and they were superb. They were bright,
                    and a real asset to the mission. It's not just the usual harassing you for
                    contributions, Princeton wants tangible assistance for their students and
                    graduates. I graduated from Johns Hopkins and they had had nothing comparable to
                    Princeton.</p>
                <p>In my second semester at Princeton I decided to branch out a bit. I took four
                    more courses in international affairs, economics and domestic policy, and I also
                    did a course in the history of architecture. I always wanted to learn more about
                    architecture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I just audited that course. It was about the history and philosophy of
                    architecture and taught by a very bright fellow from the Princeton U., not the
                    Woodrow Wilson School. I really enjoyed the time I spent there. It opened my
                    mind; we African types do tend to become increasingly concentrated on that
                    region of the world to the exclusion of other parts of the world. For example,
                    the invasion of Grenada took place and Professor Gilpin asked us about the
                    legality of American action. Remarkably, none of us thought in terms of
                    legality, but focused rather on the policy implications of this action. All
                    Woodrow Wilson School students had to have at least four years of practical
                    experience after graduating from undergraduate school to qualify, and they had
                    some extraordinarily bright people.</p>
                <p>There were a number of military officers from all the services taking the full
                    two-year masters program. When asked about what our reaction to the invasion of
                    Grenada, they provided a lot of tactical and strategic considerations, but no
                    one put their finger on the legal aspects of the undertaking. The legal
                    justification was that the Eastern Caribbean Coalition supposedly had asked us
                    to intervene? Well, it was very evident that we had essentially created this
                    coalition and it generated the request for our intervention. The professor
                    wanted to point that out, “Well, you've given me all kinds of explanations from
                    a strategic military or tactical perspective, but what about the legal, what
                    about the precedent that this establishes?” He had a point. We should be putting
                    that issue front, as it is especially relevant to this Iraq initiative that is
                    on the table at the moment. This discussion opened our eyes to that aspect. I
                    was at Princeton in the days of the Reagan administration, and Princeton's
                    drawing power exposed us to a character responsible for one of the most
                    intriguing activities I had ever heard of. He was a professor from Western
                    Michigan University and his specialty was to take important political issues and
                    the President's available time and parse the two out to the maximum advantage of
                    the administration. He did what he called “programming the asset,” the asset
                    being Ronald Reagan. Based on feedback from polls that were continuously being
                    conducted, they would determine what was important to his political agenda and
                    how much of the president's time should be allocated to that issue, be it the
                    Boy Scouts or a winning sports team or whatever, or on issues of education or
                    health. They would collate polling information and feed it to the president's
                    handlers and schedulers, recommending that he devote more time to a certain
                    issue and less to another. He said they'd been doing this from the time that
                    Reagan took over in 1981, and they'd had great success. Reagan was remarkably
                    well received by the American people in part because of these people working in
                    the back room working to make the President look good. One of the professors,
                    Gilpin, who found this fellow to be just too smug, said, “Well, you seem to have
                    had this process very well planned all the way through. Did you plan for the
                    recession of 1982-83?” The guy just fell silent, and then said, “We didn't
                    actually plan for that.” So much for planning everything! The Reagan man was
                    apparently disengaged about how they performed their image magic. What this
                    demonstrated was that the stature of the President had little to do with his
                    achievements, but more a matter of how to manage his image to keep his ratings
                    up by programming him time. This individual had a good run with the Reagan
                    administration. He then went back to academia and unfortunately died at a
                    relatively young age.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>That was the sort of the eye-opening opportunity that Princeton could provide. I
                    think that all officers should have a similar sort training opportunity, be it
                    academic or military. As the military options becoming such a large part of our
                    foreign policy, if they haven't been in the service themselves, they ought to
                    have an opportunity to train with the military and to have a sense of the
                    military mentality and its capabilities.</p>

                    from a career perspective. I had recently been promoted to 01 and as such, this
                    is a good time to take training as that first year you're not eligible for
                    promotion anyway. The theory at least at the time, you did your long-term
                    training immediately after your promotion, usually just after being promoted to
                    FS-01. All along, Princeton was to serve as a bridge to a job that I knew was
                    opening up in AF/W. Being in the personnel system and having managed the
                    assignments to the African bureau, I knew a deputy directorship in AFW was
                    coming open. I had a clear shot at that job, and that's where I ended up in the
                    summer of 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you took over Western African Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I was the senior Deputy Director responsible for the Francophone
                    nations of West Africa. AF/W had an Anglophone and a Francophone section. Most
                    of the AF/W countries were Francophone, but the ones that generated the greatest
                    concern and assets were the Anglophones, which is to say Liberia, Ghana, Nigeria
                    and Sierra Leone and the Gambia. There were 17 nations total, and I had the
                    other 12 French speaking countries. I worked for Ed Perkins, the office director
                    for the first year. Len Shurtleff was in the background orchestrating this
                    personnel ballet. He was then DCM in Liberia working for Bill Swing. Ed Perkins,
                    his predecessor as DCM in Monrovia, was later nominated to replace Bill Swing.
                    So Len worked for Ed for Len's last year in Monrovia, and I worked my first year
                    in AF/W with Ed and my second year in AF/W for Howard Walker. We dealt with an
                    exciting set of issues. As I said, AF/W was known as the “Coup of the Month
                    Club” because, with 17 countries, there seemed to be a political upheaval every
                    month. The Western Sahara's fate was also one of our issues. From time to time
                    it became a hot item because the underlying conflict between Morocco and
                    Algeria, which impacted Mauritania, which was an AF/W nation and an ally of
                    Morocco. There were always things brewing on the Francophone side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Chad was in AF/C and we didn't deal with it directly. We had similar
                    problems such as Senegal which had fractious elections and subsequent student
                    rioting. It was also undergoing significant restructuring of its foreign
                    assistance program. In the Cote d'Ivoire, Houphouet-Boigny was aging and leaders
                    were jockeying for position in the succession. The Anglophones Liberia and
                    Nigeria, took up a great deal of our time and energy. Liberia was our hottest
                    concern. As the senior Deputy, I used to take over for Ed while he was away. He
                    used to travel to the region and domestically a fair amount. He had the good
                    sense to get out there to show the flag in the entire region and to have a
                    better feel for it. Our extensive assets in Liberia, the VOA facility, the
                    diplomatic telecommunications relay facility, and the Omega navigation station
                    were a key concern in the region. These were the greatest aggregation of
                    American assets of any country in sub-Saharan Africa. I was the acting director,
                    AF/W. There was an coup against Samuel Doe's government in October of 1985. Jim
                    Bishop was managing the crisis for the AF bureau, and Ed was now Ambassador in
                    Liberia at this point. Howard Walker was away and I was running the show when
                    the coup took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Liberia. Quiwonkpa came damn close to overthrowing Doe. The
                    significance was not only the disruptions and repression that occurred
                    thereafter, but also the watershed for Liberia transforming from a non-tribal
                    government as it had been under the Americo-Liberians, to one in which tribalism
                    became the definitive test of loyalty. The Americo-Liberians had successfully
                    suppressed tribalism during their rule. For the first five years of Doe's
                    stewardship the nation continued to avoid tribal conflicts. Quiwonkpa, by
                    contrast, was backed by two large tribal groups. Therefore, when he went after
                    Doe's Krahn supporters, it took on the aspect of a tribal conflict. From that
                    point onward, politics in Liberia became explicitly tribal in their orientation.
                    Our concern was driven by the size of the American presence. We had so many
                    Americans there, the U.S. Mission itself was over 225, and there were about
                    5,000 American citizens counting returned Liberians who had gone to the United
                    States and obtained U.S. citizenship. So, we had a lot at risk and we monitored
                    very carefully how we in AF/W backstopped the Embassy's efforts to do what was
                    necessary. Unfortunately, our military mission chief did not handle themselves
                    very well and we had some problems deriving from his conduct..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, there was a great deal of resentment against Doe among Embassy
                    personnel because they had reason to believe that he had stolen the election a
                    month earlier, and the U.S. had been compelled to certify the election for
                    political reasons. Further, they felt that Doe was recalcitrant and
                    uncooperative on a range of issues. So, when Quiwonkpa who was a military man,
                    launched his coup attempt, our military people, in particular, took it upon
                    themselves to go out into the streets, ostensively to look after the Americans
                    living in various parts of the city. In reality, they ended up encountering the
                    insurgents who for about 12 hours or so, seemed to be on the verge of taking
                    power. They were observed talking to and joking with the insurgent forces.
                    Inevitably, Doe's people saw this as well. When Doe's reinforcements arrived and
                    put down the insurrection, Quiwonkpa was captured, killed and dismembered. Doe
                    strongly resented the American military for having “collaborated”, with his
                    enemies. Doe wasn't so sure that our MilMish people hadn't work with Quiwonkpa
                    and his supporters, and encouraged them to take action against Doe because our
                    relations with Doe were not good at that time. We prevailed upon Doe not to
                    expel these people. They were still assigned there when I arrived. It was
                    probably a mistake. They probably should have been allowed to leave quietly. It
                    would have taken one less irritant out of the relationship.</p>
                <p>What struck me when I was in AF/W, was the degree of intensity with which Nigeria
                    and Liberia seemed to dominate the thinking of the bureau whenever they thought
                    of West Africa. We tried to explain that the Francophone West African countries
                    were much more stable, had shown much more promise in many ways. While the
                    French were still influential in their former West African colonies, we could
                    have played the game much more effectively than we did. We tried to get more
                    attention devoted to these countries. Chet Crocker was the Assistant Secretary
                    at the time, and his focus was almost completely on South Africa. Constructive
                    engagement was the AF watchword and it was a challenge to get his attention on
                    problems elsewhere. The Deputy Assistant Secretaries, particularly Jim Bishop,
                    were more focused on the West Africa, and the non-South African side of the
                    continent. He was a consistent supporter of our efforts to persuade the
                    Francophones to be more cooperative and responsive, and to provide more
                    assistance where the opportunities existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are we talking about to be cooperative?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: In supporting us in the United Nations, supporting us in the Cold War,
                    and against the Soviets when they were out of line. We hoped that the
                    Francophone would stand with the West, and condemn Soviets transgressions. In
                    the Falklands War, for example, the Senegalese were prevailed upon by the
                    British to allow their aircraft to fly reinforcements and supplies through Dakar
                    to the Falklands. There was still that strategic aspect of the Dakar. We also
                    dealt with them on fisheries issues. We wanted to expel the Soviets from their
                    exclusive fishery zones, and to actually take on the Soviets. You have to put
                    yourself in the context of the time. Under Ronald Reagan, the NSC representative
                    for Africa was Fred Wettering. We used to call him “Free World Fred” because he
                    came up with bizarre ideas of ways in which we could put a stick in the spokes
                    of the Soviets, even at the expense of our relations with the West African
                    nations. He proposed that we ought to seriously consider ways to drive the
                    Soviet trawlers out of the West African coast, particularly off Mauritania and
                    Senegal, which are very productive fishing grounds. Specifically, he suggested
                    that we persuade these nations to provide letters of marque to privateers. They
                    would lease ships crewed by Spaniards or Portuguese and outfit them to seize
                    Soviet ships. We were to encourage the creation of these privateering ventures.
                    They would then capture Soviet trawlers off the coast of Mauritania and the
                    Mauritanian government would allow the captured vessels to be sold off to the
                    highest bidder. Of course, the Francophone Africans would not have agreed. Thank
                    God, we were able to quash this concept before we had to go to the West Africans
                    with it. This gives you an idea to some of the thinking that was going on at
                    this time.</p>
                <p>Again, the valuable former French colonies really were our principal focus. Niger
                    had significant amounts of uranium and provided the French nuclear its principal
                    source of uranium. The Ivory Coast has cocoa and coffee, and timber, and
                    Senegal, was of interest for its strategic location and its model of democracy.
                    We had a very significant increase in the assistance program to Senegal under
                    Abdou Diouf. There had been a peaceful democratic transition from Senghor, and
                    Diouf was a very presentable guy. He was six feet nine inches tall and very
                    dignified, poised and intelligent. He was attractive to all the donors. We
                    wanted to make Senegal a model for successful development. We were on the same
                    wavelength with the French in the endeavor. Charlie Bray, our Ambassador in
                    Dakar, was one of our most talented ambassadors, and he worked very thoughtfully
                    and cooperatively with the Senegalese. They are a very educated people, and had
                    excellent officials at the top ranks of their government. Their middle ranks
                    tended to be weak, but in terms of corruption, we considered the Senegalese a
                    cut above most of the other AF/W countries. It was a civilian governmental that
                    hadn't come to power through military machinations or by coup, so we were
                    comfortable in trying to make them an example. The two countries in West Africa
                    that we wanted to play the role model were Senegal on the Francophone side and
                    Ghana, under Jerry Rawlings, on the Anglophone side. We wanted to see them
                    succeed. We wanted to provide them the wherewithal to develop their
                    infrastructure, develop their people, their leadership and their managerial
                    skills. We had longstanding ties with Ghana going back many decades. We wanted
                    to see the extent to which we could achieve the same thing in Senegal</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>One of the remarkable things about the 12 nations of the former French West
                    Africa, at that time, five of the chiefs of state were still receiving pensions
                    from the French government for their service to the French government or
                    military. By contrast, a very significant number, we figured almost half, of the
                    leaders' families had children studying in the United States. We considered this
                    a realization of a change in the drift of allegiances which we thought quite
                    significant; it was ongoing, but accelerating in this time frame. The
                    Francophone African leaders began to perceive a disengagement of France from
                    Africa. They saw the United States having a greater and greater degree of
                    influence in the world, and France was changing its world view by virtue of two
                    things. First, their investments in Africa were now no longer as great as they
                    had once been. both in absolute terms and in proportionate terms. Its economic
                    focus was on the EU rather than Africa. Secondly, its commitment to Africa has
                    diminished with the departure from the scene of de Gaulle and many of his
                    lieutenants like Jacques Foccart, his fixer, if you will, for Africa. The
                    departure of these actors diminished France's sense of historical commitment to
                    Africa. Much of what the Frenchmen knew about Africa, they knew from their
                    personal experience during Second World War. For example, they knew that Chad
                    had been the first colony to join up with the Free French. I remember on my way
                    to Chad in 1969 a cab driver in Paris immediately recognized Chad, saying
                    something to the effect “Oh yes, my uncle served there during the war.” That was
                    fading away with the progression of time. Further, the military power and
                    economic strength of France vis-�-vis the United States was diminishing. Under
                    Reagan, the U.S. was inclined to exercise our influence and to project our power
                    militarily and economically. The Africans were beginning to recognize this and
                    it was an important transition. While we were not so much trying to exploit this
                    change, we were trying to live up to their expectations. In the contest of
                    promotion democracy and capitalism, we did implicitly encourage African leaders
                    to consider sending their children to the United States for training in
                    management, finance and economics. We felt that the U.S. provided a model that
                    they could usefully apply in their own countries</p>
                <p>In that regard, our relationship with Francophone Africa was generally positive.
                    As I say, we didn't have any major disruptions in our relationships. There was a
                    sense in AF that the Francophones were beginning to move in our direction. This
                    is in marked contrast to Nigeria with which there was constant friction. They
                    seemed to feel that we were trying to manipulate them or to push them around. At
                    that time we had a range of issues with the Nigerians. I remember one time Ed
                    Perkins went to a convention of chiefs of police in Houston, Texas. He was to
                    make a pitch to show that the Nigerians, in general, were decent people. They
                    should not automatically be distrusted and abused by U.S. law enforcement and by
                    the immigration service. He gave the best, most reasonable presentation he
                    could. He reported that in conversations after his presentation that whenever
                    they mentioned the Nigerians, the police chiefs' attitude was, “Just put them in
                    jail. I mean they're all a bunch of crooks, it's just a matter of finding out
                    which scam they're involved in.” Now, this was in the days when the Nigerians
                    were big players in credit card fraud and narcotics smuggling. They were also
                    developing the scam about the availability of blocked funds and then looting
                    American sucker's bank account.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Blocked funds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes. We received constant calls and appeals from Americans who lost as
                    much as $50,000 or more. The reality was that they lost their money because they
                    thought they could get their hands illegally on blocked Nigerian funds. We'd
                    have to try to explain the scam to them. Nigerians were increasingly being
                    detained for narcotics smuggling, which they claimed was racism. Nigeria had
                    become a way station for narcotics entering the United States from the Middle
                    East. The smugglers were shifting from transiting Southern Europe to transiting
                    Nigeria, and Nigerians were being used as mules. Then the smugglers would shift
                    the traffic further along the West African coast and the next thing you knew
                    they were coming out of Ghana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was something about stolen automobiles, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, luxury automobiles were being stolen in Europe and driven to
                    Nigeria across the Sahara Desert. They bribed the border guards and then sell
                    them in Lagos. Narcotics trafficking was so lucrative that many senior Nigerian
                    officials became involved. Despite Nigeria's tremendous oil revenues, the
                    corruption and mismanagement was absolutely staggering. Therefore few leaders in
                    Nigeria were untainted by the drug money or by the corruption from the oil
                    revenues. We tried to make the point that as the most populous nation in Africa,
                    estimated at that time at 120 million, later to be determined to be closer to 90
                    million, should play a constructive role in the region. Subsequently they did
                    play a role in peacekeeping efforts, which hasn't always been that constructive.
                    In any event, we couldn't turn our back on Nigeria. So, we tried our best to
                    work with them, with constant strains on the relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '86 to '89. Three years. Okay. Before we get into the
                        thing, what was, how did you get chosen to be DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, the ambassador at the time was Ed Perkins and he'd been my Office
                    Director in AF/W for the first year that I was there. Then he went out to
                    Liberia in the summer of '88. I had indicated to him that I would be interested
                    in competing for the job as his DCM. He indicated he would be interested in
                    having me, but it was not a done deal because it had to go through the open
                    assignment process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there, did you do your homework. I mean
                        you had been in West Africa anyway, but what was the situation, what were
                        our interests in Liberia and what was the situation there when you went out
                        in '86?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, it's very important to understand the events that occurred
                    immediately before my arrival as they set the tone for the U.S.-Liberian special
                    relationship, which Liberians constantly invoke. We were reaching a transitional
                    phase in our relations with Doe. In 1980, with the overthrow of Tolbert, the
                    last Americo Liberian chief of state was killed by a group of army sergeants.
                    This group called the Redemption Council, had held sway for five years as a
                    loose coalition. Doe had risen to the top of this council, I was told, because
                    he was the only one who knew how to type. Thus he typed the edicts,
                    announcements and notices, so he formulated their content. Increasingly people
                    looked to him to provide leadership. He was a staff sergeant. He and his fellow
                    NCOs had been living in deplorable conditions that provoked them finally to move
                    against the Americo-Liberian government. We know Doe was in the bedroom of
                    President Tolbert at the time he was killed. Whether he actually killed the
                    president is not clear. For five years this group functioned without significant
                    division along ethnic lines. The sergeants made themselves colonels and
                    generals, but Doe emerged as the undisputed leader.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>The privilege that the Americo-Liberians had enjoyed over the many years had to
                    come to an end. The Americo-Liberians, who still held positions of influence in
                    business and society, were, to a certain extent suspect by Doe. They kept their
                    distance from Doe's government. Doe's people believed that the Americos were
                    smarter and better educated than they were, and that they would take advantage
                    of them. Nonetheless, after several years of our prodding, we persuaded Doe's
                    government to take advantage of their expertise and bring them back into
                    government. The U.S. was deeply engaged in trying to bring some legitimacy,
                    credibility and stability to the Liberian government during this time. The
                    culmination of this effort was the presidential election in the summer of 1985,
                    which, while definitely flawed, was sufficiently credible that the U.S.
                    certified the results. We tried very intensely to make certain that the election
                    free and fair. We had tried to persuade Doe not to be a candidate himself, but
                    rather to let others step forward and become candidates in their own right. When
                    Doe chose to run, we saw immediately the handwriting on the wall. He was not
                    going to allow anyone defeat him in this election. Our efforts at elective
                    democracy were shattered in November of 1985, when Quiwonkpa, who had been a
                    member of the Redemption Council and had the title of general, rose up against
                    Doe. He led his ethnic groups, the Mano or Gio against Doe. They were a
                    significant part of the population in the Northeastern part of the country. They
                    moved against Doe because they believed that he was favoring his tribal group
                    the Krahn. The Krahn were considered a backward, warlike, brutish group who
                    didn't really reflect the best of Liberia. In the wake of his unsuccessful coup,
                    Quiwonkpa was captured and killed, and a number of his Mano and Gio followers
                    were slaughtered, both in Monrovia and also in their indigenous areas as well.
                    The Quiwonkpa coup attempt was an outgrowth of the flawed election. It reflected
                    a recognition that the elections were fraudulent, and that the Americans were
                    inclined to accept them simply because we wanted stability to protect our
                    assets, although we did acknowledge that there had been fraud in the election
                    process.</p>
                <p>So, this was the setting into which I moved in August of 1986. There was a lot of
                    tension in the country. There were pronounced divisions along ethnic lines and
                    there was a lot of dissention within the U.S. mission. There were a number of
                    officers both in the embassy an the U.S. Information Agency who felt that the
                    Embassy leadership should not have sanctioned that election, that the election
                    was, in fact, fraudulent and that we should have called it that way, and
                    rejected Doe as the legitimate president of the country. That was not the
                    majority view, and certainly not the view of the Department at that time, but it
                    was an ongoing concern for mission management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the prevailing view of the Department, I mean what
                        brought them to feel that we should accept this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, that gets into what the U.S. interests were in Liberia. We had
                    the largest collection of strategic interests in Liberia that we had anywhere in
                    African. These included the diplomatic telecommunications facility, run by the
                    CIA, a 20-man Voice of America relay station that broadcast all across
                    Sub-Saharan Africa, the Omega maritime navigation station, one of eight in the
                    world, and the communications support base which provided communications
                    technicians to support diplomatic communications throughout most of Africa. The
                    U.S. had built Port of Monrovia and the airport, Roberts Field, during the
                    Second World War. We had an ongoing interest in keeping these operating should
                    we ever need the port for American naval vessels operating in the region, and
                    the airport might be useful in the case of conflict in the Middle East. It was
                    considered important to maintain access to these rent-free facilities. Although
                    we did have a significant assistance program, it was not directly linked to
                    paying for these facilities.</p>
                <p>The irony in our role in Liberia at that time was, as I mentioned earlier of
                    having served with Dick Moose in his early days in the AF bureau and his
                    distaste for the sale of F-5s to Sudan, we found ourselves having to provide an
                    increasing amount of military assistance to Doe to keep him happy and in power.
                    One thing that Doe had promised the army, the rank and file, was to improve
                    their living conditions; to improve the barracks and mess facilities, their pay
                    and medical care. We were obliged to maintain an uncomfortably close
                    relationship with Doe, which we felt we had no choice but to continue. Some of
                    those in the embassy who were unhappy about the 1985 election results had served
                    as observers in polling places and claimed to have seen ballot boxes dumped out
                    or found ballots that had been partially burned. They claimed there had been
                    substantial fraud, which I'm not prepared to say was wrong, but I am not sure
                    that the outcome would have been different. We were mouse-trapped into a policy
                    that required our acceptance of the election outcome. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it, was the army a real army or was it sort
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, it was an army by all outward appearances, which is to say that
                    they were in uniform, and they had units and a military hierarchy and a
                    reasonable amount of weaponry. But no, it was not an army by our standards. Of
                    course, you'd have a difficult time, with few notable exceptions, to show where
                    in Africa there was an army that had a real military structure and capability,
                    and that could effectively defend its borders. Most African armies are oriented
                    to counter internal threats, and are an instrument of the people in power to
                    keep control of the government and the nation. Our objective in Liberia was to
                    try to make its military more professional. We sent Liberians officers for
                    advanced training in the United States. We had a modest military assistance
                    programs, primarily in the area of small arms, transportation and medical
                    supplies. We were not going to provide them with heavy weaponry, like armored
                    vehicles or sophisticated aircraft. They had no requirement for such equipment
                    and we didn't want to have to maintain it. We had been responsive to what Doe
                    thought he needed during this period, but the U.S. was beginning to change its
                    attitude following the flawed elections and the failed coup.</p>
                <p>I want to give you an idea about the orders of magnitude of our mission in
                    Liberia. It was the largest mission in the AF bureau. We had about 225 direct
                    hire employees, not including about 140 Peace Corps volunteers. In addition, we
                    hired almost 1,500 local personnel. More than half of them were the uniformed
                    guard force to provide security for our many compounds, apartments and housing.
                    We had an American school that went through the 12th grade. We had an extensive
                    operation not only in the capital, but also miles outside of the capital. Part
                    of the diplomatic telecommunications relay facility was east of the city. The
                    Voice of America retransmission site was out about 18 miles north northeast of
                    Monrovia, as well as the Omega navigational station.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>In addition to the U.S. government activities, there was substantial U.S.
                    investment in Liberia. By this time, the Americans had sold out of the iron ore
                    mining business at LAMCO, the Bomi Hills deposits had played out, and the Mano
                    River mines, which had started as an American undertaking, were later taken over
                    by a World Bank consortium, had never produced the amount of iron ore that had
                    been anticipated. What they called the Liberian American Mining Company, LAMCO,
                    was now owned by Electrolux of Sweden. Their mines were up in the Northern
                    region near the Guinea border. While there were Americans working there, it was
                    no longer an American facility. The Germans had an iron pelletizing plant also,
                    a very high grade iron ore in Bong. So the mining sector was now primarily in
                    the hands of the Europeans. The highest profile American investment was the
                    Firestone rubber plantation at Harbel, the largest rubber plantation in the
                    world. Uniroyal had a plantation, which was later sold to a consortium of
                    private American owners. There was also a ship and corporate registry, USLICO
                    based in Monrovia, but actually run out of Reston, Virginia. It was an American
                    company that registered over 200 or so merchant ships, primarily tankers, and
                    hundreds of offshore corporations. This provided the Liberian government a
                    welcome revenue stream. Finally, there was international banking with regional
                    operations of Citibank and Chase Manhattan. They were a good source on Liberia's
                    financial dealings and the economic climate. Forestry was a profitable industry,
                    but the Americans were not significantly involved in operations. The Lebanese,
                    some Europeans and the Israelis all had active operations. So, the economic side
                    Liberia was doing reasonably well.</p>
                <p>While most of these activities were enclave type operations were you extract the
                    materials through a self-contained operation. These export operations were
                    self-contained such as the Germans operating their own iron ore port, and
                    Firestone its own export facility. Our economic interests were extensive and our
                    mission was commensurately large. The Embassy was involved in every aspect of
                    Liberian political and economic life. We had probably more people in the U.S.
                    mission than all the rest of the several dozen diplomatic missions combined.
                    Most of the Europeans were represented there. The Bloc countries were
                    represented, and, of course, the Chinese and the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>I arrived in Monrovia in August 1986. Just prior to my departure from the States,
                    I had heard that Ed Perkins was being seriously considered to be our ambassador
                    in South Africa. Since I came out there to serve with Ed Perkins, I called him
                    before I left Washington. I said, “Ed, is there any truth to the rumor that you
                    might be going out to Pretoria?” He said, “Well, nobody has been in touch with
                    me about it.” I'm sure he was correct as far as that went. The reality was that
                    Chet Crocker, the AF Assistant Secretary, was orchestrating his “constructive
                    engagement” effort with the South Africans, trying to maintain a rational
                    relationship with their government to nudge them toward majority rule. The White
                    House was persuaded that in order to forestall a Congressional initiative to
                    place an embargo on our trade with South Africa, the best course would be to
                    send a black ambassador to Pretoria. It wasn't necessarily Chet's idea, but
                    apparently the Reagan administration thought this was a way to deflect criticism
                    of the America's South African policy. The White House approached a variety of
                    potential candidates. One of whom had been the special assistant to the
                    president for minority affairs under Nixon. I had met this fellow when he was
                    the President's representative to the independence of the Bahamas. When they
                    looked into his background, they found something that made them wary. They then
                    tentatively approached Terrence Todman, now a Career Ambassador and the ranking
                    black officer in the Foreign Service. He preemptively let it be known that he
                    wouldn't be interested. Looking down the list of senior black officers, Ed
                    Perkins loomed large. So his name surfaced. I had his tacit assurance that he
                    hadn't been contacted at that time. We arrived at post on a weekend and the
                    following Friday Ed hosted a reception to introduce me to the key players in
                    Liberia, as well as the mission staff. As we were leaving the event, he took me
                    aside and said, “Keith, can we talk for a moment?” I went into the drawing room
                    and he said, “I just received communication today from the Department that they
                    want me back in Washington.” I asked, “Is this related to South Africa?” He
                    said, “Apparently. They want to talk to me about that position.” I had been at
                    post at this point for six days. I asked, “When are you leaving?” He said,
                    “Tomorrow morning. In addition, I want you to keep it secret that I'm gone.” I
                    said, “Good luck.”</p>
                <p>To understand the significance of this you must understand the role of the U.S.
                    in Liberia and the Liberian scene, particularly in Monrovia. The American
                    ambassador had a profile second only to President Doe. He was a key player in
                    every facet of Liberian life, not to say “The Pro-Consul” as they used to say
                    about Ed's predecessor, Bill Swing. Ed's whereabouts and his activities were a
                    constant focus in the local media. The Liberians had picked up the rumor that Ed
                    might be sent to South Africa. I said, “Well, we'll do our best to try to keep
                    the fact that you're no longer here under wraps.” So, sure enough he left
                    discretely the next morning. He went to the airport with the chauffeur only, no
                    flags, and my wife remained home. We tried to arrange his departure as
                    surreptitiously as possible and keep his absence out of the news as long as
                    possible. In fact, he left Saturday and by the next Tuesday the word of his
                    whereabouts came out in Washington, and the Liberians picked it up immediately.
                    There was a strong sense among Liberians that, if Ed had been called back, he
                    would be tapped for the job. Ed was noncommittal, he hadn't asked for it and
                    didn't know if he wanted it</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>To give further context on the role of the American ambassador in Liberia, I had
                    visited Liberia in 1983 on a trip with the Director General Clark, and I saw
                    Bill Swing in action. Ed was then his deputy. Bill's role was as close to that
                    of a pro-consul as you could imagine. I attended a luncheon that he had
                    organized with various ministers. They were asking him what he thought they
                    should do about a power generation problem. He said, all you have to do is this,
                    this and this. His advice was sound, but essentially he was telling them how to
                    run their government. The Liberian officials were almost taking notes on how to
                    go about solving the problem. They would later invoke the fact that the American
                    ambassador had told them this is the way to do it. That was accepted practice.
                    At that time Doe had agreed to bring some of the more talented Americo-Liberians
                    who were willing into his government. They were people who had some sense of the
                    right way of doing things, but they wanted to get the Americans' perspective on
                    issues. So, decisions were often made in this manner. Ed Perkins was now playing
                    that role and, all of a sudden, he's being tapped to serve elsewhere. It would
                    have a significant impact on our bilateral relations. It certainly was a matter
                    of concern to me. I'd been in country barely seven days and I'm given charge of
                    the largest mission in Africa. Again, I was outranked by all the agency heads
                    and by the Admin Counselor. But we had an excellent staff across the board, and
                    everything seemed to fall into place. We carried off Ed's absence, and he
                    returned in about ten days, and I asked him how it went. He said, “Well, I had a
                    sequence of interviews of the White House staff starting with their personnel
                    people on up the chain.” He met with Deaver and then James Baker, who was at
                    that time a senior Special Assistant to the President. Eventually he met with
                    the president. By that time he had obviously been given the Good Housekeeping
                    seal, and the deal was done. He said the decision was close hold and was not to
                    be revealed in any manner. So, we had to conduct ourselves as if there would be
                    no change of leadership. This agreed tactic was to allow the White House to
                    announce the nomination at the critical moment as the Congress moved forward the
                    legislation imposing sanctions on the minority regime in South Africa in hopes
                    derailing their efforts. I should point out that this ploy didn't work. Congress
                    got wind of the ploy and plowed ahead with sanctions. Thus Ed went to Pretoria
                    representing a government that had just imposed sanctions against their
                    government. In any event, he spent almost a month in Monrovia in suspense,
                    awaiting the announcement. When he left Washington he had been told that his
                    appointment would be announced in a week or ten days. The suspense went on and
                    on, and he was twisting in the wind with his mission in Liberia undermined by
                    the expectation of his departure. Eventually the nomination was announced with a
                    whimper, and he was told he should prepare himself to return to Washington and
                    present himself to the Senate and to the press. He would have one more
                    opportunity to return to Monrovia, say his farewells and close out his affairs
                    in Liberia , then off to South Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>He returned to Washington and was presented to the press. While in the
                    Department, Jesse Jackson asked to see him with a group of black American
                    leaders. According to Ed's account, he knew immediately that Jesse Jackson's
                    intent was to get some face time in the media in the guise of showing opposition
                    to Reagan South African policy, but Ed was game to meet with them. They had a
                    private meeting in one of the Secretary's antechambers. The meeting lasted for
                    some time and he told me Reverend Jackson said to him, “Really you can't
                    sanction this administration's constructive engagement policy in South Africa by
                    lending your presence as a representative of your race.” Ed heard him out. I've
                    seen Ed in action when he dealt with people with whom he disagreed. He very
                    deliberately would just listen and nod, offering no encouragement. At the end of
                    his presentation, Jesse said, “Well, what do you think? What are you going to
                    do?” Ed replied, “I think I'm going to do what the President asked me to do.”
                    That was it for Jesse. He reported that Jesse said, “Well, if you are determined
                    to go, then I guess we must support your decision.” As a courtesy, Ed
                    accompanied Jesse Jackson down to the diplomatic lobby. He immediately saw a mob
                    of press at the security barrier waiting to get some kind of reaction. He said,
                    to Jesse Jackson, “Well, it's been very nice to meet you Reverend.” He turned to
                    leave and Jesse Jackson almost physically dragged him toward the barrier to get
                    him in front of the cameras. Ed is a very large man and a former Marine, nobody
                    is going to take him where he didn't want to go. He walked away.</p>
                <p>Ed knew he was being used by the Reagan administration, I believe, but as he said
                    to me, I was a sergeant in the Marine Corps, and when my superior tells me to do
                    something, I do it. If the president asks you to do something, you do what he
                    asks. That was his motivating factor, and that was that.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>He returned to post for about a month to pack up and get his affairs in order,
                    and to attend all the farewell receptions. He went to lunches and dinners day
                    after day, while I tried to get a grasp of mission activities, and to pick his
                    brains on dealing with the key players in the Liberian scene. I was going to be
                    Charg� and, this move being unanticipated, no one would be on the horizon to
                    replace Ed. So, I knew it was going to be Charg� for an extended period of time.
                    Ed departed in mid-October, and I was Charg� until I left for the U.S. in
                    mid-April to be present for the birth of my second son, Colin. My time as Charg�
                    was a very interesting period because the issue of Liberia's performance in
                    economic and fiscal reform came to a head. In the early '80s after Doe had taken
                    power and had begun to bring responsible people in to administer the government,
                    he negotiated an economic reform package with the U.S. and the international
                    financial institutions or IFIs. It was intended to rationalize government
                    revenues and ensure that fiscal policies were in line with revenues so that,
                    among other things, Liberia could service its debt to the IFIs. These
                    institutions were extending to Liberia more credit than they were comfortable
                    with because the U.S. had persuaded them to do so. To keep our promises to these
                    institutions we had to see to it that the Liberians conformed to the reform
                    program and made the promised repayments. Unfortunately, this program, which had
                    been in place for well over a year, wasn't working. During the time I was Charg�
                    I consulted with the Country Team and with the Department, and would repeatedly
                    approach the government to jaw-bone the Minister of Finance and to the head of
                    the Central Bank. These were bright, capable people, Americo-Liberians. Robert
                    Tubman, the Minister of Finance, was a Harvard law school graduate. He was a
                    nephew of the former president Tubman who was still revered by the indigenous
                    Liberians. So, Robert Tubman benefited from this aura. I used to go to his
                    office and we'd talk about the shortcomings in the implementation of the
                    program, things that weren't happening, and benchmarks that were missed. I would
                    actually take in a copy of the bilateral agreement, and I would highlight in
                    yellow the parts where Liberia had failed to meet its obligations. I'd leave a
                    copy with him so he could show his colleagues the areas of U.S. concern. I felt
                    that, in the absence of an ambassador, I had to try harder, if you will, to
                    press them to focus on things they had committed themselves to do. It had only a
                    very limited effect because of the entrenched questionable practices. So, with
                    the agreement of the country team, I prepared a speech, which I cleared
                    throughout the mission, particularly the USAID mission, which was deeply engaged
                    in this process and believed strongly that something had to be done. We would
                    fire a shot across their bow, and we had to do it in a manner that would get
                    their attention and proper press play as well. The most influential of all of
                    the business groups in Liberia was the Rotary Club which held its monthly
                    meeting at the premiere hotel, such as it was, the Ducor Palace. I would be the
                    keynote speaker. This speech would make clear that the U.S. Embassy believed
                    that the government is not living up to its obligation under these agreements. I
                    gave the speech and initially there was silence, and almost audible gasps from
                    the Liberian audience. We knew that the government of Liberia and its
                    policymakers, were not of one mind on this economic reform. They were not all
                    behind Doe's lax compliance with the program, and the business community felt
                    that the government wasn't putting its house in order and the nation's
                    credibility was at risk. They wanted to see us take a harder line with the
                    government, so they were encouraged by what I had to say. It stirred up quite a
                    hornet's nest, nonetheless. It did make it into the press, the radio and
                    television, but we had certainly gotten the message out. A few days later I was
                    called in by Senator Yancey, who was an old retainer from the Americo-Liberian
                    governments of Tubman and Tolbert, and now working faithfully for Doe. He was a
                    venerable old character, although he was probably as corrupt as the day is long.
                    In any event, he said he'd been tasked by the President to let me know that, as
                    Charg�, and as a young man not understanding the complexities of the situation
                    in Liberia, it was most inappropriate for me to take the government to task on
                    these issues of economic reform and its adherence to economic agreements. I took
                    his message onboard and said, “The intent was not to embarrass the President,
                    but rather, it is a clear expression of our position, which we have made clear
                    to the ministers many times before this speech. I had received their assurances,
                    but nothing has happened. I had the full concurrence of the Department in this
                    message.” Although I must say that regarding the Department, I had provided them
                    our intended approach, but I'm not sure how closely they focused on exactly what
                    I planned to do or how much reaction it was likely to generate. In any event, it
                    was very satisfying to capture the limelight in an effort to do what we ought to
                    be doing. We also succeeded in getting the U.S. government to focus by taking
                    the Liberians to task. Knowing that it would be a long time before an ambassador
                    would arrive, even as Charg�, I thought we had to keep up the momentum.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>That speech was in early December 1986 and, as it turned out, the Secretary of
                    State was scheduled to visit Africa in January. This was George Schultz's first
                    visit to Africa and it was going to be quite a big deal in the region. The
                    countries that he was going to visit were the countries we considered to be the
                    important countries in Africa. Needless to say he went to South Africa, to
                    Kenya, to Zaire and just before Monrovia, he was in Abidjan. Our marching orders
                    were very clear from the outset. The scheduled visit would be six hours and 20
                    minutes. We were to arrange the following; the usual formalities to include a
                    working session with the president, a meeting with key opposition leaders, and a
                    session with the mission staff and dependents. During this period the opposition
                    leaders were becoming increasingly vocal. After the flawed elections, they felt
                    they'd had a strong case against Doe. We were told to set this meeting up, and
                    we knew Doe's government would resent it. This was my first Secretary of State
                    visit and, as Charg�, I mobilized the entire mission to support the effort. We
                    stopped everything else we were doing. The Secretary's advance team came
                    storming in and took over the executive suite. There was a young woman officer,
                    perhaps an FS-03, who was on the Secretary's staff. She didn't hesitate to tell
                    me what I was to do. We prepared briefing papers for all the meetings, a last
                    minute briefer to ensure that the Secretary while on his trip would have
                    up-to-the-minute briefings on local situation in the most concise form. I
                    drafted that and passed it to her. She said, “Wow, this is pretty good
                    drafting.” I thought, well, that's a very nice from this junior officer of all
                    of 5 or 6 years in the Service. Ordinarily it was my job to compliment others.
                    The security and the press aspects of visit seemed overdone. We knew that there
                    were a number of global issues that were of concern to the Secretary, and we
                    expected that the accompanied press corps would focus very little on Liberia.
                    Sure enough that proved to be the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>In any event, per instructions, we had the Secretary's scheduled down to the
                    minute. I informed the Liberians that there would be a meeting between the
                    Secretary and the opposition leaders. It would be held in the American embassy,
                    and we had invited all the leaders of the legitimate parties to discuss their
                    perception of the political situation. We knew the president was very unhappy
                    about this meeting and his officials tried to jawbone us out of doing this. Then
                    they decided they would take another approach. They would fill up the schedule
                    with so many ceremonial events that we wouldn't have time for such a meeting. I
                    made it clear that this was not going to happen. I dealt closely on this with
                    the chief of protocol at the Executive Mansion, a distinguished Americo-Liberian
                    who had worked for Tubman. The first event was the working meeting with the
                    president and the motorcade that brought the Secretary into town took some 40
                    minutes as the airport is quite a distance from the capital. We'd go directly
                    into the meeting with the president. There would follow be a state luncheon and
                    there would be an exchange of toasts. I programmed this event down to the timing
                    of the courses and the toasts. I dictated the time at which we are going to be
                    out of the executive mansion to give us time to be at the meeting with the
                    opposition leaders at the embassy. They tried to extend the program at the
                    mansion and wheedle here and there, but I held firm. On the morning the
                    Secretary arrived, to give you an idea of the last minute insanity, a stretch
                    Mercedes limousine showed up minutes before touch down at the VIP area. The
                    Liberians said that the Secretary had to use this vehicle because it was sent by
                    Doe. The Secretary's DS people refused because it was not an armored vehicle,
                    which the chief of mission vehicle was. Doe's protocol people were insisting
                    that the Secretary ride in the president's vehicle because they were afraid of
                    Doe's wrath if we refused to use it. We almost had to wrestle these people to
                    the ground to get them to understand that security concerns took precedent. We
                    compromised and turned the limo over to Mrs. Shultz who my wife accompanied for
                    her program.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>The Secretary arrived on a U.S. Air Force executive jet only slightly late. He is
                    greeted by his counterpart, and the airport welcoming ceremonies began. I'm
                    standing there with the Secretary when AF Assistant Secretary Chet Crocker takes
                    me by the elbow and he says, “The Secretary doesn't really feel that he has a
                    very good grasp of the issues here and since he's going to be meeting with the
                    President as soon as we get into town, he'd like to have a few minutes with you
                    to go over what the issues are.” I said, okay. I sent somebody scurrying off to
                    the head of the airport to set aside a part of the VIP lounge where the
                    Secretary and I can talk. The ceremonies were completed and we were taken into
                    the VIP lounge where our people were organizing the assignments for the
                    motorcade into town. Apparently the Secretary's problem was that the flight from
                    Abidjan to Monrovia, probably 50 minutes, hadn't been enough time to absorb his
                    briefing papers. When we were by ourselves, I started to rattle off all the key
                    issues in relative importance. I spoke to him for perhaps two or three minutes.
                    He didn't say a word. At the end of my presentation, he said, “Okay.” He is well
                    known as a man of few words. He clearly had absorbed what I had to say. I asked
                    if he had any questions, he said, no. So, I said, all right, let's go get you
                    into the right car. Off we went, speeding off to the city. Crowds lined the
                    route, some protesting U.S. policy, some supporting it, probably brought out by
                    the government. We swept up to the Executive Mansion and we're taken upstairs to
                    the President's conference room. There was the usual fumbling around about where
                    everyone was going to sit. I was the note taker for the U.S. side. The President
                    greeted the Secretary, and the Secretary responded. Then Doe launched into his
                    presentation which was basically a tutorial on his view of Liberia's problems.
                    The first words out of his mouth were, “Mr. Secretary, first I have to tell you
                    that your Embassy here in Monrovia lies to Washington about what's going on in
                    Liberia, and whatever they're telling you, it's not true.” He took off from
                    there, explaining that all the problems were not his fault. He held forth for
                    almost an hour. His pitch was, the Americans don't understand the complexities
                    of the situation here. He invoked the special relationship insisting that we had
                    to give him some latitude to get things done. He complained about everything
                    that came to his mind; his unhappiness about the American military attach�s
                    during the Quiwonkpa coup, our lack of sympathy for their economic problems and
                    their failure to understand African culture. He wore himself out in the process
                    and finally his spiel petered out. He turned to the Secretary for a response.
                    The Secretary said in about as many words, “Well, I've heard what you have to
                    say and I appreciate your concerns, but I still think it's not working here and
                    you're going to have to try harder.” Doe was stunned. He again launched his
                    appeal for understanding for another 15 or 20 minutes. At the end, Doe again
                    turned to the Secretary who said, “Well, fine, but I think we're both going to
                    have to do more. I'm prepared to have the Administrator of AID come back here
                    and work out an achievable program with you.” Well, Doe saw this as a positive
                    thing, as it gave his problems a higher profile. The Americans were sending the
                    head of the entire AID organization back to take another look. Doe thought he
                    would be able to persuade AID Administrator McPherson, who had accompanied
                    Shultz, to cut the Liberians more slack. It was left at that, and Doe seemed to
                    be somewhat mollified, at least he had had a chance to say his piece.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>As an Africanist, I can tell you that this is basically how meetings with African
                    chiefs of state play out. They usually hold forth at length about the need to
                    understand the unique local situation, their culture and their history, as well
                    as the background of the current situation. Further, they plead that you be
                    patient with them as all their problems are not their fault. Doe had basically
                    played out his role. We then moved on to the massive luncheon they laid on.
                    There were hundreds of Doe's retainers. The lunch began, and as the Secretary
                    had requested, the toasts were exchanged at beginning. As the meal went on, Doe
                    had a very animated conversation with the Secretary. I was thankful that Chet
                    Crocker was available to the Secretary. As the lunch began to wind up, the
                    Liberians dragged out the interval between the last course and the dessert. I
                    buttoned holed of the chief of protocol and told him it is now 2:10 and we are
                    going to be out of here by 2:20. If the desserts are not out here now, I am just
                    going to take the Secretary out of here and it's going to be very embarrassing
                    to everyone.” He ran back and they finished up with last course, and the
                    Secretary left on time. We returned to the embassy and met with the opposition
                    leaders who essentially did the same thing that Doe had done, telling him their
                    version of the political situation. He heard them out but had very little to
                    say. He said, “Well, we do support the concept of a multiparty democracy. We
                    would hope that you would have a legitimate role and that you will act
                    responsibly when you do.” He said the things he should have said, and they had
                    their chance to talk to the American Secretary of State, and that was fine for
                    all parties.</p>
                <p>The Secretary had asked to have a chance to talk to all the Americans serving in
                    the mission. We all massed in the courtyard in front of the embassy building. He
                    and his wife Obie, an absolutely delightful person who regrettably died a couple
                    of years ago, came out on the steps. My wife had taken Obie around town, and she
                    couldn't have been more gracious, interested and pleasant. The Secretary said,
                    “I have nothing formal to say. I just want to tell you how much I appreciate
                    your efforts. I understand something of the hardships that you go through.” He
                    then shook hands and had photos taken all around. It was a brilliant gesture.
                    Our people couldn't have asked for more. He made a point of talking to the
                    Marines who made a presentation of a T-shirt because Shultz was a former Marine.
                    . Then we swept out of the compound for the airport where there was to be a
                    presentation of grand Boubous from various tribal groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are those?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: They are the ceremonial dress of the paramount chiefs. The robes have
                    elaborate embroidery that signifies the status of the individual. By now, time
                    was running short, and we had pushed the schedule to the absolute limit. I'm
                    radioed to our advance group at the airport because it was a 45-minute trip. I
                    was in the car with the Assistant Secretary, Chet Crocker and I instructed our
                    people how it was going to work. The group that we had agreed to present the
                    boubous would get to gown Shultz and the others can just hand him the gowns and
                    have a photo taken. We are not going to have him take off one boubou and put
                    another one and take that one off and put a third. We don't have the time to do
                    that, nor should the Secretary have to go through that. I suspect that I made
                    some points with Chet by making such command decisions on the spot and having
                    things done properly. We saw the Secretary off in his Boubou, and he turned and
                    thanked us all. We had a great “wheels up” party afterward, as we and we felt a
                    great sense of achievement and relief. The promise to have McPherson return with
                    a team was a tangible result.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>McPherson returned in three weeks with a high-level team including Howard Walker
                    representing State. The Liberians sat down with our economic team and worked out
                    an arrangement, which was unprecedented in Africa. Talk about an American
                    ambassador acting the pro-consul, we now set up a system by which we would have
                    financial advisors in every economic or fiscal office of the Liberian
                    government; on both the revenue and the expenditure side. On the fiscal side,
                    they'd be in the Central Bank, not only with access to all of the documents
                    flowing through, but also with some decision making power as well. The Liberians
                    were in a tight spot, and it was understood that, either they cooperated or they
                    didn't get further American assistance. McPherson was with us for about three
                    days and worked very hard negotiating the agreement. We recognized that whatever
                    was agreed to, it was still going to be very difficult to actually implement.
                    The Liberians were more motivated by the fear of losing U.S. support than by an
                    interest in improving their economic and fiscal operations. Initially things
                    went reasonably well. AID hired a former USAID mission director to head of this
                    mission; ultimately 26 fiscal specialists, auditors and financial managers were
                    hired for this team. We called them OPEX for operational experts. They over the
                    next three to six months they took up their positions throughout the government.
                    The Liberian government insisted that the issue was not about expenditures, but
                    rather capturing more revenue. Of course they wanted more revenue because they
                    wanted to have more money to divert for to their own pockets. Inevitably
                    friction developed, despite a good start. In April 1987 I returned to Washington
                    for the birth of my second son, Colin. On my return a month later, I reassumed
                    the role of Charg� until Jim Bishop, who had been designated to be the
                    ambassador, arrived in July. He had been a Deputy Assistant Secretary in AF for
                    seven years. He knew the Liberia account intimately. He knew most of the African
                    countries, but he knew Liberia in particular. After Jim arrived, we restructured
                    our operations. He was extraordinary good at ensuring that I knew everything he
                    knew, particularly about all the agencies' activities. I sat in on his weekly
                    session with the station chief who was also in charge of the CIA base or
                    communications facility. They had an extensive operation there. Our CIA
                    operation had been in place a long time, and we relied on it very heavily to
                    track local events. The first station chief was a very likable guy, very
                    intelligent and intellectual, and had both perspective and poise. His successor
                    was not as experienced or as balanced.</p>
                <p>When Jim arrived the idea was to see to it that the OPEXers were smoothly
                    integrated into their positions in the hope of finally get some control over the
                    revenue inflows and the outflows. We did learn a tremendous amount about
                    Liberian operations in a very short period of time. They reported to their chief
                    who would report to Jim. We learned where the money came from and where it went,
                    and which agencies and individuals didn't pay their bills. For example, the
                    government never paid the utility company which was a parastatal corporation. On
                    the outflow side, we gained a sense of how deals were structured so that
                    kickbacks were obtained. In doing so, we learned a fair amount about the
                    peculations of some of our favorite government officials to include people like
                    Robert Tubman and John Bestman, the head of the central bank. All of them had
                    special arrangements to line their pockets, which was a great disappointment to
                    us, but part of the Liberian reality.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>While we were plugging away on the economic side, the political side became
                    increasingly agitated. The opposition insisted that the 1985 election had been
                    stolen. They presented evidence of electoral fraud to us, and the international
                    human rights organizations. They were agitating in the streets and they closed
                    down the national university. The newspapers became more critical of the
                    President. He allowed them to criticize up to a point, and then his people would
                    shut them down, or there would be a suspicious fire which would take them a
                    while to resume operations. It wasn't terribly vicious, but the repression and
                    threat was always there. Increasingly the opposition rallied around Ellen
                    Johnson Sirleaf, a forceful, well-spoken individual, who was also a successful
                    advocate for change. She was critical not only of Doe, but also of the United
                    States for supporting Doe. She criticized us for bringing in these experts to
                    try to prop up a crumbling, corrupt economic and governmental structure. We had
                    continuing dialogue with the opposition to signal to the government that we
                    would not tolerate repression against them. Inevitably, the Doe government gave
                    way to its natural inclination toward repression.</p>
                <p>Jim liked to take off in the summer months, and I enjoyed those occasions when I
                    was the Charg�. A major flap arose while he was away on his first long vacation.
                    We had heard that there had been some kind of an intrusion in the northeastern
                    part of the country by a group of exiled Liberians, and that two Americans had
                    been arrested with them. We learned through agency contacts that they were
                    detention in Monrovia. Our informants indicated these two Americans had been
                    pretty badly abused. As Charg�, knowing that one of our greatest ongoing
                    responsibilities was the welfare and protection of Americans, of whom there were
                    some 5,000 in Liberia, albeit that two-thirds were Liberians who had obtained
                    American citizenship and returned home. These Americans had contacts with the
                    Liberian communities in places like northern New Jersey, St. Paul and the
                    Minneapolis area, and in Boston, the locations where they had settled. To find
                    out about the two Americans, I went to foreign minister Rudy Johnson, and asked,
                    “Do you have any Americans in detention?” He said, “No.” I said, “Are you sure?”
                    He said, “Yes, I'm sure.” I said, “Okay.” What I accomplished by that exercise
                    was to let him know that we knew that they did have them. We did so in hopes of
                    protecting them from further abuse. By signaling to the Foreign Minister we had
                    reason to believe that they had them in detention, if they suddenly weren't to
                    be found, we would know something had been done to them. Two or three days later
                    the Liberians said, “We have found out that, in fact, there are two Americans in
                    detention.” They gave me their names and I insisted that we get access to them.
                    At first they hedged, saying that they had been involved in an effort to
                    overthrow the government, but I pressed them hard. It turned out that these two
                    Americans were from New Jersey and they had talked into this venture by Liberian
                    friends. One of them had been fairly prominent in the American civil rights
                    movement in the '60s. I suppose that the other was a friend of his.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were not Liberian Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, they were black Americans, African Americans. They had been talked
                    into joining by Liberian exiles in an effort to overthrow Doe's government. They
                    were told that, if they could cross the border the local people will welcome
                    them and would rise up against the government. They were enticed by promises to
                    share the rights to the gold and diamond mining in Liberia. So, these two
                    characters, knowing little about Liberia, get sucked into this plot. They drove
                    across the border in the dark of night somewhere on the Ivorian frontier. They
                    get through the first checkpoint, but were stopped at another checkpoint. The
                    troops thought something was fishy, and detained them all. On learning of the
                    attempt, Monrovia sent a group from Doe's executive mansion staff. They quickly
                    found out what was going on. These intruders were beaten and then loaded into a
                    truck to be brought down to Monrovia. The security officers stopped somewhere
                    along the road at night, dragged all of them out, and immediately shot all the
                    Liberian exiles. They hesitated with the two Americans and decided not to
                    execute them. They threw them back into the truck and brought them to Monrovia.
                    They stripped them and chained them to beds in a cement cell. They were there
                    for several days until such time as the Liberians felt they were obliged to
                    report to the Embassy that they had these two in custody. They had been badly
                    beaten. Eventually I had a chance to talk to these two characters. You could see
                    they had swollen eyes and cuts and scrapes all over. I tried to find out what I
                    could. All they could talk about was how badly treated they had been. I asked
                    what they had done. They explained in general terms. The exiles had told them
                    that if they returned with them they would be able to overthrow the government.
                    So, I asked, “Didn't you think that there might be some downside risk in this
                    process?” They said, “Yes, but we had no idea what the situation was.”</p>
                <p>I made a presentation to the government suggesting that they release these
                    hapless individuals, as they were not further threat to Liberia, and that they
                    were unaware of what they were doing. The government had one on us this time,
                    and, by the summer of '88, the strain over the efforts of our financial advisors
                    was building. Having guilty American citizen detainees gave them an advantage
                    that they were going to play it to the hilt. The Foreign Minister said he would
                    consider my proposal, but he clearly didn't intend to do anything. They
                    threatened to put them on trial, and that these were crimes punishable by death.
                    We did have consular access and we tried to ease their situation the best that
                    we could.</p>

                <p>The next thing we heard from Washington is that Ramsey Clark, Carter's Attorney
                    General, was coming to Monrovia to intervene on their behalf. Ramsey Clark had
                    been involved in the civil rights movement, and he knew the prisoner who had
                    been involved in the movement. He claimed that he was a very significant figure
                    who ought not to be allowed to languish in a Liberian jail. Ramsey Clark arrived
                    and I met with him. I briefed him in detail on the general situation in Liberia,
                    and explained that it was a very tense time because the government was concerned
                    about possible efforts to overthrow it. Clark was clearly suspicious that I was
                    protecting the Liberian government, and skeptical of what I was saying.
                    Nonetheless, I did arrange for a session for him with the foreign minister. I
                    believe he got to see Doe as well. Ramsey Clark, a very soft-spoken, yet
                    determined, individual and laid out the case for Doe. The President said only
                    that he would take his concerns into consideration, but nothing was done at that
                    time. Ramsey Clark left for somewhere else in Africa. About a week later, the
                    government told us that they felt that these people had been properly warned and
                    now better understood the situation, and thus they were released. I must say
                    they did fully appreciate of how lucky they were to survive this adventure.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>Another event that occurred while I was Charg� was the visit of the Director of
                    the CIA, Judge Webster. The principal objective of his unpublicized Africa visit
                    was to read the riot act to Mobutu, who had been acting unpredictably. He would
                    be coming to Liberia because of the size of the agency presence. He would
                    overnight and leave the next morning. The station set up the program with little
                    consultation with me. The station chief told me one of the events was a meeting
                    with the President to which I was not invited. I was very annoyed as I thought
                    that was entirely inappropriate, but I could get no support from the Department.
                    The station chief was a shameless careerist, and of the old school that the
                    Embassy was a nuisance to be tolerated at the margins. He insisted his control
                    of the visit was because the agency was concerned about security. I did host a
                    dinner for Webster and his senior staff. The station arranged the airport
                    arrival, and I would have a chance to talk to the director before his session
                    with the President. I had no idea what he proposed to be say to Doe that I
                    couldn't be a party to, but whatever it was, I was cut out. As I learned after
                    the fact, when Webster met President Doe, the conversation quickly deteriorated
                    from one of substantive issues to a bizarre exchange that was typically African.
                    Doe said to Webster, knowing what a very important official he was, “Mr.
                    Director, do you know that I am bullet proof?” The director said, “Bulletproof?”
                    Doe said, “Yes. I have a special grigri that I wear around my neck and, if I'm
                    wearing it, I can't be shot.” The director said, “Oh, that's very interesting.”
                    Doe said, “No, no, no. It's really true. I'll demonstrate.” He called one of his
                    bodyguards and he said, “Here, give the director this gun and then I have him
                    shoot me.” The director said, “No, no, I'm not going to do that.” Doe insisted,
                    “No, really.” Webster said, “No, I'm not doing that.” So, Doe relented and said,
                    “Well, I'll tell you what. I'll invite you over after dinner and we'll sit
                    around and have a few beers, and we'll do a demonstration for you.” When he
                    returned to the Embassy it was very obvious that this exchange unnerved Webster
                    extraordinarily. Webster is a very fine, upstanding individual; he was a former
                    judge and Director of the FBI, and now the head of the CIA. His very high level
                    entourage was, by turns, concerned and bemused. His delegation included of the
                    General Counsel, the head of the Africa branch, the chief of covert operations,
                    and the head administrative official. Everybody had wanted to take a trip with
                    the director on his special plane and now they were confronted with this
                    extraordinary problem. I have to admit, I was genuinely amused at the fix that
                    the Station Chief had gotten himself into, and as he didn't know Africa, he had
                    no clue how to deal with Doe's gesture. At dinner at my residence that night, I
                    had a chance to talk to Webster about the session with Doe. There apparently was
                    not much of consequence in the meeting except for Doe's boast of being
                    bulletproof. The prospect of return to Doe's residence weighed heavily on his
                    mind and there was some hope among his entourage that Doe would not follow
                    through. The director kept saying, “I'm not going to shoot that man. I don't
                    care what he says; I'm not going to shoot him.” I said, “Well, Mr. Director, I
                    hope we can avoid that.” I turned to the Station Chief and said, “Well, you got
                    him into this thing, you're going to have to figure out a way to keep the
                    director from having to shoot the president.” He was now very unsure what to do.
                    I said, “Well, you better find a way out because this guy may well invite you
                    back to the executive mansion and you're gong to have to follow through on this
                    thing.” I was relishing his discomfort because I wasn't party to any of his
                    closely held arrangements for Webster.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>In their consternation, and the Director had his general counsel looking at the
                    legal aspects of this farce. There was a strong sense that Doe was just
                    bluffing. He just wants to show that the head of the CIA, this omnipotent
                    organization, as Doe's knowledge of the CIA comes from Hollywood, that the CIA
                    could not kill him because of his grigri. In fact, there is some history to this
                    belief. There was another member of the Liberian government who claimed to our
                    Admin Counselor that he was bullet-proof. In other parts of Africa this sort of
                    belief also arises. I assumed that the station would be able to send the word
                    back to the President that this is not an appropriate thing to do and that the
                    whole exercise would be called off. So we went ahead with our dinner.</p>
                <p>At about 9:15 as the dinner was winding down, there is a knock on our door and
                    the guards said there's a colonel here from the executive mansion guard. Sure
                    enough, he came in and he said, “Well, I'm here to escort the director to the
                    executive mansion to see the president.” Good God, how the CIA folks scurried
                    around. Who was going to go, how were they going to handle this? Once again
                    Webster said, “I want to make this clear, I'm not going to shoot him. I don't
                    care what he does. I don't care what he says, I'm not going to shoot this guy.”
                    I thought this was incredible. Webster was invited back to the Mansion with any
                    of his delegation he wanted to accompany him.</p>
                <p>So, off they went back to see Doe, and I just waited on the edge of my seat
                    trying to figure how we were going to explain all this to Washington if things
                    went awry. They returned in about an hour and a half. I asked what had happened.
                    Webster said when we got there and Doe welcomed us up on the sixth floor which
                    is the private quarters and they sat on the balcony overlooking the ocean. They
                    produced some beers, and everybody had a beer and talked. The issue of his being
                    bulletproof never came up. Anyway, it makes for a great story. To my knowledge,
                    it is not in the public domain at this time, but it might make into Judge
                    Webster's memoirs; or maybe not.</p>
                <p>The relationship with Doe's government began to deteriorate as our OPEXers found
                    more and more corruption in the Liberian fiscal system. When they first
                    unearthed the corruption they tried to address at the operational level. The
                    advisor would say to the minister or the assistant minister, his counterpart,
                    you can't continue to do this. You must fiscalize these revenues; you must
                    account for that. The tension resulted from the Liberians unwillingness to
                    conform to the program. The Liberians would push the dispute up their chain, and
                    eventually it would come to Jim Bishop's attention, who would take the issue to
                    the President. Each time he'd see the president and he'd have to remind him that
                    his government has failed to meet the terms of the agreement. The president
                    would respond by saying, his government needed more money and more aid. Jim
                    could offer nothing because it would be rewarding non-compliance. Jim is a very
                    tough guy and he is very straightforward about it. He'd say, no, he wouldn't do
                    it. Well, their personal relationship became increasingly acrimonious and
                    unpleasant, but Jim held the line, as he was obliged to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>In an effort to rally support and to try to embarrass the U.S., Doe launched a
                    campaign which claimed that the Americans were demanding that Liberia repay all
                    for all the improvements it had made in the country over the many years. The
                    issue of Liberia's debt obligations to the United States, to the international
                    financial institutions became a rallying call synthesized in the phrase, We will
                    pay.” The Americans had built just about all of the Liberian infrastructure; the
                    power plants; the dams that provided the water and the power grid. We'd built
                    the roads and bridges, and, of course, the airport and the port of Monrovia. Doe
                    was trying to appeal to the masses by saying, see, as poor as we are and as rich
                    as the Americans are, they're going to make us pay them back for all these
                    things. Of course, that wasn't the case, but that's how Doe was spinning it.</p>
                <p>The Liberians would stage large rallies where the president would preside, and
                    kids would come forward with sacks full of pennies that they'd allegedly raised
                    to pay back the Americans. It was really an appalling show, and we tried our
                    best to counter it with facts, but Doe had control of all the organs of the
                    government and kept pushing this case. As part of that process the Liberians
                    then began to raise the prospect of making us pay rent for our facilities. Now,
                    this is an issue we had been able to fend off for many, many years. We deflected
                    it by pointing out how much we had done for Liberia in so many other ways, not
                    just by building all the infrastructure, but also by our substantial assistance
                    programs and intervention with the IFIs. We thought that we could more than
                    demonstrate that they were getting a great deal out of the mission and its
                    activities than they could receive from rents. They continued to raise the rent
                    issue, and we countered that this would reduce the “Special relationship” to a
                    cash exchange, if we became a tenant of Liberia. This argument had some impact
                    on them, but had a sense that it was time to take the offensive. All this
                    occurred as the clouds of the failure of our OPEX program became to loom</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>So, we decided to calculate what it costs to run the U.S. mission in Liberia to
                    show what we contributed to its economy. We came up with a figure of $32 million
                    a year to operate. This included our local payroll and what we expended for fuel
                    and electricity. The fuel bill alone was over $6 million. We had six big
                    generators at the VOA plant that generated power for the transmission towers. We
                    paid for electricity and for telephone service, whereas the government and all
                    its branches never paid for its utilities. We had to pay for them and we paid in
                    hard currency. So, we informed the Liberians of this $32 million to give them
                    some sense of the tangible benefit of this relationship. To a certain extent it
                    had a beneficial effect. In addition to this valuation, we advised the Liberians
                    of the technological transition taking place, as had been the case in Asmara.
                    The Omega navigational system was being replaced by satellites and ships were
                    now able to get their navigational bearings by satellite. Likewise, the
                    communications relay facility was going to satellite as well, and they didn't
                    need ground stations to the same extent. It was convenient to us to retain these
                    facilities; it was less expensive than having to launch a satellite. We
                    calculated that, as long as could keep these operating, so much the better.
                    There was one irreplaceable, or at least difficult to replace activity and that
                    was the agency diplomatic communications service facility which had technicians
                    on the ground, to service posts throughout the region. They were right in the
                    region, and they could respond quickly, and they knew the area. Of course, it
                    could be moved back to Washington, but there would be a loss of response time..
                    It would be slower and more expensive, but you could do that if you had to. We
                    told the Liberians, look if you press the rents issue, we'll just shut down our
                    operations altogether. There were hundreds of Liberians employed by these
                    facilities, as well. They hemmed and hawed, and they kept this Sword of Damocles
                    over our head throughout this entire period.</p>
                <p>As we tightened up on his government's fiscal operations through these financial
                    experts Doe became susceptible to other kinds of schemes. He became involved in
                    several money-making schemes which was a concern to us because of the potential
                    embarrassment to him and the U.S. One was the establishment of the Meridian Bank
                    which already operated in several other African countries. It was supposedly
                    U.S. based, a U.S. chartered bank, giving them access to help from our
                    embassies. We wondered with the collapse of the Liberian economy, and the
                    inefficiencies and corruption, why would a bank open here and build a very fancy
                    office building in Monrovia? We learned that it was financing a satellite ground
                    reception operation. We found out subsequently that this was about a $4 to $6
                    million project for which the government of Liberia borrowed $16 million to pay
                    for. The rest of it was to be shared among Liberian government officials and
                    those in the bank. It seemed clear that Meridian was involved in the business of
                    assisting the government in these shady financial transactions. We were
                    suspicious from the beginning.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>As a footnote, about three years ago, I was asked to testify as an expert witness
                    about how business was done in Liberia in that period to show that the Meridian
                    Bank was a fraudulent operation as best we could determine. They flaunted the
                    fact that they were chartered in the United States and they asked and, to a
                    certain extent, received our support for their activities. We would attend their
                    functions and they would consult with us about their activities. We just tried
                    to fathom why they were doing any of these things at this time in Liberia. In
                    any event, when I testified as an expert witness the question was how did they
                    do business? I testified that all of these organizations that came to do
                    business in Liberia would have to make some sort of an arrangement with Doe and
                    to the people around him. So, it seemed likely that this was the case with the
                    Meridian Bank. By this time the Meridian Bank was suing the successor government
                    of Liberia for $86 million in repayment of this $16 million loan with interest
                    and penalties. Of course, Meridian was looking for some kind of settlement to
                    recover some money out of this deal. I'm not sure how it came out, but my sense
                    is that with my testimony and that of others, it became apparent to the Meridian
                    representatives lawyer that it was unlikely that Meridian would receive
                    anything. Meridian by this time was bankrupt and it was really their creditors
                    who were trying to squeeze some money out of the Liberian government. It was
                    just one of these corrupt initiatives in this period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go back to Washington and say who are these
                        Meridian people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. They were based, they were chartered out of Delaware or
                    something like that, but their base of operations was the Bahamas and they were
                    operating. I remember one of their locations was in Zambia and there were a
                    couple of other African capitals, but they were always in the fringe states, not
                    the nations with real economic prospects. They were operators who were prepared
                    to take greater risks on loans than most traditional banks would. They charge
                    higher rates in this process as well. Their game was to hike the amount of loan
                    involved and then split the overage with the host government officials, and then
                    whatever the modest real costs were covered by in nominal repayments.</p>
                <p>I remember there was a contractor who was to build an underground water line to a
                    facility near Paynesville. They claimed it would cost $4 million to put this
                    line in. Somebody looked at the project and said it should cost $800,000. The
                    markup on these kinds of deals was often 400%; way out of line with reality. The
                    expectation was that no one would look closely at the cost to run a water line
                    for a half mile and a, $4 million? Of more concern to us was an individual named
                    Gus Kouwenhoven who set up shop at the Hotel Africa, a hotel outside of the city
                    along the beach that had a legal casino. He apparently was Swiss. We developed
                    information that Mr. Kouwenhoven was laundering drug money and what better way
                    than in some African casino in a country with a large Lebanese community. The
                    Lebanese loved to gamble, and money was flowing in and money was flowing out and
                    no one knew where it came from or where it went. Kouwenhoven seemed to be very
                    tight with president Doe. It seemed likely that he was paying Doe to allow him
                    to operate in Liberia.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>Probably the shadiest deal of all was one we got wind through the station. It was
                    a group that came to talk with Doe and exchange presents. Doe was a great
                    collector of expensive watches among other things. They wanted to set up an
                    illegal drug production and trafficking operation. They were going to make
                    narcotics and then ship them from Liberia to Europe and elsewhere. Once we heard
                    about that one, we had to decide to thwart the plan without compromising our
                    source. We handled it in such a way that we sent the word back through various
                    channels that we'd gotten wind of this scheme. The message was that if the
                    president were even to contemplate this operation that we would blow the whistle
                    and he would completely lose credibility and all the U.S. assistance. We learned
                    that the word got to him and the scheme didn't go anywhere, but this was the
                    degree to which Doe had been reduced to contemplate any kind of activity like
                    that.</p>
                <p>Let me just talk briefly about the Lebanese community. It was very strong, very
                    powerful. They had a virtually complete hold on the retail import-export sector
                    in the country. They were a very dynamic group of people. We had good relations
                    with them. We were very close to their ambassador who had a fair amount of
                    influence over his compatriots. Now, the Lebanese in West Africa, and in Liberia
                    in particular, were a microcosm of the Lebanese in Lebanon. There were
                    Christians, Shiites, Sunnis and Druze, and all the different political subsets
                    were represented as well. They lived in peace with one another there. They lived
                    good, even luxurious lives, but they did not live ostentatiously. They were
                    cleverer than the Lebanese in Sierra Leone who maintained a high profile; they
                    built grand homes, and as a result they became targets of resentment by many
                    Sierra Leonians. When the time came they were eventually expelled and they lost
                    everything. Lebanese in Liberia had the sense to live modestly, but maintain
                    tremendous assets outside the country. I once had dinner with one of the more
                    prominent Lebanese. He showed us a photograph of this 250-foot yacht that he
                    maintained in the Mediterranean. He and his family had commercial operations in
                    all of North Africa, and in Europe, and he kept the bulk of his assets there.
                    The Lebanese were making excellent money in Liberia and they had the government
                    on their side. They were making a contribution to the government and to Doe.
                    When Doe was a sergeant, he had been given credit by a Lebanese grocery store
                    owner, and he was fairly well disposed toward them. But they had to pay, too, to
                    make contributions. We had some concern that the Lebanese might transfer their
                    conflict, the civil war in Lebanon, to Liberia. This was an increasing concern
                    to all U.S. overseas missions. In part, this was because they'd taken American
                    hostages in Lebanon. We knew that the Lebanese were sending their fighters from
                    the civil war in Lebanon to Liberia for R&amp;R, to recuperate and to get their
                    heads back together. Every faction, even the most extreme factions, had
                    representatives in Liberia. Both the U.S. and Liberian governments made it very
                    clear to the Lebanese there if you carried on a civil war in Liberia, they would
                    be expelled and the good thing they had there would be gone.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>For example, at the American high school, one of our school buses was being
                    followed by some Middle Eastern looking individuals in a car. That same
                    afternoon, we reported the incident to the police, to the Lebanese ambassador
                    and to the head of the Lebanese community. Who are these people? Well, it turned
                    out to be some lovelorn teenager whose girlfriend who was an American teenager
                    who was on that bus. He was trying to get her attention with his flashy car.
                    Well, before the day was out he was hauled up before the leaders of the Lebanese
                    community and read the riot act. That was the end of that nonsense. That's the
                    degree of control the Lebanese community maintained over its own people. There
                    would be no threat against Americans. It was not in their interest to do so and
                    they certainly didn't need the wrath of the Liberian government coming down on
                    their heads.</p>
                <p>As my tour closed out, the relationship is now very strained over the economic
                    reform process, which is basically not working. Jim's relationship with the
                    president was deteriorating, and ultimately the whole operational expert process
                    was beginning to come apart. I left Monrovia in August of 1989 and by that
                    December the Charles Taylor group came across the border and started what was to
                    become the process that led to Doe's overthrow and death. What did we know about
                    Charles Taylor? The fact of the matter is we had some knowledge of the fact that
                    there was a group of exiled Liberian former political figures in Burkina Faso,
                    and that they were being supported with arms, training and money by the Libyans.
                    We had fairly extensive information dating back to the mid-'80s. Taylor was a
                    late comer to this process. Taylor had been the head of what was the equivalent
                    of our GSA in Liberia and he was. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: General Services Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: That's right. Basically it was the procurer for the state of real
                    estate, materials and services. He was, like many of Liberian officials very
                    greedy, and he dug his hand in a little too deep and got caught at it. He was
                    arrested and charged with having stolen at least a million dollars through
                    several corrupt deals. He fled Liberia and turned up in the United States. He
                    was in the United States for a year or so and was arrested in Massachusetts on
                    some petty charge, but they didn't grant him bail. The authorities checked with
                    the Liberian Embassy in Washington, who said he was wanted in Liberia as a
                    fugitive. We didn't have an extradition for his particular crime, but the
                    process was being worked out when he somehow got out of jail. His welcome in the
                    United States was worn out and he pitched up in Burkina Faso, joining a bunch of
                    other former politicians who were plotting against Doe. There, they received
                    backing from the Libyans. The estimates were that the group was never more than
                    50 or 100 people. It was unknown if Libya was acting on its own or as an
                    instrument of Soviet policy with the objective of undermining the U.S. presence
                    and assets in Liberia which were still of importance to us. In either event,
                    Libya was a very determined opponent of ours and this would be an excellent way
                    of creating problems for us.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>We followed their activities, but the conventional wisdom at the time was that
                    they couldn't mobilize enough people to create a real problem for Doe. What
                    ultimately happened is that when Taylor and his cohorts came across the frontier
                    from the Ivorian side in December, 1989, Doe's forces over-reacted. The Ivorians
                    intensely disliked the Doe government. Among other things, it was because the
                    Liberians had invaded the Ivorian embassy to take a fugitive from the Doe
                    government out of the Ivorian embassy, thus violating their diplomatic immunity.
                    Doe's people had also killed Houphouet-Boigny's son-in-law, and Houphouet never
                    forgave Doe. So apparently, the Ivorians were more than happy to cooperate with
                    these exiled Liberians coming across his country from Libya to move against Doe.
                    In any event, the conventional analysis would have held true except that when
                    Doe's military overreacted. When Taylor's 50 or so people came across the border
                    the word went out that they had arrived, the military spread out into the
                    region. They started by destroying villages and dragging people out and shooting
                    them. The victims were from the Mano and Gio group, the old Quiwonkpa supporters
                    back from the 1985 coup attempt. As a result of these actions, within three
                    months of Taylor first crossing the border, there were over 5,000 people who
                    were now backing Taylor.</p>
                <p>When Doe's troops began ravaging the region, Taylor's group went from 50 to 5,000
                    and it was just a matter of time before the government lost control of the north
                    and northeast. Our military advisor, Col. Staley, told the Liberians over and
                    over again, if you keep this up, these groups will rise up and they'll overthrow
                    your government. You cannot continue to carry out these depredations against
                    your own people. Of course, they did exactly what he warned them against, and
                    eventually it resulted in Doe's overthrow and death. So, Doe in particular, and
                    his military leaders were the cause of their own undoing, the way in which they
                    handled the incursion led to their own downfall. The nation broke into factions,
                    an extenuation of the ethnic conflict that became even more intense during this
                    time. The people of Nimba in the Northwest didn't want to be part of this
                    process. The Krahn were now under siege. Eventually when Doe fell, the Krahn
                    became the outcasts and were driven back into the interior. Only recently have
                    the Krahn been able to re-establish the faction that represents their interests.
                    The country crumbled into its ethnic divisions.</p>
                <p>In terms of what happened with American investments, on the commercial side, they
                    held on as long as they could. Firestone had been bought out in 1988 by
                    Bridgestone a Japanese company. As things got more difficult and problems arose,
                    their officials turned to the American Embassy. We said the Japanese embassy is
                    now responsible for you. Of course there were American citizens working there
                    and did what we had to for the American citizens. That had been the single
                    largest investment we had In Liberia. The successor to the Uniroyal, a group of
                    private American investors, continued to operate as long as they could, but
                    again had to pay the insurgents to get their rubber to the port.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uniroyal is that British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No, it's American, but it's now been taken up by Goodrich. When they
                    were bought out, but the Liberian plantation was bought out by this group of
                    investors and they were making good money, as was Firestone. Firestone was
                    making excellent money. They were producing not only hard rubber, but they were
                    also producing latex as well. During the time of the AIDS crisis and there was a
                    real boom in latex.</p>
                <p>The iron ore companies were having increasing problems. They were being squeezed
                    for more taxes and revenue. They were located in the Northern most part of the
                    country and the insurgent activity in that area became particularly active and
                    as a result they had continuing problems. A fairly common occurrence was finding
                    mangled bodies along the LAMCO iron ore rail line. It was revealed late in my
                    tour that, as part of the historic Liberian culture, there were secret practices
                    that would curled your hair. The Liberian Minister of Defense, no less, named
                    Graham Allison, was involved. Allison had studied in the United States, and was
                    a reasonably polished individual with whom we were in constant professional and
                    personal contact. He was charged by the Liberian authorities of having committed
                    ritual murder. When we heard of these charges, we thought he'd obviously run
                    afoul of Doe and they're trying to trumping this up. We learned to our
                    astonishment that it wasn't a set up, it was all true. He had, in fact,
                    participated along with his wife, in the murder of a police sergeant. He and his
                    cohorts had abducted the policeman, took him to a property that he owned. They
                    slit his throat and they hung him upside down and drained his blood and drank
                    his blood. Then they did what had been done in other cases; they'd take the body
                    and lay it out on the railroad line. As these ore ,trains would come by of
                    course they'd mangle the body beyond recognition, and the severed head would be
                    just taken as another part of the injuries from the train.</p>
                <p>I spoke with LAMCO, the Liberian American Mining Company representative and they
                    said, this was a fairly common thing that every year there would be several
                    dozen bodies that were allegedly killed by the trains who were actually the
                    victims of ritual murder. Sure enough they were able to prove their case against
                    Allison and he was executed for ritual murder. The concept behind ritual murder
                    is that the more important the victim that you kill the more power and influence
                    that you attain. So, a police sergeant was reasonably important. Unfortunately,
                    most of the victims were small boys, as boys have more power to convey than
                    girls do. We were flabbergasted at those kinds of events because as I say they
                    implicated some of the most senior Liberians. The death of several boys in
                    Harper in the southeastern part of the country was attributed to the mayor and
                    the police chief. They had been performing ritual murders, but eventually were
                    caught and executed. These that apparently went on under the table for a long
                    time, and some people in power probably got away with that. You might ask, would
                    the Americo-Liberians participate in that? I think most would find it as
                    repugnant as you and I, but some with closer roots to the indigenous culture
                    might conscious something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>Another area of a great deal of focus was the American community. As I said, it
                    was quite large, some 5000, and the community harbored a continuing concern
                    about the breakdown of civil order. Political agitation was frequent in the form
                    of demonstrations or political action against the government or one another. We
                    had set up a warden system that was really quite effective and, even when I was
                    Charg� before Jim Bishop arrived; we conducted town meetings in several
                    different sections of the city so the people would know our assessment of the
                    situation and we could refine procedures and communications. We also had
                    missionaries in the interior. They had representatives in Monrovia and they had
                    a pretty good radio network. We just had to make sure we were in touch with
                    them. We succeeded in making people feel reasonably secure, and aware of what
                    the embassy could and would do for them, how to get in contact with the embassy
                    and what would happening the case of a crisis. When the crisis did occur in late
                    1989, it unfolded at such a pace that most people were able to get out of the
                    way before the complete collapse of the Doe government. We had an excellent team
                    on the consular side. When you have that large an American community and many
                    close ties between Liberians and Americans, you had Americans with problems
                    popping up all the time. They would run out of money and become destitute, or
                    they'd had mental problems and we would have to repatriate them .</p>
                <p>Of course, underlying all was visas. Visas were a constant headache. No matter
                    whom you dealt with, at some stage or other, the Liberians would importune you
                    to help them with a visa. They used to say, Liberia is the 51st state of the
                    United States., why do we have to have visas at all? We're the same as you. Why
                    can't we just go to the U. S. whenever we want to go? I replied that Liberia is
                    a sovereign nation, as you always insist when it comes to issues that are to
                    your benefit, so you can't have it both ways. There was all manner of visa
                    fraud, needless to say. Jim Bishop adopted the position that whenever anybody
                    even mentioned visas, he said “I don't do visas,” and that was that. I would
                    defer to the consular officer whenever visas came up. If she said no, that was
                    no, and I would never even contemplate overturning her decision Visas generated
                    a vast amount of acrimony, and a visa refusal was a very bitter pill, especially
                    for members of the leading families. One of the more effective sanctions the
                    United States invoked against the Taylor government because of its support of
                    the insurgents of Sierra Leone, was to stop granting visas to the United States.
                    This proved to be a very telling form of reprisal against them.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>In any event, I wrapped up my tour in Monrovia in July of 1989. That spring, I
                    was approached by the AF Bureau about several different chief of mission
                    possibilities. One of the early ones was the Central African Republic. I was
                    unenthusiastic about it because the limited educational options for my sons. I
                    had two boys, the older one was in elementary school and he needed some extra
                    help, and there was no English speaking school in Bangui. So I indicated that I
                    didn't think that post would really work for me. This was not taken well in the
                    Director General's office, but I held my ground. Then there was Mauritius. I was
                    told that one of Bush's supporters from Texas (a woman of the “you can never be
                    too thin, too blond or too rich” school) was in line for that appointment, but
                    it hinged on whether her husband, a lawyer, could find work there. It turned out
                    that he could, and that job slipped away. Finally, Jim Bishop went to bat for
                    me, and another option was offered in Gabon. There was an international school
                    there because of the American oil companies. I said, “That sounds good to me.” I
                    knew that things in Gabon tended to work, which would be a nice change from
                    where we had spent in our other tours in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, a couple of things, going back. Did you find that
                        you had a problem with the Peace Corps when you arrived there because of
                        fraudulent elections? You know, the Peace Corps is idealistic people and I
                        mean as things went, I mean the corruption and all this. Could you talk a
                        bit about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, that's a good point: I should have elaborated. The elements of the
                    U.S. mission that were strongly anti-Doe included the U.S. Information Agency,
                    some in the embassy political section and certain Peace Corps staff, and to a
                    lesser degree, the Peace Corps volunteers. The Peace Corps held the view that to
                    support Doe was to encourage the misuse of money that was intended for the
                    development of the country. They expressed a fair amount of resentment about
                    this. They know the people better than we did in the embassy and they, the
                    people, were unhappy with Doe. The people knew about Doe's shortcomings and the
                    corruption of his regime, and they resented the Americans supporting Doe. Peace
                    Corps volunteers would bring to our attention Doe's abuses as well. We had a
                    strong and balanced Peace Corps program and an excellent director, Bob Jackson,
                    and he would try to keep their eye on the prize while trying to keep the
                    volunteers on task and out of politics. The object of the exercise was to see
                    what you could do to within the constraints of our program, working with our
                    counterparts to achieve our agreed goals. The Peace Corps was always well
                    received in Liberia. The Liberians appreciated what the volunteers could do, and
                    they understood that these volunteers were not only an asset to them, but that
                    they offered a form of communication to the American public as well. They wanted
                    them to have a valuable experience. There is an organization, Friends of
                    Liberia, that was founded by former Peace Corps volunteers and they try to help
                    Liberia; its people, not its government. There is a strong sense of residual
                    commitment in this group. Their PC programs were not that badly affected by
                    their distaste for the government, but they were being harangued by their local
                    counterparts about the failings and the corruption of their government.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, speaking about this, the Peace Corps in a place like
                        Liberia, is out in I don't know if you called it the bush in those days or
                        not, but you know, out in the up country. Did you all get out there much?
                        Was there in a way much to do out there except to show a presence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. We tried to get out there because both Jim and I had a
                    strong sense that we had to show the flag in the interior, as well as to find
                    out what people are thinking in the outlying areas. Our volunteers were mostly
                    involved in teaching, rural development and agriculture. We had a training
                    facility for volunteers from other African nations where you had created an
                    integrated agricultural scheme. The Peace Corps bought trainees and lead
                    volunteers to observe this process. It was a pretty basic operation, which
                    included pig and chicken production. Their waste was then used to feed a series
                    of fish ponds, and then these fish, Tilapia, would develop. If properly managed,
                    this scheme would add fish to the diet of Africans living in the interior. It
                    was a sort of self-perpetuating project because participants would also raise
                    crops to feed the pigs and chickens. It was really quite an impressive
                    operational concept, and Peace Corps used to run groups through there on a set
                    schedule. Jim or I would go up there for the graduation ceremonies or to welcome
                    the trainees. We also went out to the more remote areas as well. As the
                    bilateral relationship began to unravel; we were a bit more careful about
                    sending volunteers into areas where there might be trouble. In point of fact,
                    the Krahn region, which was Doe's tribe, there was a longstanding history of
                    brutality and violence. We kept our volunteers out of those rural areas because
                    they were more susceptible to violence than in other parts of the country. Some
                    tribal groups were further evolved than others and the Krahn were probably the
                    most backward in Liberia; ironically. Doe was from that group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about AIDS as, that's Acquired Immune Deficiency
                        Syndrome, which is now plaguing the place. Had that started?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It had just barely started to be acknowledged, but we were able to do
                    was work on education and training. We would make funds available to produce
                    videos and shows on television so that they could get some sense of the threat.
                    We focused on the basics of how AIDS is transmitted and the use of
                    prophylactics. We imported prophylactics and ensured that they were distributed.
                    I have to be honest about it, as was my experience also in Gabon, we did not get
                    the sense that the Africans appreciated AIDS as a real threat. They just could
                    not seem to get their minds around the fact that this could really threaten the
                    existence of their country, as it has since proven now to have done. The irony
                    is that most victims were from the elites because they had the mobility that was
                    an essential element in spreading the disease. In terms of their sexual conduct,
                    the level of promiscuity was not significantly different than any other part of
                    Africa. We never really got the sense that the government did more than pay lip
                    service to the threat at that time. I remember that the videos had a little tree
                    with inflated prophylactics attached to it, the relevance of which I could not
                    fathom. Generally, Africans were unwilling to talk about sexual practices with
                    us as it was a private matter, prophylactics, you know, this is part of human
                    nature, but in order to stop the spread you had to use them. I have to tell you
                    they did not take it very seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about diamonds? Were diamonds a big deal there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Not really. Most of the diamonds that surfaced in Liberia came from
                    Sierra Leone. The diamond trade there was then controlled by the Lebanese, and
                    most of the diamonds were in fields where the Lebanese controlled production
                    trade. There was artisan mining, which is to say they carve into a hillside or
                    dig into a pit to try to find the diamonds. They are not of the highest quality
                    or value, and were used in most cases for industrial purposes, but they still
                    have value. There are some diamonds in Liberia, but not really of any
                    significance.</p>
                <p>They do have gold. While I was there, Broken Hill Proprietary, the largest
                    company in Australia had one of its American subsidiaries negotiate for a gold
                    mining investment. They thought that they had a very good prospect in Liberia..
                    They were unnerved at the corruption they learned about. I was at the reception
                    when the deal had been signed and David Farhat, the Minister of Commerce at the
                    time, arriving late, said, “Did I get here too late? Has everybody already been
                    paid off, or is my share still there?” He was half-joking and half not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of corruption, was the money being peeled off
                        going out of the country or was it being recirculated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Probably both, as best we could tell. They were sending a certain
                    amount of it out through a very porous banking system. One problem they had was
                    that the Liberian dollar, through mismanagement and political uncertainty, and
                    because of corrupt practices was becoming increasingly worthless. Theoretically,
                    it was in parity with the U.S. dollar, but in reality it was trading at about
                    five to one during this time. Then the government went a step further and
                    introduced higher denomination coins. It felt that paper money was too easy to
                    devalue, so they went to coins figuring they would be more solid, but it didn't
                    fool anybody. Corrupt payoffs had to be in foreign currency, U.S. dollars in
                    most instances. Then of course they could have it deposited into offshore
                    accounts. But leaders needed a certain amount of assets in Liberia like their
                    SUVs and fancy gear, and home improvements. Where the Lebanese had the good
                    sense not to flaunt their wealth, the Liberian elites did not. It caught up with
                    them eventually because everybody recognized who was getting the kickbacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned there were a whole number of embassies there
                        from all over. Obviously I can understand why we were there, the Lebanese
                        and all, but what were all these other people doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. That's a good question. The British chancery was right next door
                    to us on Mamba Point. They had a large physical plant, but a small staff. The
                    French were across the street from us, again small staffed, but impressive
                    operations. The Italians were up the street. Most of these European nations were
                    there because the Americans had encouraged them to be represented in times past,
                    and Monrovia's infrastructure was relatively good. The Swedes were there because
                    Electrolux owned the LAMCO iron ore mine. That made sense. The Japanese were
                    there because they wanted to be engaged in economic assistance. The Soviets were
                    there for political reasons, a hangover from the bipolar world, and they were
                    joined by the Romanians. Their sense was that this had been an important place
                    for the Americans. The West Germans were there because they had a large mining
                    operation, Bong Mines. The Italians and French had very little real involvement.
                    They had some export business and they did buy some of the rubber, but nothing
                    really significant. I think they were there primarily because of its past
                    history under the Americo-Liberian regime. Monrovia was a nice place to operate
                    out of and to look out for their interests in other parts of West Africa. It had
                    good communications and, when the Tubman government was operating, the Americans
                    made sure things ran well, reliable power and water. So, they'd set up their
                    operations in those days and monitored their regional responsibilities from
                    there. They stayed on basically because the Americans wanted them stay. They
                    stayed for as long as they could tolerate the situation. The British closed down
                    soon after the trouble started in late '89, and we took over their chancery
                    compound.. The Italians and the French saw no reason to hang on and closed down.
                    Then the Eastern Bloc countries left with the collapse of communism.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about life for you at the embassy, you know, I mean,
                        the people there, was there much social life? How did things progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It was really quite excellent, in fact. It was remarkably good, like
                    the last good this before the Fall. The Embassy was well organized to provide
                    support services to the American community. Most of us were in the Mamba Point
                    area where the embassy is located. We had three large apartment buildings
                    immediately adjacent to the embassy compound. My own circumstances were really
                    extraordinary. My predecessor Len Shurtleff had arranged to purchase the
                    combined Dutch embassy and residence. The Dutch had closed down in the mid-1980s
                    and so we took it over their complex. It was just around the corner from the
                    embassy. We had more space than we could use. We could host a reception for 600
                    people, which we did on two occasions when we I was the Charg� and hosted the
                    4th of July reception. We could easily put them all under cover. There had a
                    large dining room and living room area and then we could open doors onto a big
                    terrace with an awning over half of it. The Dutch, being as thorough as they
                    were, had an air conditioning system for each level, plus a back up unit. The
                    lower level had been the chancery and the upper level was the residence. These
                    air conditioning units were about half the size of this room. You'd push the
                    button and these things would roar into action. As we had increasing problems
                    with electricity, the GSO put up a building for a massive generator that could
                    run everything in the house. You had seven refrigerators because we had to do a
                    lot of entertaining. I had a household staff of 5 people, probably one of the
                    best cooks in town and after I left he opened his own restaurant. He did well
                    enough to make his living as a restaurateur. There was a big pool at the Voice
                    of America compound, and there was a pool on the embassy compound. There were
                    all kinds of mission activities; there were the hash house harriers, the marine
                    house was a great center of activity and life for the Americans was really quite
                    excellent. With a large American school, we had just about everything. One
                    source of concern was the CIA telecommunications base, it was one of five in the
                    world. The other four are all co-located with military facilities. The
                    communicators were a group of people who rotated among these five bases, and
                    Liberia was the most backward. There was no PX or commissary, no American
                    recreational facility, no officer or NCO clubs. This group was always
                    disappointed at the lack of support services and facilities. We were told about
                    that this was a select group of technicians and communicators; only one
                    applicant in 20 was accepted, and they were virtually all former military.
                    Despite this selectivity there were no lack of problems; employees sleeping with
                    each other's wives, etc. One family was thrown out of country when the wife
                    discharged a shotgun out on the balcony of their apartment in frustration over a
                    husband running around with somebody. I must say the agency didn't hesitate to
                    apply its rules in this case, the whole family was gone within 24 hours. Not
                    only did Monrovia not have the expected perks, there were Africans all around
                    these newcomers, which unnerved some of the more insular ones. This resulted in
                    substantial adjustment problems. We had to work with these people and try to
                    bring them into the process and we appealed to their sense of adventure. Some
                    responded well, some didn't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the Liberians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: They were generally excellent. The Liberians have a great affinity for
                    the United States whether it's for real or not, which is debatable. They were
                    persuaded that we can do anything we want to do. Of course, they all would go to
                    the United Stats in a flash if they were given an opportunity. This attachment
                    to the U.S. was not unfortunately taken into account when Liberia collapsed in
                    turmoil, but the Bush Administration was unprepared to put American military
                    forces into restore order. When the killing started in December and into the
                    early part of 1990, there were five U.S. ships off the Liberian coast and this
                    task force had as many as 2,200 American marines aboard. If we'd just put 500
                    American marines ashore, the Liberians would have done whatever the Marines told
                    them to do. They had that high a regard for the American military. A certain
                    number of Liberians had served in our military at one time or another. Our
                    troops could probably have kept the Liberian factions apart and had some real
                    impact on the situation. I'm not suggesting it would have been a miraculous
                    solution, but Jim Bishop told me that the Bush administration didn't want to be
                    in a position to be seen to be supporting either Taylor, who was a fugitive from
                    justice in the United States, or Doe, a man who presided over terrible
                    repressive actions against his political enemies. It seemed like a no win
                    situation, so Bush didn't order them in. The perception of U.S. power, influence
                    and ability of Americans would have been a very important restraining factor on
                    later violence that occurred in Liberia. It's unfortunate.</p>
                <p>On a personal basis, we really enjoyed the Liberians' company. They had a special
                    handshake which we all mastered so we could be part of their group. They were
                    good company and a lot of fun, and they really enjoyed life. They really knew
                    the United States well. They knew we were open and friendly and they really
                    appreciated that in us, and we enjoyed it in them.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>Overall, I think that, while my tour as DCM in Monrovia was professionally
                    rewarding and personally enjoyable for me, it also marked the end of an era in
                    Liberia. In the months following my departure a process began that brought down
                    the last vestiges of the Americo-Liberian heyday, and replaced it with a failed
                    state that is only now beginning to show the first glimmers of hope of some
                    degree or stability. Reflecting on our role in this period, I think we sincerely
                    tried to make Doe and his government into a responsible and effective
                    organization, but we learned that there are always limits to reforming such
                    flawed individuals. If there was any error made by the U.S. government it was
                    probably to permit Doe to run as a candidate in this election. Once we
                    acquiesced in that decision, the game was essentially over. Doe made certain he
                    would win, fair or foul, and then his greed and stupidity that of his supporters
                    ensured the corruption and mismanagement that we strove to correct. Corrupt
                    regimes breed their own undoing, and just as Amin's army proved to be no more
                    than a gang of thugs and thieves that proved incapable of facing the
                    questionable military prowess of the Tanzanian army, so also did Doe's army
                    revert to thugery to suppress Charles Taylor's 50-man incursion transforming it
                    into a 5000 man insurgency in three months. Again our advice for a moderate and
                    disciplines response was brushed aside and Doe was tortured to death less than a
                    year later. The tragic descent of Liberia into chaos and death could only have
                    been prevented by an intensive and timely intervention by the U.S. with all the
                    longer term consequences that such interventions entail. Our leaders of that
                    time were not prepared to make that investment of American resources and
                    prestige, but ironically, it perhaps one of the few places in the world where
                    such an intervention would have been both welcomed and very likely hugely
                    successful.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Off to Gabon. That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 4th of October, 2002. Keith, let's start, how
                        did you get assigned to Gabon, or appointed to Gabon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I was interested in an ambassadorial appointment, and the folks in the
                    AF Bureau, colleagues and friends, said that they would pursue a mission for me.
                    I was considered for the Central African Republic. And at one stage for
                    Mauritius, and the latter had a certain appeal for me. While it was not an area
                    that I knew, and I thought it would be an opportunity to experience a different
                    part of Africa. At the last minute the first Bush administration put forward a
                    woman named Penny Korth for Mauritius. Her nomination revolved around whether
                    her husband, a lawyer, would be able to find gainful employment. Apparently he
                    could and that job fell through. Then they pressed me for the CAR and I was
                    concerned in particular that my older son who was nine years old at that time
                    would be disadvantaged because there was no English language school. I
                    interjected that concern into the system and the system apparently didn't like
                    it. Even people who knew me well and who were favorably disposed toward me, took
                    some offense that I would turn down an offer of an ambassadorial mission.
                    Nonetheless, Jim Bishop weighed in on my half, and they took another look. Gabon
                    opened up at that point and there was an English-language school the oil
                    companies. There were six American oil companies operating in Gabon. I was put
                    forward as the Department's candidate. My nomination went to the White House and
                    passed through that process. We left Liberia in the latter part of July and
                    returned to the States in anticipation that the appointment would come through.
                    As happens with many of these appointments, it got caught up in other
                    legislative activities, and it became a question of whether I was going to get
                    my hearing before the Christmas recess. Fortunately, there was a small envelope
                    of time, which permitted them to schedule my hearing. The Department ran six
                    candidates through at one time. I went up to the Hill, and there were only two
                    senators present at the hearing. One of the other nominees was Smith Hempstone
                    who was going to Kenya. Senator Sarbanes was leading the questioning. He went
                    from one of us to the other. His principal question that he asked each of us
                    was, “How come you were nominated to be ambassador to so and so?” So, when they
                    came to Smith Hempstone, he said, “Well, I was at a cocktail party with the then
                    Vice President Bush and I said to him, 'If you become President of the United
                    States, as I expect you will, I hope you will appoint me to be ambassador to
                    Kenya.'" He told it right the way it was. This approach pretty much disarmed the
                    senator. My questioning was relatively gentle, and I was pretty well prepared
                    and informed. The senators were also concerned about nominee's ability to speak
                    the language. I said that I had a full working ability in French, and that
                    seemed to assuage them. In any event, the confirmation process dragged on, and
                    we didn't arrive in Gabon until early November, by which time there was already
                    some political agitation in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in November of '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: November of '89, correct. There was a developing situation, which
                    became quite extraordinary for Gabon over time. Before I get into that, perhaps
                    I'll talk a bit about Gabon and our interest and our relations with Gabon. What
                    is most striking about Gabon is that it's probably the most French-oriented
                    former French colony in Africa. This residual French influence was really is
                    extraordinary. The French are installed in command positions in the military, in
                    the police, in the intelligence services. They run the power and water plants.
                    They have advisors, “consignee technique,” French government employees in every
                    ministry of government. The result is that they simply make sure that the
                    ministry works for the benefit of the French. In addition, there were some
                    35,000 French nationals in Gabon. At that time, the French population was
                    increasing during that time rather than declining as elsewhere in Africa, and
                    this was 30 years after independence. Historically France had a played very
                    active role in Gabon. In the post-independence period, in 1964, there was a coup
                    which unseated Leon Mba. His opponents took over the presidential palace and
                    detained Mba. French paratroopers put him back in power citing the mutual
                    defense treaty.. The French made it clear they weren't going to tolerate a
                    leader that they did not control. The French were concerned about their oil
                    revenues from the very substantial operation of ELF, which in that country is
                    known as ELF Gabon. There were Frenchowned uranium and manganese mines as well.
                    They also had a very active timber industry. These were very lucrative
                    activities and they were not going to have them jeopardized by untried people
                    that they didn't know. Mba was their man. The he got cancer and died in 1967.
                    When Mba demise was inevitable the French began to groom his successor, Omar
                    Bongo, a former sergeant in the French army. The French knew Bongo reasonably
                    well and he was essentially anointed by the French to become the president. He's
                    been the president ever since and is to this day, but from my perspective, it
                    wasn't a bad choice. Bongo is from the Bateke group, from the southeastern part
                    of the country. It probably has less than one percent of the population, and the
                    larger part of his tribe were over in the Congo Brazzaville. As a result he
                    didn't bring with him any of the animosities that the tribal divisions cause.
                    The dominant tribe, the largest single group, was the Fang, who are about 38% of
                    the population. If the Fang controlled the government, there would have been a
                    intense resentment by the minority tribes in the middle and southern part of the
                    country. In many ways Bongo was an ideal candidate from that perspective. Before
                    my departure for Libreville I spoke with for of my predecessors about Gabon.
                    They all said that Bongo was “the only game in town;” the power source of the
                    whole government. They were absolutely correct. When you visit the Presidential
                    Palace when Bongo is in town, people are scurrying around with dossiers under
                    their arms, everybody's alert and active. When Bongo is out of the country or
                    out of the city, people are literally asleep at their desks, and everything
                    seems to come to a halt. Bongo is a very bright, street-smart leader. He long
                    ago learned that Gabon's petroleum the resources, some 300,000+ barrels a day,
                    are the primary source of his leverage on the world stage. Although Gabon is one
                    of the smallest members of the OPEC, Bongo still has the money to co-opt his
                    opponents. If they get out of hand or become obstreperous, his first inclination
                    is to try to buy them off. He will either appoint them to posts overseas or
                    he'll just give them a sum of money to keep them quiet. That approach had worked
                    for many, many years.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>By 1989 this approach was beginning to wear a bit thin. The pressure for greater
                    political, which was going on throughout Africa to a certain extent at that
                    time, emerged in Gabon in the classic manner. Agitation started at the
                    university over the deteriorating campus and the students' inability to petition
                    the government for redress. The urge toward democratic reform was a process
                    that, in part reflected what was happening in the USSR and in Eastern Europe.
                    How this movement infected the Gabonese body politic was exceptional. Bongo is
                    something of a techno-freak. One thing that his money had bought him was a
                    nationwide satellite television service installed by Scientific Atlanta. There
                    was live, direct satellite television broadcast to all the nine regional
                    capitals. They received live feeds from all over the world. One of these feeds
                    in the latter part of November was the overthrow of Ceausescu in Romania. You
                    may recall that Ceausescu was first challenged when a support rally he had
                    organized turned against him. He came out on the balcony and everything and
                    raises his hand expecting the crowds' adulation and instead of the cheers, he
                    gets boos. He was flabbergasted, and quickly withdrew from the balcony. He
                    immediately faced major strikes and demonstrations. He was then deposed and
                    executed within a matter of weeks.</p>
                <p>The Gabonese looked at these events and saw an extraordinary irony in that
                    Ceausescu had been in power about the same period of time that Bongo had been in
                    power, some 23 years. They thought to themselves, if the people in a police
                    state like Romania can overthrow their ruler, why couldn't they do the same. By
                    contrast to Ceausescu, Bongo was a relatively benign ruler. Why did they have to
                    put up with a single party government? It really did inspire them to test the
                    system. As I say, they decided that this was a time to challenge Bongo's hold on
                    the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>Shortly after I arrived this issue was becoming acute. Bongo kept saying, it's
                    okay, we can work it out, we can accommodate all these different perspectives
                    and points of view without having to revert to violence or street
                    demonstrations. This approach worked for a while, then the university students
                    defied him, and he closed the university. The university students then went to
                    the lyc�e students, the elite schools from where most of them had graduated.
                    They persuaded those students to walk out and go on strike. They shut the lyce�s
                    down and went out into the streets. Then the kids from other secondary schools,
                    even primary schools were out on the streets as well. The ambassador's residence
                    at that time, as it had been since the time since we opened our Embassy in
                    Gabon, was located above what was called the Carrefour de Rio. It was like the
                    peoples' area. It had been developed first as a squatter area, now it was a
                    commercial residential neighborhood. The main street below our residence was the
                    primary route out of the capital into the interior of the country. These
                    students and local kids, unleashed from school, installed themselves on the
                    hillside just below us. They looted first a soft drink truck, then a beer truck,
                    which was worse. They started throwing bottles of soda and beer at passing cars
                    and trucks which had to run a gauntlet. From a kid's perspective, this was the
                    greatest possible sport. We were observing this from up above them. We could see
                    this whole process evolve. For a high school kid you can't imagine a more
                    enjoyable time, especially seeing these cars weaving around below them dodging
                    the bottles they were hurling down. Of course, they were taking a swig of beer
                    from time to time.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>Bongo was apparently stunned. He'd run a very efficient and tranquil regime for
                    23 years and he'd never really been challenged, certainly not by widespread
                    street demonstrations.. At first he sent the police out to restore order. The
                    police looked at the numbers of people on the streets, and realized that they
                    could not handle this crowd, so they backed off and monitored the situation.
                    This emboldened the rioters. During the daylight hours, they were mostly these
                    high school students. They started getting rougher stopping car and sometimes
                    dragging out the drivers and beat them or chase them off. Then they'd set the
                    cars on fire. That became a more serious proposition. That first night was when
                    events began to get out of control. They set fire to trucks that had been parked
                    or that were stopped by the rioters. There were three trucks down below the
                    residence that they set on fire. They burned all night long. At night he rioters
                    were no longer high school students, but rather the indigent and underclasses
                    who wanted to take advantage of the turmoil, especially because the police were
                    not intervening. Bongo had mobilized the gendarmes as well, but they also kept
                    their distance. We followed events from the residence on the hill above the
                    crossroads and could see both the rioters and the police. Libreville is a very
                    sophisticated town. There were mercury vapor lamps along the roads, and
                    everything was still functioning. You could see the police massed on the far
                    hill and all these vehicles burning below us. The rioters then started looting
                    stores across the street from us. The first shops looted belonged to foreigners,
                    Senegalese and Guineans. They were a small merchants and tailors. This attack on
                    other Africans reflected the fact that Gabon, a country that claims a population
                    of about 1.2 million people, in reality has probably no more than 600,000 to
                    800,000 Gabonese and the rest are other Africans who came to Gabon for the high
                    wages. They kept the country going. Nonetheless, they were resented by the
                    Gabonese who claimed that they took jobs away from the Gabonese, and as
                    merchants, they became the creditors. So this unsettled time gave the Gabonese a
                    chance to strike back against the foreign Africans.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>The rioting that first night came to an end when a hardware store just down the
                    street from us was set on fire. The fire ignited paint and turpentine, and the
                    flames rose three stories into the air. Finally, the gendarmes and the fire
                    department moved in before the entire neighborhood was destroyed. They brought
                    the fire under control. It didn't pose a real threat for our compound as we had
                    over seven acres, plenty of buffer between ourselves and the fire. The rioters
                    had no animus toward the Americans. They knew that the Americans were there on
                    the hill. I said to our the household staff and the family, let's not show too
                    much interest in these events, just be discreet about our interest in it. I was
                    radioing information in to the marine guard at the embassy and the security
                    officer. Most of the activity that night was in our area. The first night wound
                    down after the fire was extinguished. The next morning, it seemed to quiet down,
                    and the military were out in force patrolling the roads. I went to work, and my
                    older boy was at the American school, and my younger boy was in daycare. My wife
                    went down town to do some chores. The trouble started again in the early
                    afternoon. It really began to get out of control, so they closed the American
                    School. My son was brought to the embassy and my wife had already picked up the
                    little boy and took him home. She returned down town to bring home the older
                    boy. The three of us were all at the Embassy, and the rioting was spreading. We
                    waited as long as we could, but as the Libreville is just north of the equator,
                    the sun sets at 6:20 and its completely dark. The movement would be impossible.
                    At about 5:00 we decided we had to choose what to do. We didn't want to spend
                    the night at the Embassy because our younger son was home with the nanny, and we
                    certainly didn't want to make the trip at night. Our RSO kept saying.. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RSO is Regional Security Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right, she was a former DC police officer.. She said, “Well, if you
                    have to get back there, you take the lightly armored vehicle.” The ambassador's
                    vehicle had bullet-proof windows. It was a big Impala with a bomb proof on the
                    bottom. She said, “Here take my pistol.” I said, “What am I going to do with a
                    pistol? Who am I going to shoot for God's sake? I'm not going to take any
                    pistol.” I told her that security of the American diplomats is the
                    responsibility of the government of Gabon. She was to call them through her
                    contacts and tell them that I have to return to my residence and I need whatever
                    they consider to be an appropriate escort. Sure enough at about 5:30 the
                    gendarmes showed up with an armored car and a van with wire covered windows.
                    They said they'd get us back home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying the streets were either quiet or?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, there were groups of rioters looking for trouble, and there were
                    tires burning in the streets. We headed out in the direction of the residence
                    and then we detoured. The next thing I know we're up at the headquarters of what
                    was known as securitie mobile, the elite mobile security unit. I was surprised
                    because I didn't see any French advisors. There was a Gabonese lieutenant
                    colonel who said I should not drive to the residence in our own vehicle. Saying
                    the vehicle will get all banged up. They persuaded me to leave the vehicle there
                    and to drive in his vehicles that are designed for riots. At this point I was
                    thinking that historically Gabonese had never faced a challenge to its security
                    to this extent. If I threw my lot in with the security forces, am I not seeming
                    to be taking sides with Bongo. At the same time, of course, I've got my family
                    with me. This was a time that the family had to come first. I did want to get
                    back to the house. My two year old son was at home and he wouldn't be able to
                    understand that his mom wasn't there. So, I grilled this colonel to be sure he
                    knew exactly where I lived. I made him pinpoint on a map where I lived. I then
                    asked him to tell me what was going on there. He said, “Well, it's not unlike it
                    was last night. There are rioters all over that area. They're looting the stores
                    and our gendarmes are drawn up on this hill on the opposite side of the road,
                    but we will come in an adequate force if necessary, to make sure that they don't
                    harm you.” I figured that at least the guy knows what he's talking about, and he
                    did have radio communication with these vehicles. We were put in the van with
                    the wire over the windows following a French-made six wheeled armored car. The
                    troops were standing in the hatches with their rifles. We went down from the
                    hill and around what we called the beltway west of the city and exited near the
                    residence. We came off at the interchange and at the top and you're in the
                    commercial area across from the residence. Everything had gone reasonably well
                    to that point. There had been some burning tires along the beltway, but when we
                    came up the ramp and it was like Dante's Inferno. There were fires everywhere.
                    There were buildings on fire and tires burning in the street. There were rioters
                    by the hundreds if not thousands, and they were now looting the Lebanese stores.
                    It was one thing to steal from the Senegalese, but the Lebanese had the real
                    good stuff. They were smashing in the steel doors were trying to get into their
                    stores. As, we came roaring up the exit ramp the armored car in the lead the
                    rioters were startled and scattered immediately. But as we came out onto the
                    street, there was a burning obstruction in the road, a combination of burning
                    tires and junk. The armored car stopped and the driver tried to figure out how
                    to proceed. The gendarmes had the good sense not to fire risking creating
                    martyrs. When the rioter realized there was only one armored car and a small van
                    in our convoy, the quickly regained their courage and moved forward stoning our
                    vehicles. The troops in the armored car buttoned it up, closed the hatches. The
                    stones were hitting our vehicle and it was getting a bit dicey. The officer in
                    command in our vehicle radioed to the armored car, “Just push that junk out of
                    the way, for God's sake.” The armored car backed up and then hit the gas and
                    banged through the barricade with us following close behind. He then charged up
                    toward our driveway. Our driveway ran parallel to the road and was a fairly
                    steep incline. When we roared ahead, I was afraid they'd run over somebody, and
                    we'd have a martyr. The Americans would then be implicated in killing some
                    hapless rioter. When the armored car got to our gate, my guards wouldn't let it
                    in. There was an obvious screw up as our staff had been told about our plans.
                    There was a brief brouhaha about that, while the rioters began to pull in behind
                    us. Finally the gates opened and we rushed in. I thanked all the gendarmes when
                    we got to the house, and they immediately turned around and headed back out.
                    They plowed through the crowd without incident, but did nothing about the
                    ongoing looting. I guess the Gabonese thought that, as for the Lebanese, you pay
                    your money and you take your chances, and that's the way it goes. The rioters
                    thoroughly looted all the stores and took everything they could carry off.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>This situation continued for a third day and by which time Bongo had obviously
                    realized that he had to deal with the new reality. As I say, he is a very
                    street-smart fellow. First he let the mob satiate itself over a period of time
                    and work out its frustrations, all the while exhausting itself in the effort.
                    Finally on the third day he brought in his military in unparallel force. That
                    opened the streets and drove the rioters into cover. He established a curfew and
                    brought order back in the capital. At this same time there were problems down in
                    Port Gentile, which is the economic heartland of Gabon. At the center of the oil
                    industry with it's large port for the export of oil, especially for the onshore
                    oil. The French have a very substantial presence there. By contrast, ours was
                    modest, but also in the oil sector. The French of course were the dominant
                    presence. Ironically, Gabon was the mirror image of what we were in Liberia.
                    They were the absolute end all and be all in power and influence in Gabon. We
                    used to say the number one man in Gabon was Bongo, and the number two man was
                    the French ambassador, closely followed the Elf Gabon representative who had
                    vast amounts on the money to throw around. With there network in the ministries,
                    the Presidency and the security forces, they knew virtually everything there was
                    to know in Gabon.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>We knew that the French technicians had bugged all our phones. When I say the
                    French, I mean the French who worked for Bongo. He had hired former intelligence
                    people at the suggestion of the French government, and he had an extraordinary
                    effective and well financed intelligence network as a result. They knew
                    everything that was going on in the diplomatic community at least that went over
                    the public lines. The French ambassador was sort of a potentate in his own
                    little empire there. Prior to the riots, he had been proper in his dealings with
                    me, but somewhat distant. When the French were in trouble in Port Gentil, and it
                    became apparent that the French were going to have to intervene, my status rose
                    sharply. The French had 600 paratroopers in Libreville, as they have to this
                    day. They also have a small air transport unit there. The question was long
                    range transport. Out of the blue the French ambassador calls and asks if he
                    could come by to see me. Now, this is almost unprecedented. If there were any
                    contact with the French Embassy, the American ambassador would always ask to see
                    the French ambassador and go to the French embassy. He began his conversation
                    with, “We have a common problem here.” I thought to myself, well, yes, I've got
                    about 350 to 450 Americans, and you have 35,000 French. “Our common problem” was
                    not an issue of the numbers, but the threat.. He said that “we” may need
                    American air transport capability to get our nationals out if the situation
                    deteriorates further. I promised to let Washington know and to see what they
                    could do for you. He did send about 100 paratroopers to Port Gentil to protect
                    his citizens and their interests. They quickly freed the French Consul who had
                    been forcefully taken from his office which was then burned. They threw a cordon
                    up around European housing and gathered together the French citizens, in
                    particular. I was in contact with the American representatives there as well. I
                    asked about their situation and about their plans. There were about 50 Americans
                    in Port Gentil. They said they had talked to the French authorities there and
                    were told that the priority for evacuation would be the French first, then the
                    British, because Shell was there, and then the Americans third. These guys were
                    from Texas and they weren't going to be third in anything. If it comes down to
                    evacuation, they would get themselves out, thank you very much. And they did.
                    They arranged for one of the oil service boats that they used to supply their
                    offshore rigs, loaded all the Americans aboard and took them over to Sao Tome
                    and out of harms way.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>It turned out that, with the French paratroopers in place, the looting and
                    destruction wasn't too bad. The French were so closely tied to Bongo that the
                    rioters felt that they were getting back at Bongo by going after the French,
                    whereas the Americans were not viewed as being implicated in this whole
                    exploitation process. As the Port Gentil situation subsided, Bongo had to figure
                    out how to deal with the overall situation. He acknowledges that there clearly
                    were going to have to be some changes made. His first approach was to say that
                    the single party can accommodate different positions within its ranks of the
                    party, the Parti Democratique de Gabon. He took the position that he could
                    manage this challenge to his authority. The response of the people and his
                    opposition was unenthusiastic. They demanded a multiparty system. He resisted
                    and resisted, proposing several alternatives along the same line. As the
                    agitation continued in the form of demonstrations, strikes and boycotts, he
                    decided that he had to go a step beyond. So, he agreed to permit said, okay,
                    here's the deal, any three people can form a party. They've got to get another
                    500 signatures or something like that and they've got to have a charter and
                    they've got to make a statement. They can form their own political parties. This
                    was unprecedented in Bongo's era. His opponents, tasting victory over Bongo,
                    Immediately started to organize. They organized a bunch of friends and obtain
                    the 150 names needed for a petition and raised the nominal amount of money to
                    establish a party. In a matter of weeks seventy-three new parties were formed.
                    Obviously this was part of Bongo's plan, to fragment the opposition thereby
                    making it impotent by setting the diverse groups against one another. On top of
                    this ploy, Bongo pulled off perhaps the greatest coup of this exercise. He
                    offered 10 million CFA, worth approximately $75,000. to each party that met the
                    criteria to be certified. The money was supposed to fund their campaigns. Of
                    course, they all greedily sucked up the money. Among the 73 parties that
                    qualified, there were all manner of minority elements represented.. There was
                    one called the Party of God. Bongo's supporter gave great play to the fact that
                    this group alleged that it represented God. There were several other bizarre
                    fringe groups. There were a significant number of groups that represented ethnic
                    or tribal elements. Bongo knew that would happen, and that they would fight
                    among themselves for power. In any event, he gave the parties the money, and a
                    number of them immediately went out and splurged on material things they craved.
                    For example, the party leaders started remodeling their homes, they bought
                    themselves a big SUV and expensive gear. Bongo continued to control the media,
                    the television, radio and the newspapers. On instructions, they sent out their
                    investigative reporters to find out how this money was spent. The reporters took
                    pictures and wrote stories about how the recipients used the money Bongo had
                    given them to campaign. These exposes played into Bongo's hands and he said to
                    the public, “They accuse me of misspending the nation's resources. Look at this.
                    I gave these people money to run a campaign and they went out and bought cars
                    and rebuilt their houses.” So, he is able to turn this corruption issue back
                    onto his opponents. While this proved a good ploy, they had plenty to attack in
                    Bongo's tenure, and there was a good deal of conflict at all levels. Bongo and
                    his party hung together because they had a vested interest in keeping things the
                    way they were. In early 1990, Bongo did agree that there would be legislative
                    elections in the fall of that year allowing these people an adequate time to get
                    themselves in trouble and into conflict with one another, which they inevitably
                    did. He at least brought the disorder under control. The kids returned to
                    school, the university was eventually reopened. The university's opening and
                    closing was of great concern to us because we had two Fulbright scholars there.
                    These problems disrupted our program not only for the people at the university,
                    but whether we should bother to bring another scholar out next academic year. We
                    had close ties with people at the university as well.</p>

                <p>This is a good point to talk about what out interests were in Gabon. The
                    principal one was to support the American interests in the oil sector. Again,
                    Gabon produced 300,000 barrels a day, not an overwhelming amount, but there were
                    those who believed that there was a substantially larger amount of oil both
                    onshore and most particularly offshore. The big producing field onshore was the
                    Rabi Kounga field that produced about 170,000 barrels a day. This was a pretty
                    good size; it had been the largest onshore find in the preceding five years. The
                    sense was that there probably was more oil nearby that field. The leases for the
                    surrounding areas were coming up for sale in '91, and the American companies
                    were trying to position themselves to compete for those leases. Of course Elf
                    Gabon had been in Gabon since before the Second World War. It had greatly
                    expanded its operations in the postwar period. Elf was the dominant power, by
                    far in the local oil sector. In point of fact, Elf's role in Gabon is still a
                    hot issue. I saw a piece on the Internet about ELF and French officials
                    continuing to be investigated for payoffs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: It's been going on at least since the early '90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including a lady, the mistress of the republic I think she
                        wrote a book about her use of her prominent attributes in order to advance
                        the cost of oil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: There you go. Well, they advanced it very well. Elf obtained
                    preferential contracts with the government again and again. It owned the Rabi
                    Kounga field with Shell. Shell was the operator of that field, but Elf had both
                    onshore and offshore operations. They controlled the oil terminal and the
                    shipping and the storage. The Elf Gabon head man, Mr. Chabet was a no nonsense
                    fellow and a very powerful and influential player in Gabon because he had a lot
                    of money to spread around. Elf's largesse was possible because it was paying the
                    Gabonese about $2.70 a barrel for the oil in the ground. That was the lowest in
                    the world except for Congo Brazzaville, which was about $2.50/ barrel. In any
                    event, with that spread between what Elf was paying and what oil was selling
                    for, they had a tremendous amount of money to spread about. An example was the
                    hospital in Port Gentil. The government lamented that there was no proper
                    medical facility there, and Elf stepped forward and build the hospital and then
                    presented it to Gabon as a token of its generosity.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>I developed a fairly close relationship with President Bongo's son, Ali Bongo.
                    For a year or so he was the foreign minister until the court found that
                    constitutionally he was too young to serve as minister. He had to step down in
                    favor of his older sister. Ali Bongo had been to the States, and he was a pretty
                    savvy guy. Even after he had stepped down we would have long conversations at
                    the Presidential Palace lasting as much as two hours. I knew he was a reliable
                    conduit to the president, and we had a good rapport. On Elf's “generosity” I
                    said, “Why do you think Elf is building hospitals in Gabon? If the Americans are
                    involved in your oil sector here, they're not going to build you hospitals, but
                    they'll pay you a market price for a barrel of oil, and you can build your own
                    hospital, if you want to. Elf is building a hospital and taking credit for it.
                    But you know what this is all about, don't you?” He said, “Yes, well, you know I
                    guess that's right.” Of course the Gabonese had been so accustomed to Elf
                    providing them these benefits from Elf that many thought of it as being out of
                    the goodness of Elf's heart. It was because Elf received such an incredible
                    margin on their oil in Gabon.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>In any event, U.S. firms were competing for Gabon's oil reserves. There were six
                    American oil companies present in Gabon. Conoco was the biggest in terms of
                    personnel and range of activities. It was exploring in three different areas.
                    Exxon had partnership arrangements, but no active operations. Arco was drilling
                    test wells offshore in the southwest coast. I visited one of its test wells
                    which was then at 13,000 feet in some 2000 feet of water. Drilling at this depth
                    reflected the cutting edge of offshore technology Sun Oil had a joint operating
                    agreements and interest in exploration with other companies. Mobil actually had
                    a production operation offshore of 15,000 barrels a day. Hess was a story unto
                    itself. Hess is mostly a gasoline refiner and seller in the United States. Leon
                    Hess, the CEO, apparently decided that Hess Oil should get into the production
                    business. So, Hess sent out a representative who was a Haitian American, who was
                    really sharp and very aggressive. He analyzed the overall oil situation and
                    obtained extensive technical information. God knows how he did it; that was not
                    mine to know. He learned that the Rabi Kounga field probably had a lot more oil
                    reserves than Elf was willing to acknowledge. Hess estimated that this field had
                    some 800 million barrels vie the 350 million that Elf/Shell said publicly. Also
                    the technology being used was not the most modern and that there were ways in
                    which they could get a good deal more out of this field if they exploited it
                    more effectively with modern technology. He set up a company, Hess Gabon, and he
                    appointed the president's daughter, who also happened to be the foreign
                    minister, to the board of directors. He selected several other well-connected
                    Gabonese leaders for his board. He learned that there was a 15% share of this
                    field that was not owned by either Elf or Shell the ownership of which was
                    vague. He researched this surreptitiously and found out that this 15% was split
                    10% to the Bongo family, and the remaining 5% was owned by Bongo himself, both
                    under various levels of corporate cover. These were a form of operating slush
                    fund. Once he learned this, he explored how to make an approach to buy the 10%
                    share. He probably worked through Bongo family members. Having obtained approval
                    from Hess U.S., he offered $7.50 a barrel in the ground for this 10%.. This is
                    almost three times what Gabon had been paid by Elf. This came to $300 million.
                    Immediately Elf Gabon found out about the offer because everybody's phone is
                    bugged and they had their informants everywhere. Hess was offering President
                    Bongo, who was in the midst of this political turmoil and facing legislative
                    elections that fall, a $300 million check right now, cash on the barrel head.
                    This $300 million looked awfully appealing to him at that moment. Bongo is
                    clever enough to temporize to see how Elf would react. The Elf representative
                    and I believe the French ambassador intervened, but their message was confused.
                    Elf took the line the Americans could not possibly pay this amount as it was way
                    overvaluing the field. The Ambassador's line was more like, this would be a blow
                    to the special relationship that Gabon has with France. . But the $300 million
                    was just too good fro Bongo to pass up. Leon Hess, in person, came out with the
                    $300 million check, and the deal was signed before the TV cameras in a ceremony
                    at the presidential palace. The $300 million check is passed to Bongo. We were
                    all there for the signing event and the later reception. This was good stuff;
                    Americans 1 French 0. But, of course, there was a lot more to this deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>Among other repercussions, this coup resulted in the Elf representative being
                    canned. Actually he was recalled to Paris and kicked upstairs to a job in charge
                    of cultural and educational affairs for Elf Aquitaine. He was held accountable
                    for not being aware of the deal in advance, and not being much firmer with the
                    Gabonese in keeping the Americans out. Before he left the country, however, he
                    invited the Hess representative to a dinner party with some French colleagues.
                    Nothing but the finest food and wines were flown in from France. He laid on a
                    beautiful dinner, at the end of which, the guests went for cigars and brandy.
                    The Elf rep asked the Hess rep to come into his private office in the house. He
                    said to him, “You know you have had great success in a very short period of
                    time. That must be pretty heady stuff for you. But you know, you really have to
                    watch out if you're move too fast in this country. Things can happen.” There
                    could be no linguistic misunderstanding because the Hess rep was a Haitian
                    fluent in French. The Hess rep jumped up out of his chair and he said, “Are you
                    threatening me? Is this like a mafia thing? Are you threatening my life?” The
                    Elf rep immediately backed off and the subject was dropped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was, who was talking to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: The Elf representative is talking to the Hess representative. He
                    claimed he did not mean his statement as a threat. Ironically and probably not
                    connected to this obvious threat, about six months later the Hess rep was in
                    Miami and was hit by a car and very seriously injured. It broke both his legs.
                    Now, whether it was a connection one may never knew. But the next phase of the
                    Elf effort against Hess was not to permit Hess Gabon reps sit in on board
                    meetings of the joint venture. They refused him to allow to attend the board of
                    directors meetings. He went to the president and he asked, “What is this
                    nonsense? I bought 10% of this field I'm entitled to participate.” Elf's
                    position was that Hess was not a significant player. Bongo overrode Elf and Hess
                    did attend meetings. What Hess had done was to analyze the data that they could
                    get their hands on and established that the Rabi Kounga field probably had 800
                    million barrels rather than 350 million barrels Elf and Shell had claimed. Two
                    and a half times or more than what it was originally thought. By using
                    horizontal drilling technology, Hess knew how to do, it figured they could get a
                    lot of more oil out. So, $7.50 a barrel didn't seem like it was all that crazy.
                    As it turned out, in order to protect itself even further, Elf immediately
                    bought up the remaining 5% that Bongo owned for $7.50 a barrel as well, despite
                    having told the Bongo family this was an insane figure that had no basis for
                    reality. Hess had had great success and they began to move people to Gabon in
                    significant numbers. Having gotten into one of the existing fields, they were
                    thinking of trying to invest in other potential fields.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>Gabon's geological structure is such that there is thought to be more onshore oil
                    and even more significant amounts offshore, but the latter required drilling at
                    extended depths, through the sloping continental shelf. Along the coast in Congo
                    and Angola there is a tremendous amount of offshore oil. They have since found a
                    substantial amount of oil in Equatorial Guinea as well and apparently in waters
                    between Nigeria and Sao Tome. I'll talk a little bit about Sao Tome later, as I
                    was also accredited as ambassador in Sao Tome, as well.</p>
                <p>In any event, the jockeying for position over oil continued, and it was my job to
                    try to persuade the Gabonese that, when future oil leases became available for
                    bidding, they should give the Americans a level playing field. The U.S. was not
                    promising anything under the table, or any hospitals or any sweetheart deals. I
                    said Americans would give them the best price for their oil, and would import
                    world class technology to exploit it. The contracts would be open and above
                    board, and Gabon will benefit and our companies will generate employment and
                    revenue. That was my line. I remember returning from an ambassadorial conference
                    in Washington where Secretary Baker gave us a long spiel about promoting
                    American business. This is what I spend most of my time doing for the American
                    oil companies. I spent an awful lot of time and effort to support these firms. I
                    used to meet with the oil reps, all six-company reps about once a month. We'd
                    have a sundowner, where we would talk about the security environment and the
                    situation in the oil sector. It's may have been against the law regarding
                    collusion in the restraint of trade but it could always be justified based on
                    our concern about the security of their people, and an on operational problems
                    such getting their offshore workers in and out of the country. In any event, my
                    team and I continued to press the government to ensure us a level playing field,
                    and I would keep them informed on what the embassy was trying to do on their
                    behalf.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>I'll talk about how this situation played out, but I have to go back
                    chronologically to explain. In the fall of 1990, Gabon was preparing for
                    parliamentary elections, and then the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Our focus shifted
                    to follow instructions from the Department to pressure our host government to
                    condemn this action and to call for the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait. I went
                    to the government and made this case. They understood what we were saying, but
                    there were two problems with our position from their perspective. One was that
                    Omar Bongo had converted to Islam and became Omar Bongo because he wanted to
                    curry favor with the Arab members of OPEC, and thereby increase his clout in
                    that organization. There were several prominent Arab nations represented in
                    Libreville as an earnest of Gabon's relation with the Arab world. So, Bongo felt
                    that he could not be directly identify with the U.S. and the West on this issue.
                    Second, there was the question of what happens if the efforts to get Iraq out
                    Kuwait were not successful. Would there be retaliation against Gabon which could
                    ill afford OPEC's animosity as it was the smallest producer in OPEC? So, there
                    were both the religious and economic concerns. Gabon made a very tepid
                    statements about territorial integrity in general. As the U.S. and it allies
                    built up our force in Saudi Arabia to take back Kuwait, Gabonese officials
                    offered warnings of disaster. Then the air war began, and while the level of
                    criticism of the U.S. increased, Gabon responded by reprinting what other
                    nations were saying. The Gabonese had a general ill ease at this phase of the
                    war as we all watched the bombings on CNN. Then when we launched the ground
                    attack and quickly knocked the Iraqis out, driving them out of Kuwait, all of a
                    sudden everything changed. We became the heroes of the moment, and the Gabonese
                    could not say enough favorable things about the Americans. By this time the
                    Soviet Union was coming apart at the seams and we were the only remaining super
                    power. Thank God, we were allies with the French who had made a respectable
                    contribution to that effort, and they were not in a position to criticize us. It
                    was widely acknowledged that the American military technology was head and
                    shoulders above everybody else's. Now, all of a sudden the Gabonese were
                    congratulating us and saying, “We were behind you all the time.” They were
                    behind us, way behind us.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>Anyway, as the sole remaining super power and so recognized by early 1991 even
                    the French were now much more responsive to our interests and concerns. As was
                    the case globally, there was now more interested in buying American military
                    technology, not that the Gabonese had any need for it, but their military always
                    wanted to buy the best new toys. So, we were riding high, and I wanted to try
                    and translate that into benefiting some of our other interests in the country.
                    Beyond the petroleum sector our other interests were primarily in economic
                    development and the environment. Gabon's per capita GDP was about $4,600 well
                    above any other Sub-Saharan African nation. So we didn't have a direct AID
                    program, but we had about 100 Peace Corps volunteers many of whom were involved
                    in rural development. We were trying to persuade them to shift more of the
                    nation's resources to the rural areas. Up until the political upheaval in
                    1989-90, the system had been that Bongo designated two prominent people from
                    each of the nine provinces, to represent the interests of their provinces. They
                    were known as the “barons” from those provinces. They were senior political
                    figures, usually with strong family and ethnic ties to the people of those
                    provinces. They would take up residence in the capital and they would argue the
                    case for their province. Over time, they found life in the capital to be so good
                    and so much better than it was in the provincial capitals that they seldom
                    returned to their provinces. Therefore didn't know the problems of the people
                    and lost touch. Gabon is extraordinary in another way because it received an
                    average of 400 inches of rain a year and roads were very difficult and expensive
                    to maintain. In the rainy season the roads washed out and road communication was
                    cut off. To compensate, Gabon constructed a large number of air fields,
                    something like 45 air fields, so internal air connections were good. Even at
                    that, these barons were less and less inclined to return to the countryside. So,
                    when Bongo was pressed for multiparty democracy, he realized that the baronial
                    system had collapsed, that it wasn't fulfilling the role that he had intended.
                    He peremptorily eliminated their positions and moved them either to ceremonial
                    positions or out altogether. He did change his cabinet and brought in people who
                    were a younger and more responsive to the changed political realities. The U.S.
                    was trying to promote that concept and practice of democracy. What was happening
                    in Gabon was being mirrored in other countries like Benin and Zambia, moving to
                    multi-party systems. We wanted to promote the democratization process and I felt
                    it was my responsibility to be in the forefront of this effort in Gabon. Working
                    with the Country Team, we recognized that there was real change going on, and we
                    wanted more programs to bring in Americans to talk about a free press, the
                    democratic system and representative government. We wanted journalists,
                    political scientists and other experts to help us promote responsible
                    democracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>We had these multifaceted objectives. We were interested in expanding American
                    participation in the petroleum sector. We were promoting democracy with a
                    government that was very suspicious of that process. Real democracy would mean
                    breaking down a system that had worked very well for all those around Bongo, and
                    had been for many, many, years. He had been buying domestic tranquility by
                    paying off people handsomely since he assumed power. I would invite Gabonese
                    involved in the democratic effort. We sponsored high profile events for our
                    visiting experts. I would call on Gabonese ministers and other officials to
                    discuss the evolving political liberalization. At the end of each such meeting,
                    I would be set upon by the local television crew. The reporters always asked the
                    same questions, and I had plenty of practice shaping our message of promoting
                    democracy. I was on television so often that there was some jealousy from other
                    ambassadors in Gabon. There were 44 other diplomatic missions in Libreville when
                    I arrived which is amazing for a small nation with barely a million people. I
                    would be on television three or four times a week because made a point of
                    meeting with ministers to seek their views on the political process. The other
                    Ambassadors asked why I was on TX all the time, and I'd say because I go out to
                    meet the Gabonese leaders, and there's always a camera when I come out. Some of
                    the other Ambassadors did arrange such meetings, but I had a decided advantage.
                    After the Western victory against Iraq, the American Ambassador had heightened
                    stature and as a result, it seemed that my activities were deemed always to be
                    newsworthy. While there was some resentment in the diplomatic community, more
                    importantly, my efforts did arouse considerable resentment and animosity among
                    the people around Bongo. Clearly, those who had most at risk and were the least
                    able to function outside their relationship were my most intense critics. Since
                    Bongo's party still controlled the press, there was a fair amount of criticism
                    about the American ambassador. There was a political cartoon which I
                    particularly enjoyed and which I've saved. It depicts me with my mustache as a
                    cowboy with my guns drawn shooting in all these directions. Clearly, it's meant
                    to be the American ambassador, but, under the circumstances, you have to expect
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>I was concerned that my efforts in support of the democratization process could
                    work against our interests in the oil sector. That was yet to be determined, but
                    I continued to do all that I could to support the American companies as they
                    positioned themselves to bid on new leases that were expected to open in the
                    second quarter of 1992. These firms were all very well represented by
                    experienced and capable people. There was a great deal riding on the outcome of
                    this bidding process, and the American oil reps were on the edge of their seats
                    on how this would play out. Sure enough, in April 1992, out of the blue, the
                    government announced that a number of tracts around the Rabi Kounga field had
                    been granted to Elf Gabon after secret negotiation. That was the ballgame. These
                    were the tracts that generated most interest among the American oil companies.
                    There reaction unfolded fairly quickly. With this insider deal, they saw that
                    the handwriting on the wall. Our best efforts had come to naught. The Americans
                    could not compete with a company that is willing to make deals under the table.
                    The arguments that I was making were the classic American arguments, but these
                    arguments apparently said all the wrong things to the Gabonese because this
                    approach would upset the process in which they had entrenched interests. Sure
                    Gabon would receive more revenue, but they'd have to account for it. It would
                    now be transparent and the transparency was never something they were that
                    interested in.</p>
                <p>Within a matter of weeks after Gabon's announcement, Conoco's senior vice
                    president for operations came out to meet with the President. He alerted the
                    head of Conoco Gabon, an old-time Texas oilman who had some 50 or 60 Americans
                    working for him in three different exploration projects. He asked me to meet
                    with his VP, but he had no idea what the VP's plans were at that time. When he
                    arrived, we had a ceremonial meeting and a briefing, and then the VP went
                    directly to see Bongo. According to the Conoco rep, he said to Bongo in just
                    about this many words, “How much would it cost us to buy ourselves out of
                    Gabon?” By that, he meant how much it would cost Conoco to buy itself out of its
                    commitments. As the result of signing agreements, Conoco had certain obligations
                    like its project to computerize the ministry of petroleum. They were training
                    people in the United States as well as installing equipment and systems in
                    Gabon. Bongo and his advisers thought about it, and then said $25 million.
                    “Done,” said the VP. The $25 million changed hands shortly thereafter, and the
                    Americans in Gabon were told they had six weeks to shut down, pack up and leave.
                    It was a good object lesson on how a U.S. corporation can operate, and how its
                    employees are guaranteed nothing. Conoco said it would try to reassign those it
                    could, and the others would be let go. That was it; the closeout began
                    immediately.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>In the meantime, Arco, which had been drilling offshore in the southeastern part
                    of Gabon near the Congolese border, had come up dry several times. With the
                    announcement of Elf's success, it decided to pack out as well. Exxon in
                    Libreville was mostly involved in both Chad and Angola. The Exxon rep was
                    spending less and less time in Gabon and again could see where things were
                    headed in Gabon. Hess was there for the duration and Sun, well, it had some
                    marginal partnership operations. There position was, if anybody wanted to buy us
                    out, we're gone. Mobil had the actual production operation, some 15,000 barrels
                    per day offshore. Its production was declining however. Without the prospect of
                    larger operations it didn't make economic sense to continue. Mobil went to Elf
                    to ask if it was interested in buying Mobil. Elf did so, probably at a minimal
                    price. So, four of the American companies just closed down. So much for the
                    level playing field, and the promised American technology. It was a real
                    setback. I felt very badly about this development, but you know, there are
                    things you can do in this life, and there are things that you can't do anything
                    about. This was one of those cases. American companies could not complete with
                    Elf in this environment because of the constraints of the SEC rulings on
                    bribery. This would also violate American law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices
                    Act, and American companies knew that. Their attitude was relatively
                    philosophical. They said, Elf wins here, but we'll get them somewhere else in
                    the oil world. And that was the way it was left. Elf was, of course, very
                    pleased with itself, but the corruption was now very transparent. It was soon
                    thereafter that Elf's activities involving French and foreign leaders were
                    suspect. In 2002 Mr. Le Floch-Prigent, the head of Elf, was convicted of bribery
                    and fraud during his tenure from 1989 to 1993, and sentenced to five years in
                    prison. The press reported that, in addition to major bribes to all of France's
                    leading political parties, during this time, Elf was also paying Omar Bongo some
                    $15-20 million annually for his cooperation. In retrospect, I realize that the
                    American companies and I had little chance competing against such unbridled
                    corruption</p>

                </p>

                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He was a key player in French policy in Africa. The press termed him
                    Mr. Africa, but he wasn't Mr. Africa in the traditional French sense. Charles de
                    Gaulle's henchman and fixer Jacque Foccart was the real Mr. Africa, although he
                    would shun that title as an anathema to his low-profile style. He was thoroughly
                    unscrupulous and he knew where all the bodies were buried. He did all the
                    payoffs and he put the squeeze on recalcitrant African leaders and disposed of
                    troublesome opposition figures. Young Mitterrand used to travel around to
                    represent his dad. Of course, as the French president's son, he clearly did have
                    the ear of the president and African leaders received him with respect. As we
                    discussed before, competing with the French in former Francophone Africa was
                    virtually a no win situation for the Americans. French diplomacy in Africa has
                    always been personal, which is to say it revolves around the relationship
                    between the French president and the African leaders. African chiefs of states
                    can call the president of France anytime and can expect to speak to him directly
                    and say, “I've got a problem that needs to be addressed immediately.” The
                    president can react without any constraints from a Congress or a bureaucracy,
                    and he usually did something for them. He doesn't have to worry about the
                    chamber of deputies or about the French public. That's how it worked. The
                    Americans can't compete with that approach. I know of cases where African chiefs
                    of state tried to call the White House, and even the fantastic White House
                    switchboard didn't seem to know who they were or what to do. The White House
                    would pawn them off on somebody in the State Department. Chiefs of state want to
                    talk to other chiefs of state, which is understandable. We never could compete
                    with the French in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A significant portion of the money that Elf was producing
                        ended in the coffers of the French Socialist Party.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: True, but largely because the socialists were in power and were in a
                    position to be helpful to Elf. Apparently, Elf favored the conservatives, but
                    they spread their payoffs widely. I can give you some sense about how the money
                    flowed in Gabon. Bongo divorced his wife of many years. Remarkably, we had in
                    our files visa applications for both Bongo and his wife, including their
                    marriage certificate. These documents were related to their daughters having
                    studied in the United States. Mrs. Bongo was described on the French marriage
                    certificate as a menaguese, which is a housekeeper, and he was an army sergeant.
                    They had been husband and wife for a long time and produced at least four
                    children, although Bongo was rumored to have sired some 50 children. By the late
                    1980s and he decided he wanted to be rid of her. By this time, she was spending
                    a great deal of her time in Los Angeles where she owned a big mansion. Bongo had
                    decided, apparently for “reasons of state” to marry the daughter of Sassou
                    Nguesso, the President of Congo Brazzaville. This decision raised all kinds of
                    questions in Libreville: Why does he have to go outside his own country to get a
                    wife? Was it right to divorce his first wife? Does this show that he's not
                    really Gabonese, he's really Congolese because most of his tribal group is
                    located in the Congo. Despite the heat, there was a big marriage ceremony. In
                    anticipation, Bongo built her a grand mansion just outside of the Libreville
                    beltway near the airport. A member of our embassy knew somebody who was an
                    architect/contractor for this mansion. Bongo bought the best of everything from
                    throughout the world. The mansion had gold bathroom fixtures and marble spa
                    baths and indoor fountains. They installed extraordinary antique wall hangings
                    as draperies and enormous Italian chandeliers. Bongo willingly paid for all
                    these elaborate decorations that the designer proposed, but on the condition
                    that he be given, one fully appointed room as a cadeau, as a gift, for free. Of
                    course the decorators just jack up their price on everything else and gave him
                    his “free” room. Among other features, there was a half-mile tunnel that ran
                    from this mansion to the French military compound at the airport. Should the
                    political situation turn against him, Bongo could always rely upon the 600
                    French paratroopers that he knew the French would deploy to protect him. Now,
                    what other nation represented in Libreville could compete with that? Bongo knew
                    that the Americans were not going to save his skin if events turned against him.
                    Unfortunately we, as a nation, failed in our mission of economic reform and
                    political in Liberia where, if we had the political will, we could have made a
                    difference, but we did not. The French would have shown that political will as
                    they had when they Bongo's predecessor, Leon Mba, back on the throne, but the
                    Americans would probably not have done so, and Bongo realized that.</p>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: One of the really great things about being an American ambassador in
                    Africa, especially at that time following the decisive victory in Kuwait
                    demonstrating that we were the only remaining super power, we could pretty much
                    write our own ticket. This was true both in country and from the Washington
                    perspective, as long as we didn't go way off the track. We were promoting
                    democracy and a free press, and we carefully reported on what we were trying to
                    achieve. In part this was to generate support for more USIA grantees to come to
                    make presentations on issues like a free press. Ambassadorships in the AF bureau
                    were particularly rewarding because you had considerable latitude to set your
                    own agenda and experiment with initiatives generated within the Mission. I would
                    call on the country team to come up with ideas for such initiatives and we would
                    work out how to make them work. .Perhaps the only area which we didn't do as
                    much as we might have was to use our public affairs capabilities to promote the
                    positive benefits to Gabon of working with the American petroleum companies.
                    That said, I'm not sure how much influence this effort might have had to offset
                    Elf's hefty payoffs.</p>

                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Concerning my presentation of credentials, the Gabonese are much given
                    to ceremony and such formalities. Obviously they took this from the French. On
                    the day of the presentation, the chief of protocol came to my house with a big
                    black Mercedes with the American flag on it to use for the ceremony. We were
                    escorted by a phalanx of motorcycles. This is a wealthy country, and Bongo
                    wanted to flaunt it. Such ceremonies gave him the chance to impress both the
                    foreign representatives and his own people. We sweep up to his palace, which
                    overlooks the estuary, the inlet from the sea. On the vast ceremonial plaza
                    along side the palace the troops all lined up on the side, came to attention and
                    both national anthems were played. I entered the palace and the chief of
                    protocol escorted me and the country team into a beautiful reception area. The
                    amount of money Bongo spent on his various palaces just boggles the mind. He had
                    a penchant to Moorish tiles and woodwork, and the reception room was not unlike
                    what you might see in certain parts of Spain in the days of the Moorish Empire.
                    The TV camera lights went on and I presented my letters of credence and recall,
                    and then gave my speech. Bongo responded warmly and we were ushered into a room
                    fro a brief chat. Bongo as an individual is a really intriguing guy. I used to
                    call on him about every other month. I didn't want to overdo it, and I knew I
                    had a channel to him through his son. He was always cordial and relaxed. He
                    could be ironic, and he seldom showed irritation. He had a reasonably good sense
                    of humor. He maintained his perspective and projected that he felt secure and in
                    control. Once he had gotten the political process back under control by agreeing
                    to a multiparty system by fragmenting the opposition and thereby ensuring its
                    ineffectiveness, he had nothing to fear.</p>
                <p>As an example of that, a congressman from California, Ron Dellums, came to
                    Libreville for some unspecified purpose. We received communication from Dellums'
                    office in Washington that he would be coming about this time, but they were very
                    vague about the purpose. I pressed them, and they deflected my inquiries, but
                    they did agree I would meet him at the airport. When I met him at the airport,
                    and later briefed him at my office, he still wouldn't tell me why he wanted to
                    see Bongo. I expressed appreciation for my background briefing and was ushered
                    off by the Gabonese who looked after his accommodations. He had a private
                    session with Bongo and I was invited to join Bongo and Dellums immediately after
                    their meeting. During the very convivial lunch in which we discussed Gabonese
                    politics, I explained to Dellums who didn't speak French, about Bongo's ploy of
                    granting each opposition party 20 million CFA. Dellums immediately grasped the
                    genius in this move and admired Bongo all the more for it. He said this shows a
                    high degree of finesse. As an ambassador or as an FSO, you have occasion to
                    observe how American and foreign political leaders interact, and you learn that
                    politicians get together, no matter what their background or linguistic
                    obstacles exist , they understand one another better than we'll ever probably
                    understand them. Dellums could instantly understand the brilliance of Bongo's
                    ploy, the object of which was to stay on top of the pile. Bongo had assured
                    himself that that would be the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>Bongo was always quite decent to me, even while those around him were instigating
                    stories critical of our democratization efforts. He was a very down to earth and
                    seemingly candid on the issues I raised. I tempered my requests to call upon him
                    as I knew that it always caused consternation among the ever-suspicious French.
                    The French were beginning to disseminate rumors that the Americans were trying
                    to displace them in Gabon. In fact, it was the furthest thing from our minds. I
                    tried to persuade the Gabonese that this was not the case. I made clear that we
                    would like to be a cooperative partner in a variety of areas, but I had no
                    intention replacing French influence or presence. Clearly the American people
                    had little knowledge of the country and no interest in getting further involved
                    there. I'm not entirely sure how Bongo saw it. I think he was probably more
                    realistic than most Gabonese elites. I spoke with the French ambassador about
                    it. I said, “You know enough about the United States to know that you can't get
                    the Americans to think even for even ten minutes about Africa for God's sake,
                    never mind about replacing the French in Gabon.” I think he himself understood
                    it, but it was in his political interest to keep the idea afloat; so we had to
                    deal with that reality.</p>
                <p>Another one of our objectives was to try to persuade the Gabonese to be more
                    environmentally sensitive. I made a personal trip to Lope, one of the major game
                    preserves in the center of the country. I met there by chance an English woman
                    zoologist and a French scientist who were studying primates. Gabon has probably
                    more primates and a more diverse primate population than anywhere in the world.
                    They had been studying primates for several years in this preserve. They were
                    very dedicated to their research, but were outraged that the ecosystem in the
                    preserve was being transformed by logging operations. They said, “Can you
                    believe they are logging this game preserve? They've allowed the French logging
                    companies to come in and take out the high value species.” Gabon is a major
                    exporter of tropical hardwoods and has been since colonial times. It exports not
                    just mahogany and mahogany veneers, but some of the most extraordinary tropical
                    hardwoods which are sold to Europe and the Far East to be used for furniture and
                    paneling. The loggers first send in trained locals to identify the high-value
                    trees. Then they plot them on a map and bulldoze roads that take them closest to
                    the identified trees. They fell the trees, drag them to the road and them truck
                    them to the rivers to float down to the ports. The logging of these trees
                    obviously changes the ecosystem for the primates. The idea that the Gabonese
                    would maintain a game preserve and try to promote themselves as being concerned
                    about the environment, and then to allow logging was clearly ridiculous. As I
                    promised the researchers, I spoke to the president about it. I explained my
                    experience and pointed out that logging game preserves undermines Gabon's
                    environmental credibility. He claimed to be surprised about the logging, saying
                    he had not been to that preserve himself in 20 years. He claimed that many of
                    these logging concessions dated from the pre-independence period. Obviously, as
                    chief of state he could demand a renegotiation of the terms if he chose to. I
                    continued to lay it on, pointing out Gabon's tremendous potential for
                    ecotourism. Gabon has extraordinary biodiversity and there for great potential
                    for tourism. He replied, “Well, I'll look into it.” Ironically, Gabon today
                    touts its ecotourism and biodiversity, and apparently now earning considerable
                    revenue from it.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>I don't know that anything ever came of my approach in this instance, but
                    recently Secretary Powell was in Gabon and he went to the Wonga-Wongue game
                    preserve just south of the capital to be shown the forest elephants. You have to
                    travel there by helicopter, and at dawn you can see the elusive rain forest
                    elephants. This particular visit is especially ironic because late in my tenure
                    I learned that a senior Gabonese police official had been going out with his
                    buddies and shooting forest elephants from helicopters. When it was brought to
                    my attention and I went to the president's son to complain about it. I said,
                    “You know if this incident gets out to the international community, Gabon is
                    going to become the laughing stock of the world in terms of its commitments to
                    environmental issues.” That activity at least did come to a halt. Unfortunately
                    when the Secretary went to Wonga-Wongue he didn't see the rain forest elephants
                    apparently they didn't get there just at dawn when they come out of the woods
                    but when the sun comes up they retreat back into the jungle.</p>
                <p>In any event, I did bring environmental issues to the president's attention, and
                    tried to persuade him of the tourism potential that exists. Like most African
                    leaders and I don't mean to denigrate him in particular, his sense of time
                    horizons and the vision was simply not there. Of course he was deeply engaged in
                    his effort to maintain control over the restive political environment. Tourism
                    revenues could serve to replace some of the revenue from its other resources.
                    While the manganese industry was going well, it was still not price competitive
                    with manganese from Russia. Uranium was under a cloud from the Chernobyl
                    incident, as a source for power generation. So, uranium operations were winding
                    down. The logging interests were increasingly subject to a range of restrictions
                    by environmentally concerned governments particularly in Western Europe So,
                    Gabon was looking for alternative revenue sources.</p>

                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: AIDS was an issue and, not surprisingly, it was not being handled very
                    well. It was not a terribly serious problem at that time, but knowing how
                    explosive the disease can be, more action was indicated. Knowing that one of
                    Kenneth Kaunda's sons had died of AIDS and another one was is HIV positive,
                    Africans were beginning to feel some discomfort. The elites are most susceptible
                    to AIDS as they are the most mobile segment of the population. AIDS is being
                    brought into the Gabon's cities because the elites had a insatiable taste for
                    “bush meat” which included monkeys. I remember one time biking around the city
                    and seeing four or five monkeys quite large monkeys laid out on the sidewalk for
                    sale. I tried to take a picture, but the vendors became very exercised. When you
                    drove into the countryside, there were all kinds of game for sale on the
                    roadside from crocodiles to small deer, and occasionally monkeys. Ideally,
                    buyers got there early enough before it got too ripe in the sun. An American
                    primate researcher told me that the Gabonese were shooting every animal within
                    20 miles of the roads, and poachers were then killing everything along the
                    rivers as well.. Having wiped out all the game it was becoming increasing
                    difficult to meet the demand in Libreville. Bush meat was selling for more than
                    air-freighted filet mignon in Libreville. Libreville was well known from having
                    some of Africa's most spectacular grocery stores where you could buy 500
                    different French cheeses and all kinds of cuts of meat. Nonetheless, the elites
                    preferred loved bush meat without regard of the price.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of finance, at the embassy were these high costs,
                        was this compensated for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, the cost of living allowance was quite good, all things
                    considered. It was pretty reflective of the real cost of living, but prices
                    would still stagger you. Apples were $3.00 a piece, a six-pack of Budweiser was
                    $20 or more, but remarkably it was available There was one store where an
                    enterprising north African had set up a store with almost exclusively American
                    goods brought in by containers. You could buy a jar of mayonnaise that would
                    cost $2.50 here, would cost you $9.00 there, but it was American. His clientele
                    was mostly Americans in the oil sector. Food grown on the economy was reasonably
                    priced, but it was very limited. Libreville was a very expensive place, and so
                    designated near the top of the list by the UN cost of living index. Going out to
                    dinner cost at least $80 a person at a decent restaurant. There were a lot of
                    very high quality restaurants. The 35,000 French residents were getting paid
                    very handsome salaries, and they could support a very substantial culinary
                    establishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>I remember one time the visiting Mobil Oil vice president had eight of us out to
                    dinner. The bill was over $2,000 The meal was excellent, I remember I had the
                    ostrich, and the chef was French, a graduate of the cordon blue. Most Embassy
                    people could only rarely go out to dinner. By contrast, the French were having a
                    high old time. When the lyce�s closed during the time of political confrontation
                    however, a lot of them took their children out of school so they not fall
                    behind. They anticipated that the lyce�s would have disruptions in the future
                    and so they could not take the chance. When the children returned to France,
                    many of the wives left as well. Their departure put a dent in the high end part
                    of the economy. During the rioting in late 1989 the world class cinema complex
                    in Libreville was torched by rioters because it belonged to the president's son.
                    Some of the glitter began to fade during the time I was, but it was still a
                    stimulating and challenging period even though the U.S. remained a distant
                    second to the French in the country.</p>

                    condescend to us. I'll tell you one other change that took place as well. My

                    last too long. In any event, he had been of the belief that the best and the
                    quickest way to find out what was going on in Gabon was to invite the French
                    conseilliers technique from the various ministries for lunch or dinner. When I
                    took over, the only Frenchmen who came to the ambassador's residence were the
                    French diplomats, the Ambassador and those with whom we worked. I did not invite
                    the conseillers technique, because I didn't think that was right approach. I
                    thought we were there to. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the French, these are the white?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: White advisors, yes, in each of the ministries. They did know a lot
                    about what was going on. They usually countersigned everything the minister did.
                    I believed that I should talk to the minister directly. I decided to play
                    according to the book, and not play this side game. Whether the French resented
                    this change I don't know, but they recognized the different approach. I figured
                    I was not accredited to the Gabonese government, not the French government.</p>

                <p>I should say a word about some of the prominent visitors Gabon hosted in the last
                    six months of my tour. The most bizarre was the visit of Michael Jackson, the
                    great Michael Jackson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's a rather oddball entertainer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: He's a very strange individual indeed. Apparently, he had been doing a
                    music video about Egypt in which he played a young pharaoh, when the idea of
                    visiting Africa seized him. Bongo's son Ali had had friends in the entertainment
                    industry in the United States, and he extended an invitation to Michael Jackson
                    to come to Gabon. So, Michael Jackson assembled a group of people, and they
                    worked up an itinerary to Africa. It was the most extraordinary visit that one
                    could ever possibly imagine. He arrived in his own chartered 737 aircraft.
                    Everybody on the plane was an African-American except for one English fellow who
                    was a holistic healer from the Caribbean. The party was accompanied Irv Hicks,
                    an old AF hand, as the State liaison person. I've known Irv for many years, and
                    he seemed bewildered as to purpose of the trip and his role. The visit began to
                    unravel from the moment Jackson's plane landed. First, there was an endless
                    delay for Jackson to deplane, and it seemed the president's entire family
                    including all their kids, were waiting in the VIP lounge. They hoped for a photo
                    opportunity with the great entertainer. He was apparently enthralled about
                    coming home to Africa and hesitated at leaving the aircraft. One of his security
                    men finally went up and assured him that everything was fine. The understanding
                    was that he would come down to the VIP lounge and spend a little time with the
                    president's family, schmooze and then leave in a limousine the president had
                    laid on for him. When he finally raced down the ramp, he looked like Mickey
                    Mouse. He had a red shirt and black pants and he wore white gloves. He had on a
                    wide brimmed hat with hair streaming out underneath so you could barely see his
                    face. He has an affectation of putting his hand to his face like this, which
                    came back to haunt him. As he brushed past, I tried to introduce him to the
                    president's daughter who was the foreign minister. He raced through the crowd
                    with fans screaming from the balconies of the main terminal, charged through the
                    VIP lounge with his bodyguards pushing people out of the way. By this time,
                    crowds of fans on the grounds around the airport and from the balconies above us
                    were erupting and screaming. It was like an explosion. He and his guards roared
                    to the limousine parked in front of the VIP lounge. He jumps into the limousine
                    by himself with a couple of his security people. The escort had no idea what's
                    going on. The motorcycle policemen were befuddled, but when Jackson stood up in
                    the sun roof and started to wave, the crowd surged forward screaming, they start
                    to form up. Jackson panics and ducked down and says let's get out of here. The
                    escort blasts through encircling crowd and disappears toward his hotel. I
                    apologized to the foreign minister, and said to his people that we have no role
                    to play in this visit, but we were prepared to assist his party.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>That afternoon there was an event at his hotel and the president's daughter was
                    also supposed to be there and kids from the president's family. My older boy was
                    on the stage with an international children's choir performing for Jackson. We
                    were sitting close to Jackson and we noted that he had one of those little boys,
                    13 or 14 years of age, with him whom he described to us as his nephew.. He
                    constantly had his arm around the boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Michael Jackson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: This was Michael Jackson and his young friend. It was later revealed
                    that he had these relationships with young boys, which landed him in deep
                    trouble. The people in Jackson's party were almost as bizarre as Michael
                    himself. They described him as a “gift from God” and they virtually worshipped
                    him. For his second day in country, Ali Bongo had arranged a trip to several
                    cities in the interior. I asked the PAO to accompany the party and offer to
                    interpret and to provide advice. She had the most extraordinary experience. They
                    were given an Air Gabon plane to take them up to Oyem in the north, and then
                    down to Franceville. In Oyem, the people thought Jackson would perform, but he
                    had no intention of performing. His trip was being videotaped to work into a
                    possible music video. In Oyem, when they found out he wasn't going to perform,
                    they went ballistic. They charged across the big public square and his people
                    panicked. Once again they hauled him away, and raced back to the airport where
                    the military could hold off the crowds back. He left immediately for
                    Franceville. This was considered to be Bongo's hometown, it had more amenities
                    than you could expect to find in the African bush. Air Gabon, which was run by
                    the French, told Ali Bongo that it had to have the plane back to fly regularly
                    scheduled flights that evening. The plane returned to Libreville and Jackson and
                    party are stranded. The people in Jackson's entourage went into panic mode. It
                    seems that Michael Jackson has to sleep every night in a special container to
                    preserve his complexion and his many plastic surgeries. The people around
                    Jackson were just unreal; it was like some sort of a cult. All efforts to obtain
                    a replacement aircraft failed. There is a luxury hotel in Franceville that is
                    seldom more than 10 percent full. Obviously he survived a night without his
                    container, but when he returned the next day there was a good deal of
                    unhappiness about that episode.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>On this, his last day in Gabon, there was to be a presidential presentation of a
                    medal, something like the Order of the African Elephant. I was asked to attend,
                    and while awaiting the festivities, I was in the waiting room when Michael
                    Jackson arrived. In lieu of the little boy, Michael Jackson entered with a baby
                    chimpanzee clinging to his midsection. The president's son introduced us and I
                    was amazed at how little presence this mega-star exhibited. His handshake was
                    limp and spoke in a mumble. The conversation turned to arranging to take the
                    chimp back to the U.S., and the president's son says, “I'm sure the American
                    Ambassador can make arrangements to help you to take this chimpanzee to the
                    United States.” I said, “It's not going to happen. They are an endangered
                    species and there are endless restrictions on importing chimps.” Even research
                    institutions take months and months to obtain permission. Ali Bongo replied,
                    “I'm sure you can overcome all that.” I offered no hope. Inevitably the chimp's
                    mother had been killed by poachers and it would cling to anyone. Someone took
                    the chimp from Michael before he was ushered into the president's office.
                    Jackson's PR people wanted to videotape the whole ceremony. I went in before him
                    and was part of the furniture. From there I could hear the exchange between the
                    President and his son. Of course Michael and his people didn't speak any French,
                    and had no idea what's being said. Bongo said to his son, “Now, tell me again,
                    who is this guy? Why am I giving him a medal? What has he done for Gabon?” Bongo
                    was completely bemused. .When Michael Jackson entered, the lights went on, and
                    pictures were taken, hands shaken and finally the pinning on of the medal.
                    Michael Jackson said a few whispered words.</p>
                <p>In any such event, after the presentation, the lights go down and the two
                    principals usually sit down and have an exchange of words. Michael had almost
                    nothing to say. The president thought, well, okay, I guess this is finished. He
                    essentially dismissed Michael Jackson, the lights go back on and Michael Jackson
                    leaves the president's office. His managers had set it up a photo op those who
                    had missed the chance previously. They went to one of Bongo's very opulent
                    receiving rooms on the ground floor as backdrop. All I want was for Jackson and
                    his people to leave; his flight was at 2:30. They asked me if I wouldn't like to
                    have my picture taken with Michael Jackson. I demurred, while for half an hour
                    they ran from one side of the room to the other taking photos with various
                    family members on a banquet with Jackson. Finally he and his party departed for
                    the airport and he was gone. I sent a telegram, advising the embassies on his
                    itinerary to be aware of this bizarre individual and his party of
                    sycophants.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>Overall, his visit to Gabon did not redound well for Ali Bongo and his father.
                    The opposition, who now had their own newspapers, asked, “Who is this guy
                    Michael Jackson? We thought he was a black American, but he doesn't look like
                    one.” Because he has a very pale complexion, they seized on that to criticize
                    the Bongos. They criticized Michael Jackson for not performing. Jackson's
                    affectation of keeping his hand in front of his face, which I assumed was a
                    symptom of shyness, was seized upon as a sign that he didn't like the smell of
                    Africa. This issue arose again when Jackson went on to the Cote d'Ivoire next.
                    The African press reamed him over the implication that he couldn't stand the
                    smell of Africa. It was unfair, but the trip proved to be a disaster and he
                    curtailed the rest of his trip. I think he went on to Tanzania, but then he
                    returned to the U.S. He was going to go onto Egypt but the trip just fell apart.
                    That was my brush with real fame as far as I'm concerned.</p>
                <p>I also met the Pope. He came to Sao Tome, a Catholic country, the last stop on a
                    three-nation African tour. Being simultaneously accredited to Sao Tome I was
                    invited to be present for the visit. It was my sense that he was a man of great
                    gentility and sincere humility. This was his last stop on his visit and he
                    appeared completely exhausted. I thought he was probably not going to survive
                    another six months. The Sao Tomeans did not seem particularly impressed by the
                    Pope's visit. No more than, 5,000 or 10,000 people turned out for the open air
                    service. For an island nation of 140,000 mostly catholic people, and no place is
                    more than 20 miles away, I was surprised by the light turnout. After the service
                    there was a reception in the presidential palace. We were asked to line up and
                    the Pope's assistants came along and gave the women rosaries and the men
                    commemorative medallion of his trip. As I moved through the line and I'm
                    watching how the Sao Tomeans were treating the Pope. They were just shaking his
                    hand, and I thought that as Catholics aren't they supposed to be more
                    deferential? When I came before the Pope, I figured I'm neither Catholic and nor
                    should I be deferential as I was the American president's representative? So, I
                    shook his hand and spoke in English. He was obviously tired, and, while he
                    speaks 36 languages, it took him a moment to recognize English. He said it was
                    nice to meet you, and I didn't figure I should burden him further so I just
                    moved on. He spent about eight hours in the country and then returned to Rome.
                    He is still the Pope today and I had figured he wouldn't make it to the end of
                    1992. So much for my prognostications.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>I was accredited to Sao Tome Principe, and I took that responsibility serious,
                    making 23 trips there during my tenure. When I first arrived the government in
                    power was Marxist oriented. I wouldn't call it Marxist-Leninist per se, but it
                    basically the successor leftist government that arose after independence from
                    the Portuguese in 1975; this was now 1989. The whole Marxist process was wearing
                    very thin. The country is a nation of about 140,000 people. They are people who
                    were brought by the Portuguese from other nearby regions of Africa. The islands
                    had first raised sugar, than coffee and then cocoa under a plantation system. In
                    1913 it was the largest cocoa-producing country in the world. At about this time
                    there was a report circulating in Europe that the plantation labor system by
                    which they imported laborers to work in the cocoa plantations was essentially a
                    form of slavery. The workers were brought to the islands under a contract labor
                    system, but none of them ever returned home. Most of them died on Sao Tome. Many
                    of them died within two years, and those who would live beyond that had their
                    contracts extended, probably involuntarily. This became a scandal because the
                    British candy maker Cadbury which was owned by Quakers was the major purchaser
                    of Sao Tome's cocoa. Quakers are longstanding opponents of slavery. The
                    Portuguese were forced to make major improvements in the treatment of their
                    workers and in opening the islands to modernization. Cocoa production declined
                    in competition with largest producers on the African mainland, but cocoa was
                    still the most important economic activity on the islands at the time of
                    independence. In 1913 Sao Tome had produced 35,000 tons a year, but by
                    independence it was down to 10,000 tons. Within five years, with production
                    under the control of state companies, it was down to 4,000 tons. These
                    plantations were no longer really economically viable activities. They were more
                    a form of extended welfare where it just happened that the product was cocoa.
                    Many workers were still working on the pre-independence Portuguese plantations
                    using the antiquated turn-of-the-century equipment and houses that were 150 to
                    200 years old.</p>
                <p>In any event, the people of Sao Tome are very gentile, and the elites were
                    reasonably well educated. Despite their socialist perspective, they remained
                    very much oriented toward Portugal, and, to a certain extent, toward Angola.
                    There are some inhabitants who are Cape Verdeans by origin, and they are very
                    capable people. Our interests there were very modest, primarily to promote the
                    democracy and to promote economic development, while discouraging closer
                    alliance with the Bloc nations. I suppose that the most significant event in our
                    bilateral relations arose when I was tasked to negotiate for a site for a VOA
                    relay facility, an alternative, ironically, for the facility we had been forced
                    to close in Liberia in 1990. The proposed new facility would require only six or
                    eight people and have a very low profile. The Sao Tomeans were more than happy
                    to have us come. On the larger stage, there was a sub rosa competition between
                    the Portuguese and the French; the latter were interested in extending and
                    expanding their influence in the country and the former wanted to maintain and
                    strengthen its political and commercial relations. The Portuguese welcomed our
                    involvement while the French harbored suspicions about our intentions.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>The Marxist government's mandate eventually ran out and the new elections brought
                    in a fellow named Trovoada who was viewed as a more liberal politician and not
                    wedded to the one party system. He held office most of the time I was there and
                    he was always interesting to talk to. He was considered particularly friendly to
                    the French, and the French became pretty cozy with him. He had spent his time in
                    exile during the Portuguese rule in France rather than in Portugal, while most
                    of the hard-line leftist had spent their time in Angola. Despite a promising
                    start, regrettably he has proved to be a person all too susceptible to bribery
                    and political machinations. He did not have a very successful tenure. We had a
                    very small military assistance program which provided several patrol crafts so
                    they could patrol their fishery zone. This program fizzled as they could not
                    provide the fuel and spares to keep the craft operational.</p>
                <p>Recently foreign oil companies have found very substantial amounts of oil
                    offshore in areas bordering the Nigerian economic zone. There is an inevitable
                    conflict about how these offshore tracts should be divided up. There is an
                    article in this week's New Yorker Magazine about Sao Tome, our new friend, as it
                    says. In fact, there are a modest number of Sao Tomeans are in the United
                    States. They are friendly and decent people, and deserve to be treated with
                    respect.</p>
                <p>At the time I presented my credentials and made my calls on the few resident
                    ambassadors, the government's Marxist orientation was apparent. I called on the
                    Soviet ambassador and the Chinese representative, but not the Cuban. The Chinese
                    had built a stadium and were involved in building low cost housing. The Soviets,
                    soon to be just Russians, were closing down, and elderly Soviet ambassador was
                    ill and seemed completely worn out. He wished the best for the Sao Tomeans, and
                    asked that the U.S. be generous to them. The Cubans were considered a sinister
                    presence, but they were doing a few modest development projects. The Europeans
                    had a presence there as well. I think the Portuguese had the only resident
                    ambassador, a very gracious, elegant and intelligent fellow who was always
                    available to meet with me. All other accredited nations were represented from
                    either Luanda or Libreville.</p>

                <p>It is a delightful little country with tremendous possibilities for tourism.
                    There was a project underway to develop a resort in the northern part of
                    Principe. The developer was a mysterious South African named Hellinger, who was
                    in the arms/diamonds/gold business in Angola. He had set up a base near the
                    airport in Sao Tome, and as such, was able to transport all kinds of
                    unidentified cargoes to the Marxist Angolan government, the MPLA, in return for
                    access to diamonds. He had his own compound with his own armed guards. He was
                    right out of a James Bond movie. He was persuaded that the Americans were intent
                    to do him in and my few meetings with him were always laced with recriminations.
                    Once he insisted on showing me one of his transport aircraft that had been
                    supplying the MPLA against UNITA. A rocket had hit the plane just below an
                    inboard engine. The hole where the rocket had impacted was evident, but it had
                    not exploded. This was particularly fortunate because he had several American
                    pilots working for him. He also hired American flight crews and mechanics who
                    flew in and out of Sao Tome. God knows what his real business was, but he was
                    believed to be moving Angolan diamonds to markets where few questions were
                    asked. If these diamonds were not fiscalized, after paying off the MPLA leaders,
                    he had plenty of money to pay off officials in Sao Tome. The new president said
                    to me that he really wondered what being transported on those planes and claimed
                    he would find out. In fact, it seems that he too made an accommodation with this
                    character, and their operations were never seriously impacted. Nonetheless, it
                    was an interesting place to visit and as I walked around the small capital, I
                    would wonder about the lives of those who lived in the brightly painted modest
                    little bungalows just up from the ocean front and what the future of this nation
                    was to be. There were times when there was little food to be had in the capital
                    as there was virtually nothing in the market. They'd run out of fuel and so the
                    fishermen couldn't go out to fish. It is possible that oil revenues will change
                    all that, but more likely it will ruin a country with great charm and
                    gentility</p>

                    Office of Performance Evaluation for two years and then from there I worked as
                    special projects for the Director General on issues of women's class action suit
                    and black officers' suits. I also initiated and effort to modernize the

                <p>Today is the 27th of October, 2002. Keith, when did you start this work?</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I came back in 1992 from Libreville. I must say I did get a very
                    attractive offer from the African Bureau to be its nominee as ambassador to
                    Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. I was mightily tempted by this offer. Personal
                    considerations always play a role in this process and at that particular point
                    my older boy was 12 years and he had spent more than half his life overseas, and
                    my younger boy was five and I thought it was time for them to come home. We'd
                    been overseas for six years in a row. I knew that my older boy would be
                    disadvantaged with his peers by not even being part of the American society even
                    for such simple things as knowing the professional sports teams from various
                    parts of the country. I felt that I really couldn't take this offer. As it
                    turned out, that was the right thing to have done. I end up in PER because, in
                    part, Ed Perkins had been the Director General and I had been interested in
                    bring one of his deputies. I had served with him in AF/W and in Liberia, and I
                    looked forward to the opportunity to serve in personnel again as I'd done in
                    CDA. Ed was favorably inclined to have me, but you may recall in the waning days
                    of the Bush administration, there was some concern about how Thomas Pickering
                    was handling the USUN port folio. It seems the White House wasn't very happy
                    with some of the things Pickering was saying as he seemed to demonstrate a
                    greater degree of depth and understanding than the administration itself did on
                    some of the key issues. The White House decided that he should be moved on. The
                    search for a replacement focused on Ed Perkins who could be relied on to follow
                    the White House's lead and his confirmation with the Senate would present no
                    problems. So, Ed was moved to the United Nations, which turned out to be a
                    somewhat unfortunate assignment for him. In any event his ability to influence
                    the events in PER obviously diminished, and I was told that the front office was
                    not in the cards. I asked about PER/CDA as I had worked as division chief in
                    that office 1981-83. I was told that this position was already assigned to
                    somebody else; that turned out to be Johnny Young. They proposed the Office of
                    Performance Evaluation. I didn't know much about it, but I knew it was not an
                    insignificant responsibility. PER claimed that it was trying to upgrade the
                    office director positions by assigning former ambassadors. So I took over PER/PE
                    and I found it was an interesting operation. We organized the annual selection
                    boards and tenuring boards. The office has a permanent staff of 23 people, most
                    of them civil servants. Some of the civil servants are deeply entrenched and
                    others come and go. They had the promotion cycle process down reasonably well,
                    and for those interested in how the Foreign Service promotion process works, I
                    can bear witness to the fact that it's about as good as it's likely to get. Now,
                    nothing is perfect, but in terms of how we constitute boards and how PER
                    negotiates the precepts with the AFSA, and then how the boards are trained and
                    how they review performance files, it is as best as can be done. A fair and
                    rigorous process, and those who participate as members of selection boards
                    emerge with a deeper appreciation of the effort to make this a fair process.
                    Nothing is flawless, but even so, we felt it was a very effective and
                    constructive system of reviewing Foreign Service files and giving people an
                    honest opportunity for promotion.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>The key problem was that getting good people to serve on these boards. It was an
                    annual exercise that began early in the calendar year. The Director General
                    would work from a list we would compile and write them a letter requesting that
                    they serve as chair or a member of that year's boards. The boards are
                    structured, as you probably know, so that the chair is from the cone of the
                    officers that is being reviewed. The other members are from the other cones.
                    There is always going to be a female on every board, a female professional
                    officer as available. There will always be a minority and a female on each
                    board, and an other agency member and a public member for a total of six people.
                    Persuading State officer to participate on boards entailed identifying officers
                    who haven't served on boards recently, who have a high standard of achievement
                    and integrity. Then the Director General sends a personal letter to request them
                    to serve on the boards. The first requests usually secure about 50% of the
                    officers required. For those that opt out their excuses include that it is
                    disruptive to their career or their onward assignment; it's disruptive to the
                    operation of the post overseas, and its disruptive to their family or other
                    personal considerations. The boards convene in the summer which makes it a
                    little bit easier for candidates, who are often transferring back to the
                    Department, and are thus more amenable to board service. Ideally, we to try to
                    get at least a 50% of the members who were either overseas or returning back
                    from overseas, because we believed that it was important to ensure that the
                    Foreign Service perspective was given its full weight.</p>
                <p>After the first 50% had declined to serve, PER/PE would have to identify
                    alternative candidates. We'd move through the lists of the available candidates
                    and it would often not be until just before the first boards convened in June to
                    get a full complement of board members. We had somewhat less difficulty with
                    other agency members. Public members were relatively easy to recruit because we
                    had sort of a reserve of candidates. Ideally the public member would have worked
                    with the Foreign Service in some capacity or had some overseas experience. The
                    idea of including both the other agency member and the public member was to keep
                    the Foreign Service people honest. Once the boards convened, we would train them
                    for 2-3 days. The cardinal rule was that they were not to evaluate the relative
                    merits of the officers being reviewed on anything other than what in the written
                    file. A board member may not say, I know that person and he was a loser. The
                    public and other agency members are asked to keep that in mind during board
                    deliberations. We encouraged them to be very rigorous on this point, and we felt
                    their presence would constrain the chair and this other Foreign Service members
                    from injecting their prejudice into the selection process. I felt the system as
                    constituted was very good, and I fought very hard to protect it.</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>The “mandatory” 5% low ranking requirement did not exist then, so the boards were
                    instructed only to “identify” 5% of those reviewed for low ranking. This
                    exercise was, in a way, artificial and not particularly productive, but the
                    regulations were clear. As the Department initiated its personnel restructuring
                    including offering buyout, there was pressure to get people out through the low
                    ranking process. In the early '90s, the number of officers selected out through
                    low-ranking jumped from about 20 to about 75. During my tenure officers were
                    low-ranked but not selected out, and then their names would come up for
                    reassignment in the next assignment cycle and Personnel would again have to find
                    a position where they could do the least harm.</p>
                <p>I would like to offer a bit of the context in PER in the early '90s. It was a
                    period when there was a significant effort to bring more women into leadership
                    and program direction roles. The Director General was Genta Hawkins Holmes who
                    had been ambassador to Namibia She was a bright and capable person and handled
                    herself well in public. In the past, however, Directors General had usually had
                    served at least two Ambassadorial assignments at significant overseas missions,
                    or as an assistant secretary and as a Chief of Mission. In any event, she
                    presided over a PER front office that was very much oriented toward a new
                    Foreign Service that was intent on dismantling what they saw as the “Old Boy
                    Network.” They openly ridiculed the white male officers and decried all the
                    problems that stemmed from this group having control of the system for so long.
                    Any one who objected to this new approach was termed a whiner, and their
                    concerns discounted. As a result, I found it a difficult environment in which to
                    garner front office support for initiatives that I tried to pursue or procedures
                    I was trying to protect. For example, we tried to maintain not only the
                    integrity of the promotion process, but also of the awards program for which PE
                    was responsible, as well. All too often, people were being given awards that
                    were no more than cosmetic baubles. I remember in particular that outgoing
                    Secretary Baker wanted to give his personal secretary the Distinguished Honor
                    Award. This award is probably the only remaining “honor” award that has any real
                    significance. It was awarded almost exclusively to senior Foreign Service career
                    professionals who have had substantial policy and resource responsibilities, and
                    who had handled them in an outstanding manner. This secretary was somebody
                    brought in from the private sector by Baker, and I am certain that she provided
                    yeoman service, but she was not the kind of recipient that was contemplated for
                    such an award. I made an issue of granting this award, and I suggested a
                    reasonable alternative award. PER took the issue to the Executive Secretary, and
                    whether he actually had the courage to raise it with Baker, I have no idea. In
                    any case, I could not persuade the Director General to stand up to the Secretary
                    on this, and his secretary received the distinguished honor award. I am certain
                    she did not understand the distinction from a distinguished service award. I
                    felt that that was the kind of thing I should stand up for, but the Director
                    General simply said we're not going to discuss this anymore. I also pleaded with
                    Genta to hang tough on permitting senior officers to opt out of serving on
                    selection boards, suggesting that the request to serve be signed by the
                    Secretary. Again, she demurred.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>The personnel function in the Department of State is probably the most sensitive
                    of all its various activities despite the higher profile of policy and
                    intelligence positions which require the highest-level clearances. Information
                    about assignments and promotion prospects are among the most closely held issues
                    among Foreign Service officers. There has always been the sense that those who
                    control Personnel can pretty much have their way on issues of importance to them
                    personally with minimal regard for the regulations. In most cases they're
                    correct. As a result, their preferences both in terms of personnel policies and
                    deciding the people that they want to see rewarded always seems to prevail. Only
                    the occasional intervention of a political appointee, such as the under
                    secretary for management, can disrupt what the DG wants to have happen. Of
                    course, if that undersecretary initiates action that contravenes regulation and
                    practice, the DG is the primary official who should stand up for respecting the
                    regulation. All too often, they are often unwilling to do so.</p>
                <p>With the end of the Bush administration in 1992, Dick Moose took over as the
                    under secretary of management. We thought there was a certain irony in that
                    appointment. He had been the assistant secretary for Africa in the Carter
                    administration having started out as the management undersecretary. As the story
                    goes, after three months in that position in 1977, he had not covered himself in
                    glory and they asked him what other job he would like to have in the department.
                    He ended up in AF where his performance during his tenure was mixed. With the
                    Warren Christopher crowd, Dick found himself again the under secretary for
                    management. It seemed a rather peculiar choice, to say the least. I know Dick,
                    and I think he's a very decent fellow, but I always felt that management was not
                    his strong suit. As I got involved increasingly in the systems side of
                    Personnel, he became more engaged in this issue on which he had not previously
                    focused.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>Let me just say a bit about information systems in the department because it was
                    an interesting and important part of what I tried to do in this assignment. When
                    I came back to the Department in 1992 I found on our desks the antiquated, what
                    they called the Wang classic, which is a monitor with a keyboard attached to it.
                    These were machines that we junked when I was in Liberia in 1987. We stacked
                    these machines up against the wall in GSO looking for some way to dispose of
                    them. It was finally decided to throw them into the waters off Monrovia. Here in
                    1992, the same were on our desks in the Department. I had served in CDA back in
                    the early '80s, and I was back almost ten years later dealing with the same
                    system, the same word processing that we'd had 10 years before. They had
                    computerized the assignment process to the extent that when you did an agenda
                    for an assignment panel meeting, you started the process by inputting it into
                    the computer. If the assignment was approved, as in most cases it was, it would
                    then move to the next station in PER and successive assignment actions would be
                    taken. We had proposed this in the early '80s, and it was now in effect. It was
                    a fairly simple mechanical process. Computers have a three-dimensional, even a
                    four dimensional capability and PER was still working in two dimensions. To give
                    you a specific example, during the transition between the Bush and Clinton
                    administration, there was an intense demand for personnel information. PER was
                    asked for all the assistant secretary and deputy assistant secretary positions
                    and equivalent in the Department of State; the position number and the
                    incumbent's name. PER's IM operation did a number of different attempts to
                    obtain this info. At the end of one week they came up with a list which I looked
                    at. I found that it was 50% wrong, that either they missed jobs altogether or
                    there were jobs that had been eliminated, or there were jobs that were no longer
                    being encumbered by the individuals that the data base showed. I remember a
                    deputy assistant secretary in particular who had worked in AF. He had been gone
                    for five years, and yet his name was still coming up in this position. So, they
                    were tasked to do it again on a priority basis. They came back three days later
                    and the list was still 30% wrong. The system couldn't equate such positions as a
                    deputy director in INR who has a DAS job and likewise it couldn't pick up a lot
                    of other critical information. That's because PER's system was what they call a
                    flat file, it was this two-dimensional. You put the information in it and it
                    could bring it back up, but it couldn't interconnect or integrate it. If you
                    wanted to find out how many FSO-2 political officers we had who had Chinese at
                    the 3/3 level and where they were and what there transfer eligibility dates,
                    TEDs, were, the system failed. They tried these kinds of operations and the
                    results were inevitably wrong because the information was being inputted
                    manually and there was a backlog, and the data that they retrieved was often
                    dated and inaccurate. Clearly, PER's system was inadequate.</p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>I took it upon myself, while I was running PER/PE, to do a study of the IM
                    systems in PER. I interviewed other IM savvy people in at least a dozen other
                    bureaus to find out what they were doing in the IM field. Not surprisingly, I
                    found that those who had independent funding or had overseas operations
                    missions, for example, the international narcotics office, has funding from
                    outside and they had really a quite superb IM system which linked to their
                    offices in posts in Latin America. EB had a pretty good system. My analysis of
                    the problem was the Department's Office of Information Management itself. First,
                    the managers and the personnel were, by training and experience, radio
                    operators, and communicators who were only belatedly learning to master
                    computers. With computers, all document creation, transmission, distribution and
                    storage would be integrated. The management was not prepared to approve new
                    systems until IM had established standards for operating systems and security.
                    Therefore, virtually everything beyond the Wang system, to include internet
                    access, was on hold. The Department was wedded to Wang which had been cutting
                    edge 10 years before, but had been pushed aside by PC based computing. PER's IM
                    people had not clue about this technology.</p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>Most of the people who ran our IM operation had started in the Department as mail
                    clerks. They had worked their way up to the PER message center and been
                    entrusted with managing the Wang system. I worked with these people, they're
                    very fine fellows, and they were doing the best they could, but they had no idea
                    what was out there. I would say to them, “Are you going to go to the annual
                    Federal systems Expo down at the Washington Convention Center?” They hadn't
                    heard of it. I said there were all kinds of government IT people are going to
                    these events that occurred every few months. I would go to these gatherings
                    myself bring them back brochures. In many cases, they were on the brink retiring
                    and there were really no IM savvy personnel ready to step in behind them.
                    Younger more junior employees were more knowledgeable of systems because they'd
                    been exposed to them in college and in their own lives. The PER system was a
                    rather hodge-podge operation. PER received little guidance from IM which was
                    under the direction of a senior Foreign Service admin officer who was usually
                    there for two years. Usually they didn't understand the IM function themselves.
                    They counted on their subordinates to know and these subordinates were primarily
                    communication people of broad experience, and some had mastered certain aspects
                    of systems. Clearly PER needed people who understood what was happening in the
                    systems sector and what needed to be done to improve the way personnel records
                    were managed. My first task was to convince PER that its system was antiquated
                    and that there were better ways to manage PER's information. The director of
                    administration in PER/EX was defensive. She didn't see any reason to “migrate”
                    to a new system and used the lack of resources to oppose change. She had little
                    familiarity with modern systems and she was not getting useful information from
                    those running PER's IM operations. I pointed out that a PC LAN, a local area
                    network, would permit our employees to multitask. In PE as in the rest of PER,
                    if you wanted to go from word-processing to the PER database, you had to log out
                    of the one and logon to the other, a procedure that could take 3-5 minutes With
                    a PC based LAN, you need only click from one window to another. PER/EX initial
                    reaction was I'm being critical of what they've had done this far and to some
                    extent I was, but this was not the point. My objective was to persuade them to
                    focus on what was possible as opposed to what had gone before. While initially
                    there was a fair amount of resistance, over time, they began gradually to see
                    some benefit to PER, and to themselves, in getting involved in this issue and
                    the prospect of obtaining more money from the Department to fund the
                    migration.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>I produced a 27-page study of all that I had learned with recommendations for
                    modest incremental improvements.. I analyzed 12 different bureaus' systems and
                    their varying degrees of success. Since IM hadn't established the standards, it
                    tried to prevent the bureaus from launching their own systems, but several other
                    these bureaus did create mini-systems with LANs just as posts overseas had done.
                    I had hear the story that former Vice President Mondale, Clinton's Ambassador to
                    Japan asked for an internet connection in his office and was told that IM had
                    not issued standards for internet connections. He replied, “I don't give a damn
                    about IM, I want internet access,” and of course, he got his connection.
                    Overseas posts set up their own LAN s and WANs, wide area networks tailored to
                    their own operations. In some case, the bureaus had hired consultants to assist
                    the Embassies' efforts. The bureaus in Washington were doing the same thing. For
                    example, EB needed a lot of economic data and they needed access to the
                    internet. IM was trying to prevent Internet access.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IM stood for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Information Management. The Bureau of Information Management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did that fit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Under A.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Right. For a while it was under DS but then the DS shed IM and it
                    became IRM . The Department was aware of its lack of information management
                    specialists. I remember in the early '80s when I was in CDA, the Department put
                    out a call for 200 IM technicians. They had little idea how to recruit such
                    specialists. They had to be cleared and they had to be worldwide available and
                    to have medical clearances as well. And we needed 200 people within six months.
                    Even after two years they didn't have the 200 specialists they needed. They were
                    also transitioning people from the communications field to computers. Some of
                    them picked it up on it reasonably well while others never mastered systems.</p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>If the Department was going to move to local area networks away from what they
                    called “legacy systems,” the big centralized mainframe computers, it would need
                    to integrate the LANs to the legacy system. The LANs would need access to the
                    personnel data base on the WANG system which had been in operation since the
                    late 70s. The Department had a longstanding relationship with WANG which was
                    losing its ability to compete with IBM and other major IM systems firms. The
                    leaders of our IM operations did not seem to realize this reality. In December
                    of 1992, I believe it was, the Department signed the last major contract with
                    WANG before it went into Chapter 11 in August 1993</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chapter 11 being apply for bankruptcy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Apply for bankruptcy protection, right. The U.S. air force and Philco
                    Ford had been with WANG for many years, but they turned to other IM technology.
                    The Department had actually put out for bids for a replacement system to WANG.
                    IBM said it would cost $25 million just to prepare a proposal to take over the
                    Department's IM operations, and it demurred. So, we were stuck with WANG and
                    WANG was stuck with us. When WANG went into Chapter 11; it phased out its legacy
                    systems, reverting to the imaging business where its systems were state of the
                    art. We had to use the Wang system until a replacement could be determined. I
                    remember that one provision of the Wang contract was a maintenance charge of one
                    dollar per day for every Wang terminal in Main State. Wang had Having been
                    burned with our Wang contract, there was great hesitation in the Department to
                    take responsibility for a replacement system. Further State had a reputation in
                    OMB of not using its IM resources wisely, and it as resistant to supporting our
                    request for funding a new system. So the way around the immediate problem was to
                    create LANs. and make them compatible to the Wang and you're in business with an
                    operational system that can do multitasking. You could move back and forth
                    between the main frame and the LAN which would share information among your own
                    people. All this seemed an absolute mystery to these people who couldn't
                    conceive of what could be done with such a setup. I identified four applications
                    that we could use to improve efficiency just in my office alone if we had a LAN.
                    These included tracking receipt of EERs, monitoring the awards program and
                    scanning the database to avoid missing files of those eligible for the annual
                    review for promotion, a chronic problem. If somebody finds out that they were
                    not reviewed for promotion in a given year, they have an automatic grievance and
                    will receive a review by a reconstituted board which is both expensive and time
                    consuming. These boards give the member a much greater chance for promotion, as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about efficiency reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, the official personnel folder, or OPF, which is the file of all
                    the operational information about an individual's performance. The OPF is
                    divided with the right hand side a compilation of all one's EERs, and on the
                    left-hand side letters of accommodation, awards and training reports. Another
                    problem was the personnel audit report or PAR, a sanitized version of which was
                    provided for each member being reviewed. It was sanitized to take out such
                    things as date of birth and education so that the member's college would not
                    arouse any biases in board members. The remaining record of assignments, awards,
                    promotions, had to be up to date and accurate; if they were not, the member had
                    the basis for a grievance as well. PER's IM office had to accurately update the
                    PAR to make certain that the process would be as fair as possible.</p>
                <p>I recommended to the DG that these were some of the things we could do by
                    modernizing our systems. I insisted that one of the most important and cost
                    effective things we could do was to computerize EERs. Raters and reviewers would
                    type them right into an electronic form. They would then move forward just like
                    the assignment documents did, move from the rater to the reviewer, then to the
                    rated officer and to the post review panel. Most importantly, once the EER has
                    been prepared and reviewed it can be transmitted electronically to the
                    Department. To do so, the test is extracted from the form and is sent as an
                    attachment to an email to PE. PE then downloads the text into the template of
                    the EER form and it is available to print out and to archive in electronic form.
                    In order to be as fair as possible, a selection board can request, in case of a
                    close call on ranking members above or below the line for promotion, to view a
                    cross-section of the rater's EERs on other members. This could give the board a
                    sense if a rater has been too harsh on the individual member. As a result PER/PE
                    maintained 35,000 hard-copy EERs on file, or five years worth of EERs maintained
                    in a massive rotating file in the file room. That is an obvious application for
                    computers. Past EERs could be scanned into the computers, and with new EERs
                    transmitted electronically, in five the 35,000 EERs would all be stored
                    electronically.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>We found that raters and reviewers at posts overseas were chronically late in
                    getting EERs into PE. Theoretically, there is accountability for late EERs, with
                    attendant penalties. So, posts would send their EERs by Federal Express or by
                    DHL at an inordinate cost to the U.S. government, probably on the order of
                    $100,000 a year just to avoid the penalties that would accrue if the EERs
                    arrived late. I pointed out that if we prepared EERs electronically there would
                    be a whole range of benefits. Not only could we get rid of the 35,000 EERs, we
                    could create a matrix that would scan the EERs as they arrived searching for
                    inadmissible comments and terms. At that time, to be candid about it, we could
                    not review the over 7,000 EERs PE received every year. Inadmissible comments
                    were only caught if a board member challenged the EER content PE does not have
                    enough people, 23 people, to read 7,000 EERs to ensure they conformed to the
                    admissibility rules. I eventually persuaded PER that there was merit in
                    preparing electronic EERs and we finally engaged a contractor to design the
                    required programming. Shortly after I retired, PER did apparently run a pilot
                    test of electronic EERs with two different posts. The Service resisted, saying
                    it was too difficult. They claimed there was a chance of losing the data and
                    there were security concerns so EERs were encrypted and double encrypted as they
                    were sent out by the Department's own e-mail system. All of this was easily
                    overcome, but there is always resistance to change. This entire exercise seems
                    rudimentary today with our total dependence on computers and our addiction to
                    email. To my knowledge, as of this time, EERs are now being scanned into the
                    system. There was an exercise two or three years ago where they were actually
                    conducting selection boards using EERs read from a monitor, which I believe
                    would be a horrible exercise. While there are certain efficiencies, reading
                    massive amounts of text from a monitor is brutal. Yet boards could make its rank
                    ordering, highlight the most compelling parts of the EERs and. at the end of the
                    process, destroy all documentation of its deliberations.</p>
                <p>This exercise resulted from the PER bureau realizing that, once you have
                    electronic EERs it could save even more money by having selection boards
                    comprised of people located all over the world and the board would deliberate by
                    teleconferencing. They would all have the same electronic data input and then
                    they could discuss candidates and make determinations. I thought was a terrible
                    idea because you lose all the collegial ambiance..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've both obviously served on these. I mean you lose the
                        teamwork aspect. Because pretty soon you're all functioning on the same
                        wavelength which is done by being in the room together.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely. That old dynamic would be lost in this process. In any
                    event, the first step was to get the EER into an electronic form. Once drafters
                    get into that habit of preparing electronic EERs, PER benefits from a range of
                    new capabilities. Once it was determined how to double encrypt the EER emails,
                    AFSA was onboard. The Department IM's inability of to set the standards
                    necessary to use the Internet reached the point of absurdity. The bureaus simply
                    wouldn't tolerate it. For example, because Internet information is so important,
                    EB was one of the leaders in that area. EB needed up-to-the-minute statistics
                    and data, and access to business news on the Net.</p>
                <p>IM was wringing its hands about the security aspects, but this was inane. This
                    was now 1993 and no access to the Internet? Of course IM had to build firewalls.
                    Other Federal departments and agencies figured out how to do that. One of our
                    objectives was to establish an integrated personnel database, which is to say a
                    three dimensional database that you could query anyway you wanted, whether by
                    TED or grade or language ability or marital status, or combine any of those
                    elements and retrieve results instantaneously. That was basically what was
                    needed. I was finally able to persuade Under Secretary Dick Moose that we ought
                    to work for this objective. He quickly understood the merit in it. After I made
                    an informal presentation on PER's systems, he asked me to go to coffee with him.
                    He asked, “What do you think is the biggest problem in the way that our systems
                    operate?” I said, “We don't know who we have and where they are currently
                    posted. We do not have that information available at our fingertips. Given the
                    way things change in this world, we will need to know where people are assigned
                    and who has the expertise the Department needs. That's where the integrated
                    database comes in.”</p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>After that, I made a presentation using PowerPoint, one of the suite of programs
                    in Microsoft Office. I did a presentation about the problems we had in trying to
                    obtain basic personnel information. At the end of the presentation I produced a
                    cutesy little graphic to get the audience's attention. I took a moose head
                    graphic and I figured out how to get the moose to wink at the end of
                    presentation. That little trick may have had more impact than the content of the
                    presentation. I thought, if you're going to do a presentation about systems, you
                    should do it with the state-of-the-art presentation program. In 1993, this was
                    wow stuff; today its old hat. The IM people were familiar with such
                    presentations, but the decision-makers were basically completely naive about
                    systems. Eventually, after endless birthing pangs, PER did develop an integrated
                    database. Originally, it was to be a three-year $39 million program to create
                    this database and three other programs. One of which was to computerize the
                    awards program to ensure accurate information on awards is inserted into the
                    individual's the personnel audit report. I did have some impact on shaping PER's
                    systems development, although I couldn't swear to you today that we have a fully
                    functioning integrated personnel database. I know that they have a vastly better
                    database than they had before. Running parallel to PER's efforts was IM's effort
                    to create an integrated financial management program, which had been started
                    during the tenure of the previous under secretary for management. The Under
                    Secretary had a relationship with that company which caused some consternation
                    because of the apparent conflict of interest. As I understand it, by 1995 IM and
                    financial management just threw up their hands and agreed it wasn't working. It
                    proved to be a good deal more complicated than they thought. I don't know what
                    system the Department uses now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in personnel in the late '60s and actually we had a
                        system that worked not too badly called the royal McBee system in which we
                        used a knitting needle and hole punchers and cards. We could come up with
                        FSO-2s who spoke Chinese.</hi>

                <p>WAUCHOPE: Well, the key problem was that the assignment data was not being put
                    into the database in a timely way. The fact that some of these DASs had departed
                    five years before when PER did this DAS equivalent exercise, made my point that
                    the database was woefully inadequate.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me something about awards. I spent 30 years in the
                        Service and I got out in 1985. I don't think I got an award. Most of the
                        people I knew never got awards. Now I look at the biographic register and
                        everybody seems to be getting awards. I mean, was there a conscious decision
                        at some point to say, gee, let's get out and give awards or this just a
                        better breed of people than the ones I was with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: No. The award program was in transition while I was in PER/PE. We
                    didn't have any role in awarding them; we just processed and recorded them. I
                    think it was in the late '70s when the Department apparently decided to use the
                    awards as an incentive for improved performance. I'm talking primarily of the
                    meritorious honor award, the superior honor award and, of course, the
                    distinguished honor award, which was given to only a handful of senior officers,
                    usually at or just before retirement. The women's class suit in which I became
                    involved in 1994, mandated that female officers should be granted meritorious
                    and superior honor awards. The suit claimed that women were not granted these
                    awards in the same proportions as men. As a result, participants in the suit
                    could nominate themselves for one or more awards citing their service and
                    supporting it with a favorable EER. I have no idea how that worked out, but I
                    was bemused at the whole exercise.</p>
                <p>In the past, it was generally accepted that one ought not to receive the superior
                    honor award unless one was serving overseas, and that there ought to be a
                    dimension risk or exceptional hard work. As DCM, I chaired the Mission Awards
                    Committee in Mali. AID people were being nominated for superior honor awards
                    when all that they had done was their job. When asked why the nominees deserved
                    a superior honor award, the USAID rep would say, because of the difficult
                    conditions in which they operate and it's tough to get the host government to
                    cooperate. That's what its like for everybody working overseas. AID's philosophy
                    was that awards were a compensation for service in hardship posts, thereby
                    rendering the awards virtually valueless. When I was assigned to PE it appeared
                    that State had adopted the same approach; awards for service in busy offices.
                    The concept had been that meritorious honor awards were appropriate for people
                    who did an extraordinarily job domestically and the domestic assignment in a
                    town crisis backstopping or what have you, and superior honor awards should be
                    directed to people overseas who have found themselves in stressful, hostile or
                    dangerous environments who are doing an extraordinary job as well. That standard
                    had broken down. The result was a precipitous decline in the value of awards,
                    and most importantly, where does the rubber meet the road; in impact of awards
                    in the performance folder. The selection boards barely bothered to look at all
                    at the left hand side of the performance folder where awards are inserted as it
                    became a common conception that awards were contrived if not solicited by the
                    recipient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it would tell all of what was happening in
                        academia where people graduating with honors. I know at my little college I
                        graduated with honors and I think maybe 20% of us did. Now, there's
                        something like 70% or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Absolutely, grades at the undergraduate, and at graduate level as well,
                    have become ridiculously inflated. Everybody gets A's and B's. Where's the
                    average then? The C was supposed to be average. You ask yourself, what has
                    changed? What changed was the Department has become less focused on its
                    personnel and more directed by management for its exclusive benefit. To get the
                    recognition you want, you had to grasp for everything you could exploit to
                    enhance your record. The AF bureau, as I mentioned before, is, or was, a bureau
                    that really cared about those who served in the bureau. It recognized them for
                    their efforts and their willingness to adapt to very difficult conditions, and
                    AF looked out for its own. In other bureaus that interest and concern had begun
                    to break down. To get recognition beyond that bureau that knows you, you had to
                    have some other achievement that you could point to. So, awards apparently
                    became more sought after. When I was head of PER/PE I used to brief the incoming
                    A-100 classes on performance evaluation. I did this for five or six classes
                    every year. I made a point of giving them an unvarnished assessment how the
                    process worked. I would tell the JOs about performance evaluation, the
                    procedures and the realities. I would provide them explicit guidance about what
                    to do and what not to do on their own performance evaluations, which I believe
                    is critically important. I told them that they had to pay close attention to
                    from the beginning; how the EER was written, whether it was fair, whether it was
                    accurate, whether it reflected everything they had achieved. The bottom line is
                    that today more than has been the case in the last 20 years, you've got to look
                    after your own career interests; you cannot expect the system to look after you
                    or your career. The position of career development officer, who is the officers'
                    advocate, has survive through several restructurings of PER, but individual
                    officer has the primary responsibility to look after their own career. They
                    should check their performance folder at least every two years, and make sure
                    everything is in there that ought to be in there. You have to negotiate your EER
                    with your rater and your reviewer. If you're unhappy, or if you think it's
                    unfair, you should make clear why you think so. You should write it down and you
                    should convey it to them verbally and in writing. It's all a part of the new
                    process. The Department is a complex yet amorphous, detached operation, and you
                    simply have to know your rights and make sure that you pursue them vigorously.
                    There is no longer any stigma in doing so. I didn't pull any punches because I
                    thought we should give our people the right start.</p>
                <p>That's an interesting way to lead in to the suits that I got involved in after I
                    concluded my two years in PER/PE in 1994. In light of my personal situation I
                    was placed on PER over-compliment. My wife was diagnosed with a rare form of
                    cancer in February of 1993. It was a malignant cancer which oncologists have
                    great difficulty treating, but we were initially assured when surgeons removed
                    the cancerous tumor, that there was no sign of metastases. In point of fact, the
                    cancer apparently spread by the blood to her liver. While they said they had a
                    50% success rate treating it with chemotherapy, that did not prove to be the
                    case in my wife's situation. She had five chemotherapy treatments over five
                    months, and it did not have any significant effect on the tumor. She was granted
                    medical retirement in July 1994. As a result, I opted to remain in the
                    Department to be close to my family.</p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>I was assigned to work in an office in PER that had been set up specifically to
                    deal with two major class action suits that the Department had been contending
                    with for some years. The women's class action suit had been brought by Alison
                    Palmer in the early '70s. The participants were claiming institutional
                    discrimination against women. The other was the black officer suit in which
                    there were 17 named claimants, and was granted class action status, and the
                    entire black officer corps in the Foreign Service was included. The judge
                    presiding ruled that, if the black officers were claiming systemic
                    discrimination, everybody had to be included. I think at the outset you could
                    opt out, but if you didn't elect yourself out, you would be considered to have
                    been included. These suits were pursued by the plaintiffs primarily on the basis
                    of statistics demonstrating unequal treatment. They made a claim that women were
                    not being promoted at the same rate as white males, in particular. They were not
                    being given awards at the rate as white males, that they weren't getting
                    tenured, they weren't being passed on the entrance exams, and they weren't being
                    promoted by the selection boards. In both suits, it was claimed that statistics
                    proved that in virtually every personnel action there was discrimination. I
                    thought, if women don't pass the Foreign Service exam at the same rate as men,
                    shouldn't we look into why more women don't come forward to compete for the
                    Foreign Service. I was told this was irrelevant. The Department of State was
                    being defended in these cases by the Department of Justice. Their lawyers, who I
                    thought were distinguished by their arrogance and notable ignorance of how the
                    Foreign Service operated, would come to the Department for meetings once a month
                    on the status of the process. Less frequently, we would meet with the parties
                    representing the plaintiffs. It seemed to me our role was to concede everything
                    the plaintiffs claimed, and then they would go to the court and demand
                    corrective actions like the granting superior and meritorious honor awards to
                    all who applied. My sense was that, while this case was being pursued on a
                    statistical basis, some of the complaints were also based on the anecdotal
                    evidence, if not an urban legend as they call it today. For example, they
                    claimed that white males were disproportionately soliciting their supervisors
                    for meritorious and superior honor awards, and because women had not done so,
                    they had been discriminated against as shown by the statistics. My personal
                    experience throughout my entire Foreign Service career was I never solicited an
                    award, and I never had anybody solicit an award from me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never heard of anybody doing that.</hi>

                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, that was a part of the alleged evidence on which this claim was
                    based. The plaintiffs' attorneys put that case forward. I mentioned the
                    environment in the DG's office, and this tangible anti-male bias fed their sense
                    was that this claim was probably true. When I would interject my experience on
                    these issues, I was roundly dismissed. That was the prevailing atmosphere. So,
                    the corrective action was that any woman plaintiffs who felt that she should
                    have been granted a superior honor award could nominate herself for an award or
                    for multiple awards, if they thought they were warranted. The awards were
                    granted with minimal review. The Foreign Service culture reacted quickly by
                    determining that the honor awards no longer had any real value. Anyway, that was
                    one of the objectives that the suit had achieved. They claimed further that
                    women were being discriminated against in the examination process itself. The
                    attorneys demanded that women who had received a close to passing score on the
                    entrance exam over the last 12 or 15 years be encouraged to come forward to see
                    if they wanted placement in an A-100 class today. I don't know that anybody
                    really came forward to take advantage of this offer.</p>
                <p>My personal feeling about the experience of women officers in the Foreign Service
                    is that there were not enough in the service. We did not make a concerted effort
                    to recruit women in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Some male supervisors had not
                    employed these officers effectively either through either stupidity or
                    prejudice. My wife was an FSO who came in through the exam process just as I
                    had. She always performed at the highest level of dedication and competence.
                    Most female officers who I worked for, or who worked for me, were of a similar
                    high caliber and made significant contributions. I always believed that the
                    Department could ill afford not to capitalize on their skills and dedication and
                    to assign them to positions that would take fullest advantage of their
                    abilities. I was the joint recipient of the Equal Employment Opportunity Award
                    by the Department in 1983 for my efforts to assign women officers to supervisory
                    positions in AF during my tenure in PER/CDA. I thought my credentials were
                    pretty respectable on the issue of women in the service, but my perspective and
                    experience were dismissed by the DG and her subordinates at this time because I
                    was a white male and therefore guilty by that alone. Remarkably, Genta and her
                    subordinates never saw the irony that the situation they created was the obverse
                    of that which the Palmer suit protested. Plus ca change!</p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>One of the corrective actions arising from both the black officers suit and the
                    women's suit concerned revamping EEO training for managers, which I had taken
                    some years before. The course lasted only half a day and while it addressed how
                    words and actions can be interpreted in different ways be different groups, it
                    was too superficial. As these suits moved forward, it was agreed that this
                    training had to be pursued much more rigorously than in the past. I believe the
                    course is now three days long. Everyone who supervises anyone must now take the
                    course. The plaintiffs wanted every Foreign Service supervisor to take the
                    course within two years. We were able to demonstrate that that wasn't possible
                    logistically. You couldn't possibly cycle through that many people in that short
                    a period of time. Inevitably, the plaintiffs' attorneys said PER was dragging
                    its feet. It was unfortunate for the Department that the presiding judge in the
                    women's case was judge Stanley Sporkin. Sporkin had been the general counsel of
                    the SEC with Bill Casey, and when Bill Casey took over the CIA, Sporkin became
                    the general counsel at the CIA. I mentioned that when I was in West African
                    affairs in the Reagan administration, some of the wild ideas that came out of
                    the agency in that time. That was Casey's CIA, and the Department of State would
                    often quash these initiatives. It was up to Sporkin as general counsel to
                    promote and defend these initiatives that Casey and his people proposed. As a
                    result, he apparently harbored a very intense resentment against the career
                    Foreign Service. The women plaintiffs couldn't have found a more sympathetic ear
                    than Sporkin. It seemed as if everything that the Department put forward, or the
                    Department of Justice on its behalf, was slapped down. We were told to go back
                    and try again to do more for the women, and so we did. Among other corrective
                    actions were retroactive promotions. They had been in grade at the FS-3 level
                    for 20 years and they claimed that because of discrimination, they were entitled
                    to one promotion, probably two promotions. I know women who went from FS-3s to
                    FS-1s overnight. There were people that I had worked with, and I knew that they
                    did not have the ability to handle the responsibilities of an FS-1 officer; but
                    the deal was done and that was that.</p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>As we were dealt with the diverse issues the plaintiffs brought forward, the
                    Department it was in a retrograde retreat. The plaintiffs' attorneys would come
                    up with a new set of statistics allegedly showing that women were not being
                    assigned to positions of responsibility to the same degree as men. We responded
                    that they had defined what countries are more competitive for promotion or are
                    nicer places to serve, but the real issue is who bids on those positions. We
                    have to look at the bidding statistics, as well as the assignment statistics.
                    That was a basic point that the women attorneys weren't acknowledging, you can't
                    base claims solely on statistics that appear to show discrimination without
                    looking at the other factors that underlie these statistics. We had very limited
                    success with this approach, largely because the DG's reps did not press this
                    approach. Basically the women got pretty much what they wanted through court
                    directed settlements. When the Alison Palmer case was first filed, and was
                    finally made a class action suit, it had has to meet certain specific legal
                    requirements in the courts to obtain the judge's determination. All the women in
                    the Foreign Service were asked if they wanted to be participants in the suit and
                    a certain significant number said no. My wife was one among those who did not. A
                    number of her friends and colleagues did as well. It is obviously a subjective
                    judgment to say whether the more competitive officers opted out and the less
                    competitive stayed in. I don't know. The ones who did stay in, did derive
                    significant benefits from the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you running across the problem of reverse
                        discrimination? I mean I had one man who said he, he launched a suit. He was
                        nominated, he was accepted to be DCM I think it was in Finland, but the
                        ambassador in Finland I think it was Jim Kelly, was saying, well, he really
                        wanted a woman. So all of a sudden somebody who was several grades lower,
                        but a female was brought in his path. I think he said there was
                        documentation on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: There were several cases of that sort. There have been both grievances
                    and court cases, but they really went nowhere. When I was in PE, grievants would
                    claim that selection boards were discriminating against males. The fact is they
                    were missing the point. When we trained the selection board members, a process
                    that lasted three full days for each board, one of the presentations was by the
                    EEO office. At one of these sessions the acting head of EEO at that time said,
                    among other legitimate points, “When in doubt, promote the minority or the
                    female.” After he concluded, I said, as Office Director, that the EEO rep was
                    not correct. The position of the Department of State was that there was to be no
                    discrimination on the basis of race or gender. Boards were to recommend
                    employees based on the written record alone. While female employees can be
                    distinguished in the record, one's race cannot, and any reference to race is
                    prohibited. By agreement with AFSA, selection boards are to be a completely
                    color blind exercise. It was a struggle to eliminate these factors, but we tried
                    assiduously to do so. Another example of the environment that Genta presided
                    over in the PER front office, when she briefed boards at their swearing-in, she
                    would say to them, “I hope to see a substantial number of women among those who
                    are promoted.” Apparently she could not grasp that this was inappropriate.</p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>I knew an individual who became quite prominent in pursuing a reverse
                    discrimination grievance. He claimed that the selection boards are discriminated
                    against males, and that women were disproportionately being promoted, and,
                    statistically, that could, in fact, be proven. That allegation had also been a
                    part of the women's class action suit in the past. I said that, while the
                    statistics may or may not prove that case, I consider that gender bias by our
                    selection boards was unlikely. We tried to manage as color-blind and as fair a
                    system as we could. I suggested that he look instead at assignments. That's the
                    real key to advancement in the Foreign Service. Performing well in a
                    high-profile management assignment is what gets one promoted. He then began to
                    look at that aspect, as did others. One could ask, how is it that when 25% of
                    FS-01s were females, yet the number of female DCM at that grade was over 50%.
                    Clearly, one's chances of promotion are advanced by taking those positions. He
                    and others began to focus on that issue, but the assignment process is one of
                    those amorphous exercises in which there are multiple assignment criteria, and
                    you are at a loss to determine the deciding factors were in an assignment
                    decision. They were unable to prove that the Department had made a deliberate
                    effort to assign more minorities and females to these career-enhancing jobs.</p>
                <p>In terms of whether promotions are skewed by race or gender bias, you need only
                    look at the promotion lists of today; particularly at the most senior levels. At
                    those most senior levels, minorities and females have been promoted at
                    extraordinarily higher rate on a proportionate basis than any other group. Are
                    we making up for the past mistakes? Let's be honest about it. I joined the
                    Service in '66. During my A-100 course, I was part of a working group, which had
                    a project to determine how many black officers there were in the Foreign Service
                    of about 3,600 FSOs, and what was being done to recruit more. The answer we
                    received initially was 56. When we examined more carefully at that number, we
                    found that there were actually only 11 black FSOs, the others were reserve
                    officers who PER was counting to try to make the overall figure look better. The
                    service missed the boat back in the '60s and 70s with both minorities and women,
                    and it all came home to roost ultimately. When does this process stop, and we
                    achieve a completely merit-based system? That I don't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>Let me go back to the black officer's suit. They based their suit on a
                    statistical demonstration that black officers were not tenured at the same rate
                    as white officers on a proportionate basis, they were not promoted at the same
                    rate as the officers in all the grades in the Foreign Service, they were not
                    promoted into the Senior Foreign Service at the same levels. They tried to
                    pursue on the assignments side as well, saying blacks were disproportionately
                    being sent to Africa, and they said they could support that statistically as
                    well. This claim did not succeed because the element of self-selection inherent
                    in Open Assignments undermined their contention. The Department, again defended
                    by the Department of Justice, attempted to demonstrate that their claims were
                    incorrect, but we were hanged by our own statistics. My analysis of it is that
                    the Department's efforts in the past to recruit and advance blacks by making
                    concessions for them. Obviously you can more readily manipulate the outcome of
                    the oral examination process than you can a written examination. There were also
                    a couple of initiatives on the written examination in which minorities were
                    given a break. If they didn't quite meet the passing grade they were given an
                    opportunity to compete on the oral assessment.</p>
                <p>In the oral assessment there was an inclination to accept minorities into the
                    Service. By doing so, in an otherwise in a color-blind system, it essentially
                    lowered the barrier at the entry level, but did not extend this approach to the
                    other hurtles for advancement that exist throughout the career. If you do not
                    institutionally ensure that all the other hurtles are equally adjusted, you will
                    have a systemic problem. Since any reference to one's race is forbidden in the
                    promotion process. Even if a board knew that an officer is black or African
                    American, he cannot say so as that would not be an acceptable statement to make
                    in any verbal exchange in the selection board deliberations. Nonetheless, blacks
                    felt that they were not being tenured at the same rate as others; likewise for
                    promotions, assignments and awards. They could show that statistically. Remember
                    the mid-career program of the early 80s? We brought in experienced minorities
                    and females in at mid-career levels. It seemed like a valid concept. Those who
                    qualified had advanced university degrees, and in most instances, a fair amount
                    of practical experience. Most were FS-03 and 02s, and in a few cases as 01s. The
                    Department hoped for a quick fix, if you will, to increase the percentage of
                    minorities and women at the mid-levels. Many of these mid-level entrants
                    encountered problems because they hadn't been junior officers and they didn't
                    have the basic experience that a junior officer gains from their first few
                    tours. When they stumbled as well, they became part of this suit.</p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>The court found in favor of the black officers against the Department and the
                    settlement of $6.2 million was granted to them and their attorneys. Their
                    attorneys had started out pro bono, but decided after a while there was so much
                    work involved that they would have to have their share. I think the officers
                    themselves received something on the order of $4.8 million. The next issue was
                    how the plaintiffs were going to divide it up between the named claimants and
                    the other members of the class who, unless they opted out, were part of the
                    suit. Ironically, the plaintiffs came back to the Department and said, “This
                    settlement is all well and good, but we need your help in deciding how this
                    money should be distributed.” Well, the Department may have been foolish in
                    times past, but it wasn't foolish enough to become involved in that issue. Any
                    determination the Department made would subject it once again to litigation. It
                    demurred, and I have no idea how the money was divided.</p>
                <p>The true irony in this suit is that the plaintiffs claimed that the Department
                    had set them up for failure, by which I took them to mean that it had failed to
                    give the black officers an equal opportunity to advance through counseling,
                    mentoring and coaching them over the hurtles. In fact, the Department instituted
                    a system that gave these officers an advantage to get into the service, and left
                    them to fend for themselves vaulting the other career hurtles, thereby setting
                    them up for failure just as they had been claimed.</p>
                <p>Opportunities to hire and advance these plaintiffs were missed early in the 60s
                    and 70s, and having missed those opportunities, the Department could be faulted
                    statistically by both blacks and females, and it was. These suits have
                    significantly changed the structure of the Foreign Service. It is much more
                    broad-based and representative than it was before. Only time will tell about the
                    quality of the personnel and success of this effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Hispanics or Asians come up in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Not as part of these suits, but the Hispanics have their own
                    organization, and they were looking for opportunities to differentiate their
                    success rates from that of the non-Hispanic white males. They had a fair amount
                    of success in ensuring that Hispanics were represented on boards, and in
                    management positions, but not to the extent that black and females had. I don't
                    know if Asians were ever an issue per se. I believe they also have a group as
                    well, but my impression is that they have done quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I've noticed in the Foreign Service and
                        that has been in some of the jobs such as Director General or in some of the
                        other jobs which are not sort of geographic that a number of women who have
                        come in who've really held very minor ambassadorships. Mostly African and
                        mostly the smaller African, no strategic countries and all that which seems
                        to be a diminution of the currency. Was this apparent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Yes, it was true, but that has changed in the last decade. As I
                    mentioned, I shared the annual EEO award for assigning more women into AF DCM
                    positions. AF had more than 40 DCM positions, and they are still considered an
                    excellent opportunity to test one's management and leadership skills, and as a
                    stepping stone to greater things. Over time, exceptionally qualified women,
                    women who would be competitive in any organization like Mary Ryan and Roz
                    Ridgeway, would rise to the top no matter what the obstacles. Roz became the
                    Counselor of the Department and the ambassador to Finland and Germany and then
                    assistant secretary for EUR. Carol Laise was the first female DG followed by
                    Joan Clark and then Genta. There was some irony in that in the 90s, certain
                    attractive chief of mission positions in Africa were rejected by women who now
                    had opportunities both in the Department and overseas. By that point the
                    Department was so desperate to assign more women to these senior positions, that
                    women who were serving as office directors or deputy assistant secretaries were
                    offered AF missions, and they'd say, “No, that doesn't interest me.” I know of
                    the case where Dar Es Salaam was offered, the candidate turned it down. An
                    interesting reversal of traditional practice reflecting the new realities in the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>You may recall the origins of the women's class action. Alison Palmer was being
                    assigned to an Arab country, I believe it was Saudi Arabia. The ambassador said
                    he did not want her assigned there because the Arabs would refuse to work with a
                    female officer. Well, that was the prevailing attitude at that time, both in the
                    Middle East and in the U.S. Subsequently we sent female officers out to that
                    part of the world and they've done extraordinarily well, in part because we made
                    clear to the host governments that these officers represented the U.S., and if
                    you want to deal with the U.S., you will have to learn to work with these
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They represent the 800-pound gorilla.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: They represent the United States, exactly. Absolutely, and you
                    foreigners had better accept it because you don't any choice ultimately. Alison
                    Palmer did break down barriers to the benefit of both women and of the U.S.
                    Women were then accepted and as effective as a male officer, and in some cases
                    more so. Women political appointees served with success as Ambassadors to
                    Ireland and Paris. These advances were far more than a sop to women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. One of the things that was put out at one
                        point was that if more women were representing our foreign policy, we would
                        have a gentler, kinder foreign policy. Of course that has had absolutely. Of
                        course, this is coming from the feminist side of, not within the system. It
                        was nonsense and I think all of us knew that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Oh, right. Anybody who knows Roz Ridgeway wouldn't think that way. She
                    was one tough officer, and she wasn't going to make policy any kinder and
                    gentler than it absolutely needed to be to achieve the U.S. interest..</p>
                <pb facs="0267" n="Page0267"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: I did about a year in this special projects office working on these
                    suits and on systems issues. My wife's condition deteriorated markedly in May of
                    1995. She had retired on disability the previous summer and she had been
                    following the macrobiotic diet over the eight months after giving up
                    chemotherapy. She had seemed to be doing well, and she had plenty of energy,
                    which she devoted to the building of our new home in Loudoun County. But, by May
                    things had gotten substantially worse. With Linda's illness and the ages of my
                    two boys, I had long before decided that I didn't want to go overseas again.
                    Once we returned to Washington, taking my two boys back overseas with the
                    limited educational facilities in Africa was just not an option. I had been
                    contemplating early retirement anyway. My wife died in early August of 1995 and
                    I retired in September of '95. My boys and I moved out to our beautiful home in
                    the country, and I have devoted my time primarily to their upbringing.</p>
                <p>It was a great career. I enjoyed virtually every minute of it. In terms of
                    recommending it to people today, I'm not so sure. The Service has changed a
                    great deal, and we don't have the great issues of the bipolar world to address
                    any longer. We do have the terrorism issue and the obligation to play a
                    constructive role in defusing international tensions, but these missions are not
                    the same. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, our focus as a nation is no
                    longer confronting a single threat, but confronting a diverse set of threats.
                    The Service is now also much more subject to being politicized because of the
                    diverse domestic constituencies. This is a corrosive process, which can prove
                    debilitating to a highly talented and well-motivated Foreign Service, but in a
                    democracy, these interests must be served.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Economic, trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WAUCHOPE: Every nation has its unique economic interests, and trade issues
                    abound. This has brought interest groups into play, and the service is pushed
                    and pulled by these interests. Our ability to retain any degree of coherence in
                    our foreign policy is very difficult unless there is an extraordinarily strong
                    Secretary of State who is backed completely by the President. This isn't the
                    case today and it hasn't been in a while, and may not be the case ever again.
                    Looking back over my seven years of retirement, there have been many times that
                    I was glad not to be in the service and have to explain some of the bad
                    decisions made by the Clinton and now, more particularly, by the Bush
                    administration. All this makes the Foreign Service a less attractive career than
                    it was in my time, although, you know, there's no greater job than representing
                    the United States overseas. At least that is how I felt about it in my time in
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
