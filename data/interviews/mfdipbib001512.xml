                <p>[Note: this interview was not edited by Mr. Abington]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 17, 2000. This is an interview with Edward
                        G. Abington. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Shall we start at the
                        beginning? Tell me when and where you were born and something about your
                        family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I was born in March 1943 in Lubbock, Texas. My family on both my
                    mother's side and my father's side were longtime Texas residents. My father was
                    in the Air Force in World War II and continued with an Air Force career. I grew
                    up moving every couple of years all over the country, the Philippines and Guam
                    twice when I was young. Then I went to high school in Orlando, Florida and to
                    university at the University of Florida.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll be going back. Where did your father's family come
                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: They came from Louisiana and from Texas. The original Abington came to
                    the U.S. in the early 1800s, immigrated to Louisiana from Ireland, and
                    eventually the relatives had a plantation in Louisiana south of Shreveport which
                    ended up getting destroyed during the Civil War, but the family stayed in
                    Louisiana and also in Texas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your father go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: He went to Texas Tech for a while but he never completed college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: She was born in a little town near Lubbock, Texas, called Slaton. Her
                    parents had come to Texas from Tennessee in the 1800s. Her father owned grocery
                    stores. She went to North Texas State College for Women. Then she got a master's
                    degree at Tulane University in sociology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she employed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: She worked for a while, but like many women of that era, after she
                    married and particularly after she became pregnant with me, she became a
                    housewife and raising children became her profession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father's specialty in the Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: He was an explosive ordinance officer in World War II. Then after the
                    war was over, he became involved in the American nuclear weapons program, both
                    testing and then the storage and the deployment of nuclear weapons for the
                    Strategic Air Command.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have made everyone in the family pretty aware of
                        what was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Very much so. I can remember being in Florida in high school during the
                    Cuban Missile Crisis in which the airplanes—strategic bombers, the B52s, and I
                    think there were B47s at the time—were deployed out of McCoy Air Force Base.
                    Meanwhile, lots of fighter aircraft came in as well as troops. Awareness of the
                    international situation was very much a part of my life as I was growing up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How is it being an Air Force kid going to different
                        places? Talk about your elementary education.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I went to Guam when I was 6 years old. I was there first, second, and
                    third grades. It was a marvelous experience. It was what every little kid dreams
                    of in terms of just having fun. Housing was pretty terrible. We lived in Quonset
                    huts that were converted into houses. I can remember going out playing on the
                    runway of this air force base, sitting in the cockpits of American and Japanese
                    aircraft left over from World War II, and riding my bicycle up and down the
                    runway where there were old junked aircraft, playing in the jungle, climbing
                    down cliffs, going to beaches, and so forth, snorkeling with my father,
                    collecting seashells. It was a marvelous experience. And the school even at that
                    young age, I can remember studying the history of Guam with mimeographed
                    notebooks that the school had prepared. I was fascinated by it because the
                    material talked about how Marianas became a Spanish possession and then later
                    the United States took it over. And then the history of World War II and so
                    forth. Even being in the first and second grade, the social studies aspect of
                    school really made me fascinated with history and cultures and foreign
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once you get a dose of that, you never get rid of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Guam is an extraordinarily exotic place for a young boy. I still look
                    back at it 45 years later with very fond memories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go when you left Guam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: After Guam, we went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where my father was
                    assigned to Kirkland Air Force Base but coincidentally worked at Sandia at the
                    nuclear labs there. He frequently was gone out to the Pacific and to Nevada
                    where they were conducting nuclear tests. The thing about Albuquerque, I had a
                    marvelous third grade teacher who specialized in American Indian culture. She
                    would take us on field trips, bring in pottery. We learned how to make dyes from
                    dried flowers and from dried sage and things like that which the American
                    Indians had used for hundreds of years. I remember going on field trips with her
                    to pueblos in New Mexico. I was in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a couple of years ago
                    and I went to what was the village of the most famous 20th century American
                    Indian potter, this Indian woman who is dead now but the pottery that she made
                    is in museums and it's really marvelous. I can remember my parents taking me to
                    meet this woman in the 1950s and watching her make pottery and talking to her.
                    We purchased a couple of pieces of her pottery. It was a fascinating experience
                    living in New Mexico at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were moving up, how about reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: At a very early age, 7 or so, my eyesight started to deteriorate. I
                    became very nearsighted. At one point, the doctors thought I would go blind. In
                    fact, it was progressive myopia. I can remember the first time that I got my
                    glasses. My grandmother on my mother's side used to be a schoolteacher and she
                    worked with me a lot to teach me how to read and then to instill a real love of
                    reading. Throughout my youth I would always go to a library, whether it was on a
                    military base in the Philippines or in Guam or in Albuquerque, and I checked out
                    sometimes 12 books at a time, biographies, history books, adventure books. I
                    have always been a very avid reader. It started when I was very young.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a wonderful thing to get started on. After
                        Albuquerque, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: After Albuquerque we went back to Guam for a couple of years. I resumed
                    shell collecting and wandering in the jungle. We had a beach house down on the
                    beach and used to go hunting lobsters at night with spears and waterproof
                    flashlights and cook the lobsters in a big pot on the beach. Again, it was a
                    really interesting time.</p>
                <p>From there, we went to the Philippines, Clark Air Base. My father was reassigned
                    to Clark. I guess there I would have been in the eighth and ninth grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: That was about 1955-'57.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Clark a world apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: It was a world apart. It was a huge military base. I recall reading
                    that Clark Air Base was the largest U.S. military facility in the world. It had
                    everything. We lived on the parade ground of Clark Base where MacArthur had
                    lived. We lived in an old house that was about 100 years old, mahogany, right in
                    front of the parade ground. But we were not so isolated because my father had
                    friends from World War II who had settled in Manila so that we frequently went
                    to Manila and visited those friends. There were Americans married to Filipinos
                    who had made their business there. These people basically were lumber exporters.
                    I remember flying out to islands in the Philippines with them to look at trees
                    that were being harvested and collecting shells and things like that. I had a
                    real sense of being in the Philippines. It was not like what happens sometimes
                    in the military where you go to a military base overseas and you never leave it.
                    We always left. My father became active in the Boy Scouts and the Explorers and
                    we used to take canoe trips on rivers in the Philippines and hikes in the
                    jungles and things like that. It was a fascinating experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then off to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Then we went to Florida in 1958, where I started high school. I spent 3
                    years of high school. I spent all 3 years at the same high school, which for me
                    was a terrific experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the problems of moving around so much. And
                        high school is probably the most critical time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I could not have asked for a better experience in terms of high school.
                    It was in Orlando, Florida. It was at the end of the Eisenhower administration
                    with all that entailed in terms of an idyllic time. It was a segregated high
                    school. I had not been around African-Americans enough to where I really thought
                    about that as an issue. That was before the civil rights movement started in the
                    U.S. The teachers were good. It was before there was a drug problem. It was
                    before kids were out drinking and so forth. I had an all-American experience at
                    high school, good friends, good clean fun, good teachers, a good academic
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the academic side and then the
                        extracurricular side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: On the academic side, I've always been quite interested in social
                    studies, history, political science, and so forth. I had really marvelous
                    teachers in the humanities and English and geography and things like that.
                    Because I had lived in different places, they encouraged me to speak about that.
                    It seemed that the other students were quite interested in what I had done and
                    where I had been and what I had experienced. I used to bring in slides from Guam
                    and the Philippines and do slide shows and talk about what it was like to live
                    there and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're very fortunate because I know my kids
                        experienced, as so many Foreign Service kids do, they feel almost shut out
                        when they go to a school in the States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. That's true. I talked to Foreign Service kids who have that
                    experience. But my experience was the exact opposite. My peers and my teachers
                    were quite interested in where I had been and what I had done. I used to bring
                    in my shell collection and show it and explain it and talk about the history of
                    Guam or the Philippines. These people were interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the extracurricular side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I never had been much of an athlete, but I was very active in student
                    government. I had elected offices and belonged to a number of clubs. The thing
                    that was so good about the school was that being smart was encouraged and looked
                    upon as a plus. Many of the football players were also in the honor society. So,
                    you had a really good blend of academics and sports and student government and
                    so forth. If you were smart but not athletic, then that was fine and you were
                    accepted and encouraged. It was an extremely nurturing environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume by this time with bad eyes this must have kept
                        you from looking towards the Air Force as a career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I never really thought too much about the military as a career. It was
                    not something that interested me. From high school on, I had an interest in
                    cultures abroad, in history and government and foreign policy. Over time in
                    college I drifted more towards those subjects and that pointed me in the
                    direction of a diplomatic career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: In 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling at school? The Missile Crisis was
                        '62. Where were you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I had started off in college at Texas Tech. I started off in pre-med,
                    which was the wrong choice for me. I thought I wanted to be a doctor. My best
                    friend was going to be a doctor and in fact became a urologist. I thought that
                    that was what I should do. But I don't think that's where my interests or my
                    talents were. So, I spent a year at Texas Tech. I didn't do very well at school
                    and dropped out for a while. I was in Orlando at home working in 1962. We lived
                    at McCoy Air Force Base when the Cuban Missile Crisis hit. My father was called
                    off. He left when they moved the B52s out of McCoy but then they brought fighter
                    jets in as well as troops by train.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it the feeling was that the balloon might go up at
                        any moment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. It was an extraordinary time. People did feel, particularly being
                    there in Florida, which was kind of like ground zero, there was real concern
                    that there could be a U.S.-Soviet war over Cuba. Some people left and drove
                    north. We stayed there the entire time. But people were really glued to their
                    radios and televisions in terms of trying to figure out what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this interim period while you were figuring out how
                        not to be a doctor, what were you after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: At that point, I transferred to the University of Florida, which was
                    closer to home and where a lot of my high school friends went to school. It was
                    a much better fit than having been in Texas, which was a long ways away and I
                    was kind of lonely. I stayed with pre-med for a little bit but then I switched
                    over to psychology for a while. I also worked. I worked my way through college.
                    I had jobs where I paid my tuition, my books, all my living expenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I learned how to be a surgical technician. Over the course of 4 or 5
                    years, I took part in 2-3,000 operations where I would set up the surgical
                    table, do all the instruments, and would basically assist the surgeons as they
                    were operating. That was a skill that was in demand. There was a teaching
                    hospital at the University of Florida. It paid enougI worked about 20 hours a
                    week and carried about 17-18 hours academicallto pay my way through college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself being sucked back towards the
                        medical side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Not really. If anything, the experience confirmed that I didn't want to
                    be a doctor, that wasn't the right field for me. Eventually I changed my major
                    to political science and history and I really enjoyed that tremendously. From
                    that point on, I had a 4.0 average and it was quite clear that that was where my
                    interests lay. It was not hard studying. It was fun learning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Florida concentrated on Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: To a degree, but there was a lot of Cold War studies. There was a
                    professor, John Spanier, who had written books on the Cold War, on the Korean
                    War. He wrote a very well known book on the Truman firing of MacArthur and the
                    Korean War. The thrust of my studies was much more towards international
                    relations and general political science, constitutional law and how interest
                    groups work and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Foreign Service and diplomatic service cross your
                        radar at all during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: There were a couple of things. One, this was the time when the Vietnam
                    War was starting to heat up. It became increasingly controversial on campus,
                    although much less so in a southern school like Florida than out on the West
                    Coast or up on the East Coast. Secondly, it was a time when the civil rights
                    movement was really kicking off and people became much more aware of it. I
                    participated in marches in Alabama and elsewhere on civil rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the University of Florida stand on
                        integration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: They were basically a segregated school, but during the time I was
                    there the first black students started attending. The football team was all
                    white. It was a white boy's football team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there disquiet at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was some disquiet. The South at that time was still trying to
                    come to grips with the past and with the fact that African-Americans were in a
                    secondary position in just about all aspects of society and were fighting that.
                    It was a time of controversy. It was not nearly as difficult as Alabama or
                    Georgia or Mississippi or Louisiana but there was some violence, there were
                    demonstrations with people being arrested, both white and black
                    demonstrators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think in Florida you seem to have two cultures.
                        One is sort of a real backwoods almost cracker culture as opposed to Miami,
                        which had a very strong Jewish, international environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Exactly. Florida was very much that way. An influence on me was a
                    Foreign Service officer who was spending a year as a diplomat in residence. His
                    specialty was Latin America. I remember going to a few lectures that he gave and
                    talking to him about the Foreign Service. It sparked my interest. I became very
                    interested in the Foreign Service as a career as a result of talking to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right now, I'm interviewing Pierce Bullen, who became an
                        Arabist. He went to the University of Florida. He was grabbed by this, too.
                        It's one of the places that probably sends people? I guess it's much more of
                        an international feel, as you would get from the University of California or
                        the East Coast. It's not a Midwestern look.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I think the University of Florida by virtue of its location and
                    Florida's interaction with Latin America had a more international outlook than
                    other places. It was a state school. Some programs were good and some were not.
                    There certainly was an environment that encouraged me to look beyond Florida.
                    There were professors that encouraged that as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from Florida when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I completed a bachelor's degree in '66 in political science and a
                    master's degree in '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you pointed towards at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I took the Foreign Service exam in 1966. I passed it the first time
                    around and passed the oral exam. I got on the register. I very much wanted to go
                    into the Foreign Service, but there was a hiring freeze on and they were not
                    taking in any new classes at that time. So, there was a CIA recruiter on campus
                    and I signed up for that. I filled out all the forms and was interviewed and got
                    a security clearance. While my preference very much was the Foreign Service, it
                    was the CIA that offered me a job. I ended up coming to Washington in the fall
                    of 1967 and was brought on board the CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me what your impression was of the CIA? How
                        did they take a young person out of the university and what did they do with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: At that point, they did not have a very good training program. They
                    just basically brought you on board and put you into a job and you learned on
                    the job. I ended up working in the Office of Strategic Analysis. We were looking
                    at Soviet defensive missile deployments in the Soviet Union and East Europe and
                    doing analytical studies that were used by the military for strategic purposes,
                    used to justify an American defensive military program. Basically there was no
                    training. They just brought you on board, gave you a period of indoctrination,
                    emphasizing security and sources and methods and put you in a job and had you
                    start writing and analyzing stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you're interested in the Foreign Service, was there a
                        prospect of getting out and going overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I was brought on board to work in the Deputy Directorate of
                    Intelligence, the analytical side, not the operations side. So, I do not know if
                    there would have been a prospect for me to cross over into the operations side
                    or not. The reason was that in May of 1968 I got drafted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were at the CIA '67-'68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, not even a year at CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The CIA didn't give you any cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: No. At that point, my draft board was in Orlando, Florida. They were
                    breathing down my neck. Exemptions that I had had as a result of being a student
                    at the University of Florida had run out. I got drafted. The month that I was
                    drafted was the month of the Tet offensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: January or February of '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: That was when I got the draft notice. That month they drafted 68,000
                    Americans. That was about the population of Gainesville, Florida, where I went
                    to college. It was as if they had taken every man, woman, and child in
                    Gainesville and put them in the military. The CIA didn't do anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: It was a pretty scary time. Casualties were high in Vietnam and anyone
                    that was drafted felt that they were going to be cannon fodder. I tried to
                    enlist as to go to OCS to become an officer. The Navy and the Air Force turned
                    me down because of my eyesight. But I thought that the Army was going to accept
                    me, although I really hadn't thought this through very well because the casualty
                    rate for second lieutenants out of Army OCS was pretty bad in Vietnam. I
                    arranged to report to Richmond, Virginia, to be inducted for OCS the day before
                    I was due to report for the draft. I went down to Richmond. After some
                    confusion, they told me that I had failed the physical for OCS because of my
                    eyes. So I went back up to Washington and the next morning went back to Richmond
                    and was drafted into the U.S. Army. I went to basic training at Fort Benning,
                    Georgia, and I recall that I was the oldest person in the company of some 200
                    persons. I had the most education of anyone in the company. It was very
                    interesting because I was kind of an oddity. Most of the people in the company
                    were either blacks without a college education or whites without a college
                    education or maybe one or two years. It showed that the draft managed to pick up
                    mainly the people who couldn't afford to go to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was part of Johnson's unholy compromise. He basically
                        kept a lot of the educated people from getting too involved in the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was one other guy who had been to college. He had been in the
                    Foreign Service and was drafted while in the Foreign Service. But he and I were
                    really the oddities in this company. I completed basic training at Fort Benning,
                    Georgia, and went from there to Fort McClellan, Alabama, for advanced infantry
                    training, which was preparatory to going to Vietnam as a rifleman. As it turned
                    out, while I was in training there, my mother died. I left training and went to
                    Texas for the funeral and spent a week with family there. When I came back to
                    Fort McClellan, I learned that I had been assigned to the Pentagon instead of
                    being assigned to Vietnam, which the majority of the people in the company had
                    been assigned to. I was sent to the Pentagon to work in the office of the Army
                    Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence. There were 40-50 officers in this
                    office, which was basically a current intelligence office. They prepared daily
                    briefings for the senior Army leadership, the Army Chief of Staff on down. My
                    job was to make viewgraphs to be used in the briefings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Projected overhead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Right. Also to make coffee, empty burn bags, sweep the floor, things
                    like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it 50 officers and one enlisted man?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: No, there were about six of them. But I was the gopher. I did that for
                    eight or nine months and then I was reassigned to an Army intelligence unit, an
                    analytical unit at the National Security Agency [NSA]. This unit worked with
                    SIGINT [Signal Intelligence] to do order of battle. I was put into a small
                    section of 5-6 people. I was the only enlisted man and there were 4 or 5
                    officers. As it turned out, I was the only one with a master's degree. I wasn't
                    officially in charge of the unit, but I was substantively in charge of the unit.
                    We were working on the Middle East. That was really my introduction to the
                    Middle East.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: This was three years after the '67 war. At that point, Soviet military
                    assistance stepped up and there were increasing confrontations between the
                    Egyptians and the Israelis. This was the war of attrition back and forth across
                    the Suez Canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking mainly at what was happening to the
                        Egyptian and Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, and also the Iraqis. We were very interested in what the Iraqis
                    were up to as well both because of their disagreements with Iran, which had not
                    yet flared up really seriously, but concern over Iraqi military intentions
                    vis-a-vis Israel. They had participated in and sent troops to Syria during the
                    '67 war. Then we were also watching what was happening in Jordan. There were
                    foreign military contingents there. The Pakistanis had a military contingent in
                    Jordan and Pakistani pilots were flying for Syria, Libya, for Jordan also. In
                    fact, Zia ul-Haq, the former president of Pakistan who died in '88, was
                    commander of the Pakistani military contingent in Jordan at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were moving up towards Black September. That was
                        September of '70. Were we picking up things about that at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. At that point, there was growing tension between the Jordanian
                    military and the PLO units in Jordan. There were increasing clashes between the
                    PLO units and the Israelis. The Israelis were carrying out raids into Jordan.
                    The Jordanian military was standing by and not doing anything. King Hussein was
                    unwilling to commit the military either against the Israelis or against the
                    Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was around the time when King Hussein went to visit a
                        military unit and somebody had a pair of women's panties-</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: He tied a panty and a brassier to the radio antenna of a tank or a jeep
                    to show the military was quite displeased with the way things were going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you bring yourself up to speed on these countries
                        which probably didn't mean very much to you at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I did a lot of reading. I would read intelligence reports and studies
                    and so forth. The Army used to put out country handbooks, which I would read and
                    try to learn as much as I could about the countries that we were dealing
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did you feel our intelligence effort was plugged
                        into the Israeli military and Israeli intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I couldn't really judge that from where I was. The service branches? I
                    did come away with a very strong feeling that when it came to strategic or
                    national level intelligence, the service brancheArmy, Air Force, Navsimply
                    didn't know what they were doing. They didn't have well-trained people. They did
                    not have in-depth expertise. What they did was plagiarize the intelligence
                    reporting done by CIA or State Department or whatever. The other very clear
                    impression I came away with, particularly when I was at the Pentagon, was that
                    these statistics that were used with regard to destruction of vehicles and the
                    death of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers in Vietnam were totally phony.
                    There was something called Operation Rolling Thunder, the bombing campaign of
                    North Vietnam. I can remember these viewgraphs that we had to prepare saying
                    “350 trucks destroyed” and so forth. After doing this a couple of months, you
                    figure we're destroying several hundred trucks a day. If you multiply that by
                    30, you say, “Where are the Soviets, the Chinese, and the North Vietnamese
                    getting all these trucks?” It became quite obvious that the statistics were
                    meaningless. They were cooked by the military in Vietnam, by MACV, and fed to
                    people back in Washington. They were baloney.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there talk about this being baloney?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was some talk, but there was also just “Keep your head down. Go
                    ahead and do it. Serve your time in the military and get out.” That was in
                    general everyone's attitude.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, with no children.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: She went to the University of Florida. She was from West Virginia. She
                    worked at Woodward and Lothrop when we were here in Washington and then at the
                    Washington Post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were in the military. We're talking about
                        '68-'70. This was a time of huge demonstrations. Was there any problem being
                        in the military at that time? How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I was very much against the Vietnam War but not to the extent that I
                    was willing to go to Canada to avoid the draft. It set up a tremendous conflict
                    in me. I was against the war but my father was a career military officer. I went
                    to school in the South. It was a conservative environment that I grew up in.
                    Basically, I just decided to do my time in the military and get out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you keeping your options open with the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Very much so. In fact, I was in touch with the State Department. While
                    I was still in the military out at Fort Meade they offered me an appointment in
                    a junior officer class in April of 1970. The military agreed to release me a
                    couple of months early to join the Foreign Service. I ended up being discharged
                    from the military one day and the next day- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>The next day, I was sworn into the Foreign Service at the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In April of '70. What was your basic officers group
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There were a couple of veterans from the military. We tended to be in
                    the minority. There was one guy who had been a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and
                    had received several medals for bravery. We became great friends and remain so
                    to this day. His name is Ed Fugit. He's retired now and lives down in Tampa,
                    Florida. I found as I looked at the biographies of the class that I was a
                    combined USIA-State Department class. There were roughly 20% women. As I read
                    through the biographies, I found it quite intimidating because the majority of
                    people had gone to Ivy League colleges, had pedigrees that looked considerably
                    more distinguished than mine and it made me wonder what I was getting into.
                    Would I be able to compete with these people?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I certainly had that feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Here I was, a kid who worked his way through college, went to a state
                    university, not an Ivy League school, had been drafted into the military, didn't
                    have any money or anything, and I certainly felt a little intimidated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1970 were you picking up any feeling about
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you all up to? April '70 was the Cambodian
                        incursion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. There were demonstrations in Washington and a number of us from
                    the Foreign Service class went out and participated in the demonstration against
                    the Cambodian incursion.</p>
                <p>The State Department had used the junior officer class to? When they brought
                    people in prior to our class for several years, they had offered people
                    appointment in the Foreign Service on the condition that they would join the
                    CORDS program, which was a program for rural development in South Vietnam.
                    People were brought into the Foreign Service, went through a junior officer
                    class, studied Vietnamese, and then were sent off for a couple of years to
                    Vietnam in this program. There was a real rebellion by preceding junior officer
                    classes. My junior officer class was the very first one where the CORDS program
                    was not a condition for coming in. I can't recall if people went to Vietnam or
                    not. I think maybe one or two did. But you were not basically forced to go to
                    Vietnam as a condition for coming into the Foreign Service. I can remember that
                    as officials from the State Department came to lecture the junior officer class
                    they were met with a large degree of skepticism and on some occasions real
                    hostility in terms of our policy towards Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your training, there was a petition sent around
                        that became public opposing our moving into Cambodia. It became public and
                        Nixon told the Secretary to fire those guys. Nothing happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: That was done in the immediate class before mine. That is where the
                    whole CORDS thing collapsed. I had a friend who had been in that preceding
                    class. As the junior officers sat down and started talking to each other in that
                    preceding class, they found that some people were brought into the Foreign
                    Service into the junior officer class under the CORDS program and were told,
                    “The only way you can get into the Foreign Service is if you sign up for the
                    CORDS program.” Other people were brought in without that and it created a
                    tremendous uproar within the class. They had a near rebellion when they met with
                    State Department people and the people who were running the junior officer
                    class. It was at that point where the State Department dropped the CORDS
                    requirement. It was in that class that people signed the petition against the
                    Cambodian incursion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about training for the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I did the junior officer class and the consular class. I thought the
                    training wasn't bad. It gave me some confidence vis-a-vis my classmates because
                    as we discussed issues, as we went through scenarios about what would work and
                    how you would act in certain circumstances, to me it was a real eye opener. I
                    felt that some of the people who had these Ivy League backgrounds didn't seem to
                    have any world experience. As they went through these scenarios, the kind of
                    actions that they were advocating I thought were absolutely foolish, very
                    ideological and so forth and simply wouldn't work. It made me realize in the
                    junior officer class that good judgment is absolutely critical and if you don't
                    have that you're not going to get very far in the Foreign Service. I felt that I
                    brought a degree of maturity and good judgment to starting this new career that
                    some of my other colleagues didn't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were picking up the peak of the time when if you were
                        under 30 and you got a good education, you were invincible and were born
                        without sin. It was a very ideological time. The people who rose up? There
                        is something about having some time as an enlisted man that brings you down
                        to earth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Absolutely. It's not only a humbling experience but to be drafted into
                    the Army during the height of the Vietnam fighting is a very scary thing. It's
                    one thing to demonstrate and be on campus and be against the war. It's quite
                    another thing when you're faced with a draft notice and you have to decide what
                    you're going to do and make decisions that will affect your future for years and
                    years to come. Also, I didn't come from a privileged background. I worked my way
                    through college. I feel like I pulled myself up by my bootstraps. That gave me
                    some confidence and some maturity that some of my colleagues didn't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also probably knocked out a bit of the arrogance of the
                        predominant mood among an awful lot of young people who were coming out of
                        college in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I wasn't arrogant. I was scared. I was scared that I would fail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, did they give you choices? Were you
                        at least mentally planning out an area or a specialization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. They give you a list of posts and you put down 3 or 4 and then the
                    people who run the junior officer class match up the person to the place and
                    where the need of the Service is. I was interested based on my experience in the
                    Army in the Middle East. So, I put down my first choice of Beirut and was
                    assigned in the junior officer class to be a consular officer in Beirut and
                    consular training and French language training. But I never got to Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a language at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: No. I think American universities, at least the University of Florida,
                    were pretty weak in languages. I had some French but certainly not good enough
                    to function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: It was the last week of the consular course. The person running the
                    course called me up and said that in the Near East Bureau the country
                    directorate for Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon, there was a new junior officer
                    position that had just been created. They had a big workload. Would I be
                    interested in going over and interviewing for the job, meeting with the country
                    director, Talcott Seelye? I said, “Sure.” They said, “We normally don't assign
                    people to the Department for their first tour. We like to send people overseas
                    for their first tour. But if the country director likes you and offers you the
                    job and you want to do it, we would assign you and break your assignment to
                    Beirut.” So, I went and interviewed with Talcott Seelye. I think he liked what I
                    said. He offered me the job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you pulled on your time dealing with the order of

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, I told him what I had done and what my background had been. He
                    asked if I wanted to do it and I said, “Yes, I'd be very interested in doing
                    it.”</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: From 1970 to 1972. I joined the Jordan desk as a junior desk officer in
                    August of 1970 just a few weeks before the multiple hijackings which occurred on
                    Labor Day and then led to Black September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when the PLO high-jacked three planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: That's correct. I think it was the PFLP, the Popular Front for the
                    Liberation of Palestine led by George Habash.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the hierarchy? Talcott Seelye was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: He was the country director. Also on the desk were Tom Scotes, who
                    became Ambassador to Yemen and in 1973 went in and opened up the U.S. presence
                    in Damascus after the '73 war. There was Andy Killgore, who had been a Middle
                    East specialist for 20-30 years. He became Ambassador in Doha. Peter Sutherland,
                    who became Ambassador to a Gulf country. And for a very short period of time
                    Pierce Bullen was in the office as well. He was a longtime State Department
                    Arabist. The Assistant Secretary was Joe Sisco. Roger Davies was the principal
                    deputy assistant secretary. Roy Atherton had responsibility for the Middle East
                    Arab-Israeli issues. Talcott Seelye reported to Roy Atherton. Chris Van Hollen
                    was the deputy for South Asia. There was another deputy for the Gulf, but I
                    can't remember who that was right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I joined the desk right before the hijackings. At that point, the
                    situation in Jordan was very tense. There had been an assistant Army attach�
                    that had been assassinated in Amman by Palestinians. They had come up to his
                    house and shot him, killed him in his house. There had been a drawdown of the
                    embassy. The ambassador was Harrison Symmes. He had been kicked out. The
                    Jordanians had asked for his recall. At that point, the relationship between the
                    CIA, the station chief, and King Hussein was much stronger than between Hussein
                    and the American Ambassador. Symmes ran afoul of that relationship and did not
                    have Hussein's confidence. As a result, Hussein asked for his recall. It was a
                    time when a senior American delegation was going from Tel Aviv across the
                    Allenby Bridge to Amman. They had a very risky time because of the PLO presence
                    and it was a time in which Jordan was in tremendous turmoil. They were on an ice
                    edge of whether the PLO was going to take Jordan over, overthrow the government.
                    It was a very tense and uncertain time. That was the environment in which I
                    joined the desk.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harry Symmes had told Joe Sisco, “Don't come.” It wasn't
                        safe. The King took great affront at this. This precipitated his
                        recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: That's right. I wouldn't say it precipitated it. I would say that was
                    the last straw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the new boy on the block, which is interesting
                        because you're not coming in with preconceived ideas but you're listening.
                        What was the feeling? Did they feel Hussein was going to make it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: This was a time of great turmoil in the Middle East. There was the
                    situation in Jordan which was extraordinarily unstable. The feeling was that it
                    was very questionable whether Hussein was going to make it or not. I certainly
                    think that that was the feeling in the NEA front office with people like Joe
                    Sisco and Roy Atherton. It was also a time when Soviet involvement in Egypt was
                    increasing. The War of Attrition, the artillery duels were heating up. The
                    Israelis started carrying out penetration bombing of Egypt. The Egyptians had
                    increasingly appealed for better Soviet fighter jet. Eventually the Soviet
                    pilots started flying combat missions over Egypt and engaging in air clashes
                    with Israeli fighter pilots. It was a time of danger and turmoil in the Middle
                    East. The approximate cause was the Arab-Israeli conflict but the backdrop was
                    the U.S.-Soviet competition over the Middle East. Of course, Kissinger was in
                    the White House as the national security advisor. Rogers was the Secretary of
                    State. Nixon was President. It was a time of high stakes and being a junior
                    officer and getting a bird's eye view of this was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine it was. Were you looking at Syria at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: To a degree, but the Jordan crisis kind of overwhelmed people. On Labor
                    Day I had been out and I got home and there was a phone call from Talcott
                    Seelye. He said there had been these multiple hijackings. He asked if I would
                    come in and pull the graveyard shift in the Operations Center. They were setting
                    up a task force. At that point, the State Department and the Operations Center
                    had not had experience in setting up a task force and in running a situation
                    like this. Here you had multiple aircraft high-jacked, increasing turmoil in the
                    streets of Amman, a new ambassador, Dean Brown. I remember a photograph of Dean
                    presenting his credentials to the King. He was taken to the palace in an APC.
                    The hijackings provided the catalyst for the confrontation between the
                    Jordanians and the PLO. I spent 3 or 4 months working 7 days a week 12 hours a
                    day in the Operations Center first with the high-jacking, then with the civil
                    war and the threat of Syrian invasion of Lebanon and then the Israelis with U.S.
                    urging, Kissinger working with Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin to really put the
                    pressure on the Syrians to keep them out of Jordan. This was a geopolitical
                    struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. I was this junior officer in a
                    catbird seat watching all of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The situation was that the Syrians were putting some armor
                        down there and the Israelis more or less made it known that if they did they
                        would come in and-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: The Syrians deployed armor but not air. They had deployed their air
                    assets. Of course, Hafez El-Assad at the time was the chief of the air force and
                    he refused to use Syrian air force. The army actually crossed the Syrian-Jordan
                    border with tanks. King Hussein was increasingly frantic and was calling for
                    U.S. and Israeli air strikes in order to fend off the Syrians. But as it turned
                    out, the Jordanian army fought hard. They carried out a tank battle against the
                    Syrians and defeated them. The Syrians withdrew back across the border.
                    Meanwhile, Kissinger was masterminding this with Yitzhak Rabin. The Israelis
                    made it very clear that if Syria were to invade Jordan, Israel would look upon
                    this as a threat to its security and would act against Syria. The threats made
                    by Israel, the action of the Jordanian military, and the very strong statements
                    both publicly and privately by Kissinger and Nixon defused what could have been
                    a situation that could have sucked the U.S. and the Soviets into something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Iraqis part of the equation at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was an Iraqi contingent in Jordan. Certainly people were keeping
                    their eye on the Iraqis. But basically the Iraqis sat by and just watched what
                    was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Pakistanis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: They were still there. There would be occasional air clashes between
                    the Syrians and the Israelis. These were clashes between Pakistani pilots and
                    Jordanians, but the Jordanians were very careful because their air force had
                    been decimated in '67. But the Pakistanis were flying for the Syrians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling that you were picking up from the
                        desk about the Palestinians in Jordan and what their orientation was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was deep concern because Hussein had been such a friend of the
                    U.S. for such a long time. Hussein was looked upon despite his ill-considered
                    decision to join Nasser in the '67 as someone who the U.S. could deal with, a
                    friend of the West, a friend of the United States, anti-Soviet. There was very
                    deep concern that Palestinians could overthrow the Hashemite regime and you
                    would have a very unstable situation with the PLO taking over the East Bank,
                    that it would become open to Soviet influence and perhaps Soviet presence. Quite
                    clearly the stakes were felt to be extremely high.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I was up in the Operations Center during that period. I was there when Sisco and
                    Atherton would come up. It was a small group that was running this whole thing.
                    I was right there in the middle of it, occasionally writing end comments for
                    Sisco or Atherton. I recall being in a room when Secretary Rogers came in and we
                    set up a live teletype conference between Dean Brown in Amman and Secretary
                    Rogers. Communications then were still relatively primitive compared to today.
                    You didn't have voice communication because of the fighting. The only way that
                    they could communicate real time was to have a communicator in Washington typing
                    out the question for the Secretary and a communicator on the other end with Dean
                    Brown there answering the question or giving his assessment. I think as a junior
                    officer, a first tour officer, one cannot ask for a more exciting initial tour
                    in the State Department unless you're in Amman on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel about Secretary Rogers and
                        Kissinger on this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. I was looking at it from a junior officer's viewpoint. As time
                    went on, and this lasted over a number of weeks, it became increasingly clear
                    that the shots were being called in the White House with Nixon and Kissinger and
                    that Rogers was not a big player in it. Sisco was a player because Sisco, who
                    was not really a career FS officer but a civil service person who became
                    Assistant Secretary of IO because he was a marvelous bureaucrat, Italian origin?
                    When you talk about Machiavellian, Sisco was that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that you were part of a
                        player?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. There was the feeling that because Sisco was there, the bureau was
                    much more involved than would have otherwise been the case. To the extent that
                    the State Department was a player in this drama, it was in large measure because
                    of Sisco and his influence. It's very interesting. Sisco saw Kissinger as a
                    rival and tried to take him on. I saw him take on Kissinger over Cyprus and
                    lost. The interesting thing is that Sisco then despite his going head to head
                    against Kissinger and losing, he managed to work with Kissinger and ultimately
                    became Under Secretary for Political Affairs and a very important player in the
                    peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, did you get any feeling for the
                        attitude towards Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: It was a very anti-Israeli feeling. I felt that some of the old-line
                    Arabists had an unreconstructed view towards Israel, that it never should have
                    been created, that it was a mistake, that it hurt American influence in the
                    Middle East, that it was against our national interest. At times, I felt some of
                    the views bordered on anti-Semitism.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: These people came out of a different historical perspective and the
                    State Department was a different place, in the past an elitist? much less open
                    to the currents in American society and to a degree out of touch with American
                    society and American politics. They possibly were bemoaning some of the
                    individuals, Jewish influence and so forth. It seemed that they did not have a
                    very sophisticated viewpoint of the American political system and how it
                    operated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within NEA, were there people who had served in Israel who
                        were playing much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: The head of the Israel desk, Haywood Stackhouse, was a very fine man,
                    had been the political counselor in Tel Aviv prior to becoming country director.
                    You had another fellow named Walter Burgess Smith who was head of the Egypt
                    desk. He was brought on board because he was a Sovietologist. He did not have
                    Middle East experience, but Sisco put him in the job because he wanted someone
                    with a Soviet background, which became very important in terms of the situation
                    in '70/'71 when the Soviets were building up their presence in Egypt. Roy
                    Atherton? I can't remember if he had served in Tel Aviv at that point or not. He
                    had been in Damascus or Aleppo at the time of the '67 war. Roy had an
                    extraordinarily balanced point of view. He was the DAS that my office reported
                    to. He was just a very balanced person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there were efforts within NEA to say,
                        “Come on, fellows, let's take a look at Israel as being on the ground?
                        Things aren't going to go back. Let's deal with the reality?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Oh, yes. I think if you look at people like Walter Smith, head of the
                    Egypt desk, Stackhouse, head of the Israel desk, Joe Sisco, Roy Atherton, Roger
                    Davies, they had a sophisticated point of view. You might hear frustration in
                    dealing with Israel, but you didn't hear this kind of “Israel never should have
                    been created” point of view that you heard from some people. The people who were
                    in charge of the bureau, the influential people in the bureau, had a
                    sophisticated point of view about Israel, its place, the conflict between the
                    Israelis and the Arabs, and the overlay of Soviet-American rivalry in the Middle
                    East because of the conflict. I never felt that people like Sisco and Atherton
                    ever had this bias in the slightest.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Absolutely. It was an issue of tremendous concern. Sisco and Walter
                    Smith had made several trips to Moscow to discuss the Egyptian-Israeli situation
                    and to work with the Soviets to try to put some breaks on what is considered to
                    be a dangerously escalating situation but without much success. Part of the
                    reason that they were not successful in my view was that this war of attrition
                    was going on and the Israelis were not willing to take casualties from artillery
                    barrages along the Suez Canal. They therefore started carrying out deep
                    penetration bombings of Egypt, including in the area around Aswan. That
                    heightened Egyptian concern and Soviet concern. There was some fear that the
                    Israelis might even go so far as to bomb the dam at Aswan. Doing so would have
                    caused a catastrophic flood. Who knows what loss of life it would have caused.
                    The Israelis by taking the initiative and not fighting the war the way that the
                    Egyptians wanted to fight it escalated the fighting and the tension and created
                    a situation where the Egyptians were increasingly desperate and turned to the
                    Soviets. The Soviets felt that their prestige was on the line because Egypt was
                    their client. That led to the deployment of more sophisticated surface to air
                    missiles in Egypt, the dispatch of better fighter aircraft, and eventually to
                    Soviet military pilots to fly combat air missions over Egypt. The Soviets I
                    don't think ever crossed the Suez Canal, but they were fighting defensive
                    missions in Egypt and on occasion engaging in air to air battles with Israeli
                    pilots. That created a very volatile situation. Given the anti-Soviet cast of
                    Nixon and Kissinger, this soon took on the cast of a U.S.-Soviet confrontation
                    between our respective clients. So the Soviet aspect was something that
                    preoccupied the NEA leadership on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any leader of the Palestinians that we
                        identified? I can't remember when Arafat came on the scene.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: He was on the scene at the time I joined. He was in Jordan. He was head
                    of the Fatwa. We pretty much looked upon all of the leaders of the various
                    factions as being radical, as willing to carry out attacks of terrorishijackings
                    and so fortas being a very destabilizing influence. Of course, at that time the
                    Arab states were manipulating the Palestinian question to their own advantage
                    and you had different Palestinian groups which were sponsored by Arab
                    stateSyria, Iraq, etc. often with Syrian troops funded by the Syrians. For
                    example, Sifa was totally a Syrian creation. There were Palestinian leaders but
                    it was funded by the Syrians. Syrian troops without uniforms participated as
                    members of Sifa. They had bases in Syria and were trained there, etc. So, from
                    the point of view of Washington at that point there were no moderate Palestinian
                    leaders among the Fedayeen groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '70, how did this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I basically spent about three months in the Operations Center starting
                    first with the hijackings. My role was to liaise with the families and the
                    representatives of TWA and to brief them, to talk to them - it was almost like a
                    consular roland to feed them information such as we knew about the well-being of
                    the passengers. The PFLP destroyed the airplanes, blew them up at Dawson's
                    Landing, and then took the passengers and brought them to various places. It was
                    an extraordinarily tense period because fighting had broken out between the
                    Palestinians, the PLO, and the Jordanians. People did not know the whereabouts
                    or well-being of the passengers. There were a number of Jewish Americans who
                    were held captive. People were deeply concerned. Communications were uncertain
                    between the embassy in Amman and the State Department. When the fighting really
                    broke out, it was in the area where the embassy was located so that our
                    diplomats could not get out. But we managed to be in touch with some of the
                    hostages and some of the PLO groups. Some of them were held in the old
                    Philadelphia Hotel not far from the embassy. Embassy officers managed to get
                    there, talk to George Habash and other people. So, it was a fascinating period.
                    As the hostages eventually were released, we returned to the fighting and
                    monitoring it The fighting went on for some time, maybe as long as a year, as
                    the Jordanian army gradually mopped up and expelled Palestinian units from
                    Jordan. By and large, these units ended up in Lebanon. Then there was kind of
                    the reconstruction effort. After the fighting, the United States put together an
                    aid package and tried to help put things back together in Jordan. I was involved
                    in all these phases. First, it was the hijackings. Then it was the monitoring of
                    the fighting and trying to ensure that the Jordanians were staying on top of the
                    situation and not being threatened. And then working on the aid program,
                    bringing in food and medicine and reconstruction. That took about 6 months.</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: At that point, I was hooked on the Middle East. One cannot imagine a
                    more exciting introduction. In addition, I got a chance as a junior officer to
                    work very closely with Joe Sisco. I would sit in as his staff aide. I became one
                    of his favorite notetakers. He would always say, “Write down what I should have
                    said, not what I said.” It became somewhat of a joke at the reporting tables.
                    Joe Sisco's meetings were frequently edited to reflect what he should have said.
                    I worked closely with Roy Atherton. I did an awful lot of note taking for him.
                    Roy encouraged me to stay interested in the Middle East. He helped me get an
                    assignment to Tel Aviv. I went from the Jordan desk via French language training
                    so I could get off language probation and then I went out to the embassy in Tel
                    Aviv as a junior political officer. My responsibilities were the Golan Heights,
                    what the Israelis were doing, their settlement activity, Gaza, and Israeli
                    Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. We'll pick it up the next time from '72. How long

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Until '75.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is November 2, 2000. Before you went out to Tel
                        Aviv, what were the words of wisdom you were getting first about an
                        assignment to Tel Aviv and then what were you given to expect before you
                        went out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: At that time, the prevailing opinion in the Bureau of Near East and
                    South Asian Affairs in general was that serving in Tel Aviv was not something
                    that would help your career if you wanted to study Arabic and go on and become
                    an Arabist. But during that period you started seeing the development of more
                    and more people who thought it important to serve in both Israel and the Arab
                    world and instead of just an Arabist you had the development of an Arab-Israeli
                    specialist. I replaced Wat Cluverius who was very involved in Arab-Israeli
                    negotiations. I served there with Ned Walker, who is currently NEA Assistant
                    Secretary and also was very involved in Arab-Israeli negotiations. Attitudes
                    were starting to change concerning the old Arabist view of Israel and the
                    problems it caused when I went to Tel Aviv in 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: For a relatively short period of time it was Walworth Barbour, who had
                    been there for many years. His DCM was Owen Zurhellen. Barbour was an
                    institution. He had been in Tel Aviv for 10-12 years, one of the longest-serving
                    American ambassadors anywhere. Neither he nor Owen Zurhellen really had any
                    background on the Arab side. The personnel policy of the State Department had
                    been not to mix the two. You would have Arabists who had never served in Tel
                    Aviv because of the fear that it would taint them and make them unacceptable for
                    assignment to the Arab world, and you had people who would be assigned to Tel
                    Aviv with no experience in the Middle East, which I always thought was a
                    tremendous shortcoming. It seemed to me that for people in the European Bureau,
                    their hardship tour was going to someplace like Tel Aviv. Quite frankly, in
                    general, they brought a real lack of understanding of the issues to Tel Aviv.
                    They tended to be relatively unbalanced in their appreciation. They tended to
                    embrace the Israeli position on issues without taking into consideration the
                    Arab position and the complexities of the two sides.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Late August/early September of 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Israel at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: It was a Labor government led by Golda Meir. Shimon Peres was in the
                    cabinet, a young cabinet minister. Yitzhak Rabin was the Israeli ambassador in
                    Washington. I arrived in Tel Aviv right about the time of the Munich massacre,
                    the seizure by PLO elements of Israeli Olympic athletes at the Munich Olympics
                    and a rescue attempt that went disastrously wrong and led to the death of 12 or
                    so Israeli athletes. Any such terrorist incident really grips Israel. In a way,
                    Israel has been through such trauma because of terrorist incidents that it
                    seemed to me like the nation was many times verging on the edge of hysterical
                    breakdown. It just shows the impact that terrorist incidents have within Israel.
                    I recall taking a tour of the Israel-Lebanon border and listening to the radio
                    of the events in Munich and the death of the Israeli athletes there. It was a
                    very traumatic event for Israelis, as one would expect. To have young athletes
                    going to an event such as the Olympics and being caught up in this kind of
                    violence and then to die a very violent death was something that really affected
                    the Israeli psyche tremendously. I think one thing that gets me about Israeli
                    policand as I look at this today the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians
                    around Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Banis that the Israelis always adopt a
                    policy of retaliation, of trying to make the Arabs pay a terrible price in loss
                    of life and destruction of property. It seems to me that the Israelis have been
                    doing this for 50 years and it has never worked but they can't seem to come up
                    with a better policy whenever there are these kinds of difficulties. What
                    happened after the Munich killings was that the Israelis went into Beirut and
                    assassinated Palestinian leaders. I can't remember the precise timing but they
                    may have destroyed Lebanese aircraft on the ground. This kind of retaliation
                    that the Israelis have traditionally carried out ever since the founding of the
                    state only fuels the cycle of violence between the Israelis and the Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, you were in the political
                        section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the outlook of the political

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: The Munich event certainly cast a pall over things, but one has to
                    recall that when I arrived it was when the War of Attrition was going on between
                    Egypt and Israel along the Suez Canal, the Israelis on their side of the canal
                    behind what was the Bar Lev Line, there being clashes, artillery duels,
                    occasional Israeli bombing raids into Egypt, the introduction of Soviet fighter
                    pilots and so forth. So, there certainly was a degree of tension there, but in
                    many respects for Israelis it seemed kind of far away because it was all taking
                    place on the other side of the Sinai Peninsula. In that sense, the Sinai really
                    did give a buffer to Israel. The casualties were overwhelmingly on the Egyptian
                    side. The Israelis were shooting down aircraft whether they were Egyptian or
                    Soviet piloted without any loss of aircraft on the Israeli side. The soldiers in
                    the Bar Lev Line were pretty well fortified and took very few casualties. So,
                    while there was a lot of tension, it was not as if there were casualties coming
                    back to Israel. Also there was a tremendous feeling of complacency on the
                    Israeli side and on the American side as well. The overwhelming ease of the
                    Israeli victory in the 1967 war made Israelis and American analysts relatively
                    complacent about Israel's military superiority vis-a-vis the Arab states. In a
                    sense it was a little bit like business as usual in terms of dealing with the
                    Arabs.</p>
                <p>There was one event and as I started to get into my job going to Gaza that really
                    struck me. The event was a Libyan airliner that strayed across into the Sinai.
                    It was a Boeing 707 with 90-100 people on it piloted by French pilots. There
                    were several American citizens on the aircraft. The aircraft strayed into the
                    Sinai and Israeli fighters intercepted it. The Israelis had air bases in the
                    Sinai. They tried to get the plane to land. For whatever reason, the pilot did
                    not land. The Israelis strafed the wings, causing the aircraft to crash in the
                    Sinai with the loss of almost all the people on board, including Americans. The
                    thing that struck me about the reaction was that just about every Israeli that I
                    talked to thought it was totally justified shooting down an unarmed civilian
                    airliner. Some people said, “Well, the pilot may have been planning to carry out
                    a suicide mission and ram the aircraft into a populated area in Israel,” which I
                    thought was pretty ridiculous.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The second thing was as I started going down to Gaza; As I talked to Israeli
                    military government officials and Palestinians, I was really struck by the
                    extraordinarily paternalistic attitude of the Israeli military in dealing with
                    Palestinians. There were attitudes that 1) the Palestinians were a pretty wild
                    and uncultured group of people, that Israel was sort of providing a civilizing
                    mission by helping with schools and low cost housing and 2) that the only thing
                    that the Palestinians really understood was force and if the Palestinians didn't
                    behave themselves then Israel was totally justified in using very heavy force to
                    bring them under control. It was shortly before I arrived in Gaza that there had
                    been disturbances in refugee camps, and Ariel Sharon had been put in charge of
                    dealing with this. His solution was to take bulldozers and just go through the
                    middle of refugee camps destroying houses, telling Palestinians they had 30
                    minutes or an hour to pull all of their belongings out and to open up wide
                    swaths of land within the refugee camps that Israeli jeeps could patrol in order
                    to keep the Palestinians under control. This, needless to say, caused tremendous
                    anger and resentment. The way the Israelis dealt with the Palestinians in Gaza
                    and the general Israeli reaction to the shooting down of the Libyan aircraft
                    seemed to me to show almost a racist attitude in dealing with Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard people who have served in both places say that
                        South Africa during the high times of apartheid was not a bad
                        comparison.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: It's an analogy that many people make. I'm a southerner and I
                    experienced and saw racism in the South, in Louisiana and places like that.
                    There seemed to be a real comparison between the racism I saw in the South, how
                    some whites would treat blacks, and what seemed to be the general Israeli
                    attitude toward Palestinians. I recall, I lived in an Israeli neighborhood,
                    Ramat HaSharon. I was the only non-Israeli within in several blocks. It was a
                    source of amusement to Israelis. Most diplomats lived in an area called
                    Herzoli-Tuch, where the diplomats and the wealthy American or Anglo-Israelis
                    lived. My neighborhood was very much a middle class one. Wonderful people. I
                    made a lot of friends. But I was struck how talking to neighbors, they would
                    never consider hiring an Israeli Arab to even work in such things as food
                    processing plants because they viewed that as a security threat. There was such
                    a total divide between Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews, much less Israeli Jews
                    and Palestinians. It was really striking.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, very much. I was dealing a lot with the foreign ministry. I was in
                    Jerusalem a lot talking to people about general Arab-Israeli issues. It was not
                    just Palestinians I was dealing with, but also reporting on broader Israeli-Arab
                    issues as well. I certainly was not delving into Israeli society or Israeli
                    domestic politics.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: In general, there was quite a close relationship. Golda was a very
                    crusty, temperamental person. I go back to what I said earlier. In general, you
                    had people serving in the embassy in Tel Aviv who had no experience at all of
                    dealing with Palestinians or Arabs. At that time, there was a very good
                    Israeli-U.S. bilateral relationship and people in the embassy in general seemed
                    to be very supportive of that relationship. They tended to be quite pro-Israeli
                    and I thought relatively uncritical in the way that they looked at Israeli
                    policies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I would drive down to Gaza and stay in the UN beach club for a night or
                    two. I would set up appointments and go around and meet Palestinian businessmen,
                    some of the leading families in Gaza, ones that were politically active,
                    although political activism at that point was not particularly high on the part
                    of Palestinians. I would set up appointments with the Israeli military
                    government in Gaza. I'd go in and talk to them. I would drive around Gaza,
                    observe Israeli settlement activity, talk to Israeli settlers about what they
                    were doing in terms of building settlements. I talked to UN personnel to try to
                    get a general sense of what was going on. Gaza at that time was a wide open
                    area. There were no fences or anything. The only way you knew you were in Gaza
                    was that there were a couple of 50 gallon drums, the green line between Israeli
                    and Gaza. When you went past the 50 gallon drums, you knew you were in Gaza. At
                    that time, a lot of Israelis would take their cars down to Gaza to be repaired.
                    They would go and shop there because produce and other things were a lot
                    cheaper. You would see a fair number of Israelis down in Gaza. But it was very
                    interesting. I remember staying once at the UN beach club. Palestinians were not
                    allowed on the beach at night because the Israelis would run a truck or a jeep
                    along the beach dragging something behind it that would obliterate all of the
                    footprints. If a Palestinian were caught on the beach at night, the presumption
                    was that this was a terrorist. They would be shot. Someone had walked out of the
                    beach club at night down to the beach and walked back and an Israeli patrol saw
                    the footprints. A detachment of Israeli soldiers surrounded the beach club and
                    basically rousted everyone out to make sure that Palestinians had not
                    infiltrated and come into the beach club. So, it was a mixed atmosphere
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were talking to the Palestinian leaders and the
                        businesspeople, what were you getting from them as far as how they saw the
                        situation there and how they viewed the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: In general, Palestinians were not that politically energized at that
                    point. The PLO was an illegal organization. The PLO in '72 was under attack in
                    Jordan and was on the point of being banished from Jordan. The Israelis were
                    pretty ruthless in clamping down on any political activity that could be
                    interpreted as being pro-PLO. It was illegal to post or show colors that were in
                    the Palestinian flag. For example, if you displayed those colors in some
                    fashion, you would be subject to arrest by Israeli security forces. What the
                    Israelis would allow to operate were relatively quiescent Palestinians who
                    didn't cause any problems. In particular, the Shawa family in Gaza had ties to
                    the Jordanians. I can't remember if he was mayor of Gaza or looked upon as the
                    de factor mayor; El Rachid Shawa, had great cache because he could hand out
                    Jordanian passports to Palestinians that he determined would get them. For a
                    Palestinian who had trouble traveling because he or she had no nationality and
                    no passport, only a UN laissez-passer, having a Jordanian passport was a
                    tremendous advantage. That was a way of currying political favor by the Shawa
                    clan. The Israelis let that go on because in general they favored Jordanian and
                    Palestinian links as opposed to the influence of the PLO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you had this situation where it's not a good idea to
                        have a bunch of people with no particular hope or economic ability to get
                        out and do their thing. When you're repressing people who are not stupid,
                        who have real commercial or political abilities, to keep them barefoot and
                        pregnant, it's a problem. Was this a concern of ours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Not particularly. Policymakers and senior people in the embassy were
                    looking much more at the broader interstate relationshipEgypt-Israel,
                    Syria-Israel, Jordan-Israel. There was relatively little concern about the
                    Palestinians. To the extent that the Palestinians were really factored into
                    things, it was as Jordanian subjects. The attitude of how you dealt with the
                    solution of the Palestinian problem was as part of Jordan. So, at that point,
                    Palestinian nationalism and the concept of a Palestinian state really wasn't on
                    our radar screen and certainly wasn't on the Israeli's radar screen because
                    Golda Meir scoffingly dismissed the notion that there even was a Palestinian
                    people. She said there was no such thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Israeli settlements in Gaza. How was this
                        developing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Generally what happened with settlements both in Gaza and in Golan and
                    I assume to a degree in the West Bank was that the Israeli army would go in and
                    set up an outpost. They had a unit called the Nocho unit, which was an extension
                    of the Zionist movement. They would be young Israelis who would go in and
                    basically build up the infrastructure of the settlement. It would be a military
                    outpost but over time they would build it up and turn it over to one of the
                    Zionist kibbutzim movements. This was taking place in Gaza where there would be
                    an army unit confiscating land, putting up fences, putting up housing, putting
                    up guard posts and so forth, and then developing the infrastructure. Then they
                    would turn it over to some kind of a settlement movement. Civilians would move
                    in and the army would move out. Needless to say, this caused very deep
                    resentment by Palestinians. The Gaza Strip at the time and to this day is
                    certainly one of the two or three most densely populated areas in the world.
                    What the Palestinians saw then was Israelis coming in as soldiers or civilians,
                    fencing off arable land, and dominating the use of water supplies, limiting the
                    Palestinian ability to use the water, and taking away arable land in an area
                    where agriculture was the only thing going.</p>
                <p>Then there would be other Israeli measures that were in place as well.
                    Palestinians could not build a house without an Israeli building permit even if
                    they owned the land. Palestinians could not add an extra story onto their house
                    unless the Israelis agreed to it. This wasn't always strictly enforced, but
                    there certainly were occasions where if someone built an extra story, the
                    Israelis would go in and knock it down. In general, the policy was one of
                    suppression and real domination of the Palestinians. There was no doubt that it
                    created a growing resentment on the part of the Palestinian population towards
                    the Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your reporting? Was there any market for reports
                        on what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Not too much. Frankly, at that point I don't think people really cared
                    about the Palestinians or what was going on. But certainly in terms of the
                    embassy, and this continued throughout the years when I was there, there was a
                    general unwillingness to accept that the Israelis were less than perfect in
                    terms of dealing with Palestinians. I can recall later on tremendous
                    controversies between the American Consulate in Jerusalem and the Embassy in Tel
                    Aviv over the question of whether the Israelis tortured Palestinians. The
                    embassy just flat denied it. Of course, the Israelis denied they were torturing
                    people even though the consulate in Tel Aviv did some fairly credible reporting.
                    Once the U.S. in the '80s started doing human rights reports, it was very clear
                    that there was pretty wide-scale torture and mistreatment of Palestinians by the
                    Israelis to the extent that it was even enshrined in law. There were Israeli
                    policies on how they would torture people, how they would torture Palestinians.
                    But in general, the embassy in Tel Aviv was very closely identified with Israel
                    and with Israeli policies and tended to be pretty uncritical in the way that
                    they reported such policies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself doing the normal work but not
                        getting too disturbed about what you were seeing or were you the odd man
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I was sort of odd man out in dealing with the Palestinians. Most of my
                    colleagues were dealing just with Israelis and they tended to dismiss the
                    mistreatment of Palestinians as either they didn't believe it or they accepted
                    the Israeli line of why it was necessary to do this. In general, there was an
                    uncritical embrace of Israeli positions and not much willingness to look at the
                    other side. One has to keep in mind that Israel then and even now is an
                    incredibly intense place. The Israelis have a circle the wagon mentality. You're
                    either with us or against us. There was a lot of psychological pressure on
                    people to stand with the Israelis. That certainly was the case with the staff
                    and personnel of the American embassy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: No, not at all. I can't recall that that was even a particular issue. I
                    did work in the consular section for a short period of time. I knew people in
                    the consular section. But I can't recall that in the '70s or at least as long as
                    I was there until 1975 the issue of Palestinian-Americans being arrested was a
                    particular issue as far as Embassy Tel Aviv was concerned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Likud was looked upon as a pretty marginal party. I recall meeting
                    Begin, the Likud leader in the Knesset. Prior to the '73 war, Likud was not
                    looked upon as a serious contender to take over the Israeli government. That
                    changed later in the '70s after the '73 war. Up until that point, the Israeli
                    government had been dominated since its founding as a state by the Labor Party
                    in coalition governments with some of the religious parties like the National
                    Religious Party. No one at that point really took very seriously the possibility
                    that Likud might win an election and form a government running Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the religious parties? Did we have much contact
                        with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was a person in the political section who spoke Hebrew who
                    followed domestic politics. Israeli politicians were always quite accessible to
                    people from the American embassy. I recall Ned Walker did the job for a while.
                    He used to see people in the NRP. The focus was on parties in the government and
                    not so much on the parties out of the government. I don't think that there was a
                    lot of attention paid to Likud. There was not much attention paid to the
                    Sephardic element of the Israeli population, which today is extremely important.
                    Back then, the Sephardi were relatively poor. The society politics were totally
                    dominated by Ashkenazis. Although this was a developing issue and problem, it
                    had not assumed very much prominence. I don't think that the political section
                    paid much attention to the Israeli Sephardi.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: It seemed to me that it was not so much an issue. The bigger issue was
                    the Cold War and U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Kissinger was Secretary of State. We were
                    allied with the Israelis while the Soviets were allied with Egypt and Syria. We
                    tended to look at matters much more in a Cold War framework than in terms of a
                    pro-Israeli U.S. policy. That was the intellectual framework that Henry
                    Kissinger laid out while Secretary of State. Of course, this whole dynamic
                    changed with the 1973 war.</p>

                    backwater at that point. Politically, socially and culturally the West Bank and
                    East Jerusalem was much more important. But even so, the Palestinian issue was

                    time and meet with community leaders and Israeli Arab Knesset members, all of
                    whom supported the Labor Party. In general, the Palestinians looked upon
                    Israeli-Arab politicians as people that were going along with the Israeli
                    policies because they had been bought off. There was a lot of discrimination
                    against Israeli-Arabs. They were subject to discriminatory economic policies,
                    discriminatory social and security policies. But they were not politically
                    active or strident and they didn't have that much importance because they were
                    not a critical factor in terms of the Israeli Labor government's being in power.
                    The Labor government through its alliance with religious parties could take or
                    leave Israeli-Arab political support.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: I enjoyed tremendously serving there. It was a fascinating and very
                    dynamic society. There were issues that were very interesting and Israelis were
                    quite accessible. They were much more politically active on the Palestinian
                    side. Frankly, people in the embassy or in Washington were simply not
                    concentrating on the Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza at the time. They
                    were politically disorganized and so much under Israeli domination that they
                    weren't an issue. To the extent that Palestinian nationalism was looked at, it
                    was in the context of Arafat, the PLO, what was taking place in Jordan...</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Right. And then moving on to the Palestinians, moving on to Lebanon,
                    and Arafat setting up his base of operations there. Of course, during that
                    period Palestinian terrorism was starting to develop. I recall having been out
                    at Ben Gurion Airport three or four times when aircraft had been high-jacked
                    there by PLO members. I recall a raft of Palestinian terrorists landed a block
                    from the embassy in Tel Aviv. I had been at the embassy watching a movie and I
                    was driving back towards Jaffa and ran into gunfire between the Fedayeen and
                    Israeli police. These Fedayeen seized a hotel, which as it turned out was a
                    brothel, just a block and a half from the embassy. But Palestinian terrorism was
                    becoming very much a fact of life in Israel during that period.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: In the week before the war, the Israelis were very concerned by
                    military moves that they were seeing on the ground in Egypt and in Syria,
                    particularly in Egypt, and they didn't know what to make of these moves. They
                    asked us for our assessment whether these were just routine fall military
                    exercises that happen when it's much cooler and before the rains start, or
                    whether this really signaled that the Arabs were up to something. On both the
                    Israeli side and the American side both on the political level, the State
                    Department level, the CIA level, we had become complacent about how we looked at
                    the Arabs. We felt that they had been so decisively defeated in 1967 that they
                    would be very foolish to contemplate military action against Israel because
                    Israel could defeat them just as quickly with as few casualties as in '67. And
                    that certainly- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>The day before the war started, it was the day before Yom Kippur. On Yom Kippur
                    the embassy closed down and everyone stayed at home. No one drove or anything.
                    We did one last round of checking. The assessment continued to be that there
                    were some questionable military moves going on but it really didn't signal a
                    move towards hostilities. But there was a lot of uncertainty on the part of our
                    military attaches, on the part of the CIA station at the embassy, on the part of
                    the ambassador and the DCM. The ambassador was Kenneth Keating, the former
                    senator from NY who had been ambassador in India and who had been defeated by
                    Bobby Kennedy in NY. Nick Veliotes was the DCM. So, we all went home on Yom
                    Kippur Eve. Everybody was pretty much housebound for the next 24 hours. Very
                    early in the morning on Yom Kippur, October 6, at about 6:30 or 7:00, this jet
                    flew over my neighborhood at a very low level. It sent shockwaves it was flying
                    so low and slow. I just felt that there was going to be a war starting that day
                    because I knew that the Israelis would not have done that if there had not been
                    something very serious. As I got dressed and went outside, I could see that the
                    reservists were being called up and neighbors whom I knew were coming out of
                    their houses in their uniforms, getting ready to go. I called up the DCM and
                    told him this and he said the same thing was happening in his neighborhood.</p>

                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is December 14, 2000. What do you do when you see the reservists coming
                    up?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: The first thing was that the word went out to all of the people in the
                    embassy that it appeared that hostilities were eminent between Israel and its
                    neighbors. I know that late in the morning Veliotes and Ambassador Keating were
                    called to see Golda Meir at the defense ministry in Tel Aviv. This was during
                    Yom Kippur in which there is no traffic on the roads and cars that were on the
                    roads during that day would be stoned. But this was a very different Yom Kippur
                    for Israelis. Veliotes and Keating went to the defense ministry. Golda Meir
                    informed Keating that Israel had information that it considered to be
                    irrefutable that Egypt and Syria were about to launch military attacks against
                    Israeli forces. Israel had decided that it would not preempt but that it would
                    see what Egypt and Syria would do. Part of the decision not to preempt was that
                    Israel simply wasn't prepared to do so because it had been so confused by
                    deceptive Egyptian and Syrian military moves that it was not in a position
                    militarily to preempt. What was happening on that day was a massive call-up of
                    Israeli reservists. Veliotes called people into the embassy and we went through
                    the process of organizing how we would handle this in terms of reporting. The
                    office of the defense attach� was extremely important in terms of liaising with
                    the Israeli military. But then the political and economic sections were also
                    doing their reporting. The administrative and consular sections had
                    responsibilities for getting the word out to people within the embassy community
                    that hostilities were expected and more broadly to Americans in Israel, for
                    which the consular section was responsible.</p>
                <p>Hostilities started at about 2:00 PM on Yom Kippur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that the Israelis would take care of this
                        as they always had?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I think that opinions were mixed on this. The Israelis were very
                    overconfident. Defense Minister Moshe Dyan that day or shortly thereafter made a
                    very threatening statement that Israel would break the bones of the Egyptians
                    and the Syrians and would really teach them a lesson. There was a great deal of
                    overconfidence on the part of the Israelis in general but also the defense
                    establishment and the intelligence establishment because they did not fully
                    appreciate how the shipment of Soviet arms, particularly surface to air missiles
                    that had much greater capabilities than in 1967 and especially the use of tow
                    missiles by Egyptian soldiers, would change the battlefield. It's an optically
                    guided missile with a shake charge on it that was used against Israeli armor.
                    Israel depended very much for its victory in 1967 first on this air force and
                    then secondly on its armor. The Egyptian and Syrian tactics were to deny Israel
                    air superiority through the use of Soviet surface to air missiles, particularly
                    the SA3 and the SA6, which were effective against low to medium flying aircraft,
                    the Israelis did not lose a single aircraft in the '73 war to air to air combat.
                    But they lost an awful lot of aircraft as a result of these surface to air
                    missiles. They did not have the tactics that were developed later in terms of
                    radar jamming and stuff like that. This was a real shock to them. Unable to have
                    air superiority, it meant that the Egyptian and Syrian militaries were able to
                    advance their armor and it lessened the effectiveness of Israeli armor. Without
                    the combination of air superiority and superiority on the ground with armor, the
                    Israeli advantage was much diluted. In the Sinai, what surprised the Israelis
                    there was not only the use of surface to air missiles but the discipline of the
                    Egyptian soldiers who did not break and run as they did in '67, although if
                    you're being attacked from the air with absolutely no defense, any army would
                    break and run. Their previous experience had set up an attitude on the part of
                    the Israeli military that led them to grossly underestimate the military
                    capabilities of the Egyptians and the Syrians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had that attitude spilled over to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I think it did. In general, embassy people were without area experience
                    or Israeli experience. Many of the people at the embassy generally tended to
                    reflect Israeli perceptions. There was not enough critical questioning of
                    attitudes and so forth. This was not entirely the case. Nick Veliotes was a
                    brilliant person who was much more questioning in terms of Israel and Israeli
                    assumptions. Ambassador Kenneth Keating was in relatively fragile health.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was elderly.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. He had been ambassador in India. His appointment to Israel had
                    been delayed because he had suffered a heart attack. Then he recovered from the
                    heart attack and was nominated and came out to Israel. But he wasn't in the
                    office more than two to three hours a day. His intellectual abilities were much
                    impaired. He was not really into the substance of the issues. He was very
                    pro-Israeli to the point of lacking credibility. Frankly, there was a widespread
                    assumption that he was exactly the kind of ambassador that Henry Kissinger
                    wanted at that time. Kissinger had become Secretary of State. Kissinger really
                    worked the U.S.-Israeli relationship from Washington. The ambassador was Yitzhak
                    Rabin and he was the conduit for information, consultation, request for U.S.
                    military assistance, etc. And the embassy to a large extent was out of it.
                    Certainly Keating was not relied upon in Washington and was not taken seriously
                    in Washington as an astute observer or representative of American interests. In
                    fact, Veliotes told me the story of how Keating, who had been a brigadier
                    general or a major general in World War II, got carried away with this and said
                    he was going to resign as ambassador and offer his services to Golda Meir to
                    fight for Israel. Veliotes had to calm him down. That's an indication of how
                    Keating really was not a serious individual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what did you do? How did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: The first couple of days of the war were a tremendous shock for
                    Israelis. Israel really went into a war footing. There was a blackout at night.
                    You had to put blackout curtains or blankets on your windows and they had
                    wardens who walked around and if there was any light visible, they would knock
                    on your door and tell you either to seal that off or to turn your lights off.
                    The headlights of cars were painted with blue paint which gave out just a very
                    dim light at night. It led to numerous accidents and a lot of casualties.
                    Israeli ammunition trucks were running into each other and blowing up. They
                    turned out the traffic lights, for example. Anyone who drove in Israel during
                    that time knew how hazardous Israeli drivers were. You can imagine what it was
                    like with young soldiers driving at night with no vehicle lights and no traffic
                    lights. There was a tremendous shock to the Israeli body politic within the
                    first week of the war. The Israelis did not crush the Egyptians and Syrians as
                    had been the case in '67. The Israelis were suffering high casualties. They were
                    losing lots of armor. The Egyptians had crossed the Suez Canal. They had seized
                    the Bar Lev Line. They had advanced in the Sinai. They had brought armor and
                    artillery and surface to air missiles over. The Egyptian anti-tank units which
                    would be two to three individuals armed with tow missiles, Sagger missiles, were
                    knocking out lots of Israeli armor. The Israelis came to realize fairly quickly
                    that they were facing a very different situation than in 1967 and a very grave
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: What we tried to do was through conversations and through the press and
                    other things to give a daily sense of what Israeli leaders were saying publicly,
                    what the mood was. There was reporting that was being done in various channels.
                    In 1973 the communications revolution had not taken place. Embassy reporting was
                    much more important in terms of giving a daily feel for what was taking place.
                    You did not have CNN. You did not have instantaneous reporting on the
                    battlefield as you have today. You did not have the kind of communications
                    hookups so that either television or radio was picking up on an almost
                    instantaneous basis what Israeli leaders were saying. So, the military attaches
                    were working 20-24 hours a day around the clock in close contact with their
                    Israeli counterparts. The CIA station which basically had a liaison relationship
                    with the Israelis was in close touch with Mossad for their assessment. The
                    political section was talking to the foreign ministry and reporting on what the
                    politicians were saying, what the mood was, etc. The embassy pretty clearly
                    charted how difficult the situation became for the Israelis within the first few
                    days. The Israelis started running out of certain types of ammunition. They
                    really started panicking because their whole force structure had not been
                    developed to meet this new Egyptian-Syrian threat either to deal with the
                    surface to air missiles, to deal with the Sagger anti-tank missiles, or to deal
                    with the artillery barrages that particularly the Egyptians were putting down.
                    The Israelis were deficient in artillery, particularly 155 millimeter artillery.
                    They were deficient in certain kinds of armor piercing ammunition. Their
                    stockpiles started running out because their planners had planned for a much
                    shorter and less intensive battle. There is a saying that all armies prepare for
                    the last war. That was the case with the Israelis. They prepared for the '67
                    war, not the '73 war, and the '73 war was of much different magnitude than was
                    the case in '67. The Israelis really started panicking and turned to the United
                    States. The request went both through our military attaches but primarily
                    through Ambassador Rabin in Washington to the White House to Kissinger, to the
                    Defense Department, that they needed help. It was at that point that the United
                    States started planning an airlift of essential military supplies to the
                    Israelis using the C5As which had just come on line.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, jet cargo planes, at that time with the largest lift capacity of
                    any aircraft in the world. The airlift was both symbolic in terms of a sign of
                    U.S. commitment and also important in bringing certain parts that the Israelis
                    desperately needed. Even an aircraft that big could not bring the kind of
                    assistance that you need to fight a war simply because there is too much heavy
                    equipment that's needed that you can't airlift. The only way to get that kind of
                    material is by sea. In fact, the United States started shipping stuff by sea,
                    but the turnaround time from when you gathered up the material, sent it to the
                    ports, put it on the ship, and sailed across was probably three weeks. At the
                    rate the fighting was going on, there was no way that the United States could
                    send tanks and other equipmenAPCs, ammunitiofrom the U.S. to Israel and arrive
                    in time to affect the outcome of the battle. What the United State did
                    symbolicalland I can remember sitting at the embassy in Tel Aviwhen the first
                    C5As started arriving, it was in the afternoon. These aircraft approached Israel
                    flying into Ben Gurion Airport over Tel Aviv, these huge aircraft. It was a
                    tremendous morale booster for Israelis. They were really demoralized at the
                    time. For them, it was a very solid sign of American support. To see the
                    aircraft come in on a daily basis really lifted the morale of the State of
                    Israel in a way that can't be calculated. What the planes brought in were
                    specialized parts for aircraft. Israel had many American aircrafF4s and Skyhawk
                    aircraft which were A7s.</p>

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, although the Phantom jet was used both for air superiority and
                    ground support. The Israelis desperately needed certain spare parts that could
                    be flown in with these aircraft. They needed certain kinds of ammunition,
                    particularly armor piercing tank ammunition which came in. The U.S. flew in a
                    few APCs and tanks but that was more of a symbolic gesture. It received a lot of
                    publicity both in Israel and internationally. Of course, there was the
                    international dimension to the support of the United States. Kissinger and Nixon
                    framed this issue in a Cold War-U.S.-Soviet framework. They felt that it was
                    essential that the U.S. stand behind its ally in the region, Israel, while the
                    Soviet Union was supporting Syria and Egypt. So, the symbolism of the U.S.
                    sending APCs and tanks to Israel by air was important as a sign of U.S.
                    commitment, but the impact upon the Israeli military was non-existent. It was
                    during this period? I have to emphasize that the show was really run out of
                    Washington by Kissinger, who worked hard during this period to bring about a
                    cease-fire, a very delicate task because the Egyptians and the Syrians initially
                    resisted a cease-fire because they were advancing. The Israelis wanted one. The
                    tide started to turn first in the Sinai. General Ariel Sharon played a key role
                    in the tank battles that took place down in the Sinai. There was one particular
                    tank battle at a place called the Chinese Farm, so called because there is a
                    Chinese agricultural project there, which was one of the largest tank battles in
                    history. It was a decisive battle from the Israeli point of view. They blunted
                    the Egyptian attack in the Sinai. They moved to secure a foothold on the other
                    side of the Suez Canal. They gradually expanded that foothold and surrounded and
                    put at risk the Egyptian Third Army, a very sizeable force. Having gained
                    control of the battlefield in the Sinai, the Israelis turned their attention to
                    the Golan. In the Golan, the fiercest tank battles took place. It was over a
                    very small territorial unit, which made it even fiercer. The Syrians came very,
                    very close to breaking the Israeli lines and to bringing their tanks down from
                    the Golan Heights into northern Israel and very close to seizing a key bridge
                    across a river down in the Hula Valley, which would have been very devastating
                    for the Israelis if that had taken place. But the ability to control the
                    battlefield in the Sinai allowed the Israelis to shift armor up to the Golan.
                    Israelis also gradually gained air superiority in both the Sinai and the Golan.
                    It allowed the Israelis to hold on to the Golan Heights. But it was a close call
                    for the Israelis in the Golan.</p>

                        which in this case would mean Americans. There were a lot of Israelis who
                        also had American passports. Getting them out of harm's way? What was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Because it was a war, commercial airliners stopped flying into Israel.
                    All the American carriers stopped and so did most of the others. Maybe the only
                    airliner flying in and out of Israel was El-al. A lot of Israelis who had been
                    abroad came back to Israel to fight, to join reserve units. There were
                    volunteers that came to Israel at the time. Dennis Ross, the current Middle East
                    envoy, came to Israel and was there during the '73 war. So was Martin Indyk, our
                    current ambassador to Israel, although at the time he was an Australian, not an
                    American citizen. They were there during the '73 war. Indyk worked in some kind
                    of a food processing plant in '73 because the Israeli males had been called into
                    the reserves. You did not have that many people leaving. Because of the war, we
                    couldn't evacuate any American dependents. So there was no real evacuation of
                    people from Israel. There was just no way to get them out and there was no time
                    to get them out either. I can recall that one Sunday the air raid sirens started
                    sounding in Tel Aviv and we were all instructed to go down to the basement of
                    the building. The Egyptians had been flying some TU16 bombers off the coast of
                    Israel in the Mediterranean and they had launched missiles at Tel Aviv and these
                    missiles were really in essence unmanned MIG15 aircraft which carried a big
                    explosive charge. The Israelis shot them down but the fact of air attacks on Tel
                    Aviv shook people up a lot. From the point of view of protecting American
                    citizens, there was not a lot to do other than try to reassure people, to tell
                    them to obey Israeli blackout instructions and so forth, and to be prepared to
                    leave quickly, to have their possessions, their papers in order, if it was
                    possible to get people out. But there basically was no evacuation during this
                    war.</p>
                <p>I want to point out that the role of the defense attach� office at that time was
                    really critical. In terms of giving assessments, daily briefings, hourly
                    briefings by the Israeli military to our defense attaches, who in turn did their
                    cables and reports? You didn't have the kind of real time satellite intelligence
                    that you have today. Satellite reconnaissance at that time was pretty bulky and
                    was much more difficult to download the stuff. It was through parachuted film
                    canisters.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: So you didn't have real time digital intelligence the way we have
                    today. The defense attaches played a critical role. Fortunately, we had a staff
                    of highly professional officers who did an absolutely superb job during this
                    period.</p>

                        that?</hi>

                <p>ABINGTON: No, not at all. They were looking at it from the other perspective.
                    What you mention is a broader perspective that they simply didn't have. They
                    were looking at it very much from the perspective of what the Israelis were
                    telling them and the desperation that the Israelis were feeling. They didn't
                    have a broader picture.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Nick was really in charge. Keating was the nominal ambassador, but it
                    was Veliotes who was running the whole show. He was working tremendously hard.
                    He was in touch with the foreign minister, the prime minister, the defense
                    minister. He was forwarding proposals and suggestions to Washington, giving
                    assessments. He was pulling it all together and coordinating the whole thing. He
                    was doing this while trying to keep Keating happy and not have Keating go off
                    the deep end either.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was massive mobilization. You'd just see it walking down the
                    street: the absence of men. The people on the street by and large were either
                    elderly men or schoolboys or women. You did not see men. It was difficult in the
                    sense of contacts were gonif they were journalists, they were at the front. Your
                    normal contacts just weren't there.</p>

                        myself, I would have thought that you would have had a bunch of people
                        saying, “You've got to do something” no matter how unrealistic it was to get
                        them out. If they're frightened or annoyed, there is no place better than
                        the embassy to go and shout at officials.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Of course, I wasn't in the consular section. I was in the political
                    section. But my recollection is that there really was not during the conflict a
                    lot of public pressure from people to try to get out. People were listening to
                    radio on an hourly basis. They generally understood what the situation was. They
                    knew that airplanes were not flying in, that getting out was almost impossible.
                    I don't think you had the kind of pressure in 1973 that you had during the
                    1990-1991 Gulf War.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: The difference in '90-'91 was that you had SCUD missiles hitting Tel
                    Aviv and civilian casualties. In the '73 war, I don't think that there were any
                    civilian casualties as a result of Syrian or Egyptian military strikes. You also
                    had the threat of chemical warheads in '90-'91 and that created a tremendous
                    amount of panic and concern on the part of the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After a cease-fire came into existence, what were we
                        seeing in Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: One has to recall that the cease-fire came about as a result of
                    Kissinger's negotiations with the Soviets. Kissinger went to Moscow and worked
                    out the details of a cease-fire acceptable to both sides and a Security Council
                    resolution, 338, which called for a cease-fire and for a political settlement.
                    The Israelis' feeling was mixed. On the one hand, they had really been bloodied
                    very badly with very serious casualties, the worst since 1948 when Israel became
                    independent, the worst casualties of any conflict, and they had been badly
                    damaged by the Egyptians and the Syrians both in terms of people killed and
                    wounded as well as equipment destroyed. On the other hand, I think that the
                    Israelis at this point had really put the Egyptians under tremendous pressure.
                    Some elements of the IDF and the political establishment thought that Israel
                    should continue fighting against Egypt to destroy the Egyptian Third Army and to
                    push the Egyptians out of the Bar Lev Line and out of the Sinai. But then this
                    became wrapped up in power politics and in Cold War politics. The Soviet Union
                    made it clear that an Israeli military move against Egyptian forces along the
                    lines I just described would meet some unspecified Soviet response. This led to
                    a tremendous amount of international tension. It caused President Nixon to
                    increase the overall readiness of U.S. military forces around the world to a
                    much higher stage. And it raised concern that the conflict, particularly the
                    Egyptian-Israeli conflict, could lead to U.S.-Soviet military involvement. As a
                    result, the stakes increased tremendously. Because of that, Kissinger and Nixon
                    made it quite clear to the Israeli leadership that there had to be a cease-fire.
                    There were assurances from Kissinger that the U.S. would be very mindful of
                    Israeli security requirements and concerns. I think that that had been clearly
                    demonstrated by the support both political and military that the U.S. had given
                    Israel with the outbreak of the conflict. There was a clear commitment that
                    there would be additional U.S. military assistance to Israel and there would be
                    an expedited resupply of military equipment to make up for the losses that the
                    Israelis had suffered. So, Israel accepted the cease-fire somewhat but not too
                    reluctantly. Kissinger flew from Moscow to Tel Aviv and it was a six to
                    eight-hour stop to brief the Israelis. Then he went on to Cairo to meet with
                    President Sadat and to brief him as well. That was the 22nd or 23rd of October.
                    The fighting stopped, although there were sporadic outbreaks, particularly in
                    the Sinai or in Egypt proper across the canal, where there continued to be
                    periodic low level fighting. The Egyptian Third Army, which at that point had
                    been totally surrounded? The Israelis kept up their military pressure and this
                    continued to be a real flashpoint. The United States had to work out resupply
                    arrangements and put some serious pressure on the Israelis to allow food and
                    fuel and so forth to go to the Egyptian Third Army. Sadat was absolutely
                    concerned that the Israelis would try to destroy the Third Army. He was
                    appealing for Soviet and American help to keep that from happening. Kissinger
                    and others realized the seriousness of that situation and pressed Israel very
                    hard not to take further action against the Third Army.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Not really. We didn't spend any time at all? Of course, the consulate
                    in Jerusalem had responsibility for reporting on what Palestinians in the West
                    Bank were doing. But we essentially did nothing with regard to the Israeli Arabs
                    or for that matter Palestinians in Gaza. I think that the main reason was that
                    unlike in the Gulf War and unlike today, Palestinians were not politically
                    mobilized and were not politically active in 1973. They were quiescent and the
                    Israelis had the situation under control militarily with regard to the West Bank
                    and Gaza. I don't recall that there were any particular incidents caused by
                    Palestinians nor were there Israeli measures like 24-hour curfews as they did
                    during the Gulf War. The Palestinians were not a factor in the '73 war.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. There was a feeling on the part of Israelis that the United States
                    had played a critical role in standing by Israel during its most difficult hour
                    since independence. There was a sense of real gratitude on a popular level and
                    among the political leadership. On the other hand, Golda Meir was still the
                    prime minister. You had people in the cabinet who were determined that they were
                    going to do it their way. Kissinger was finding the Israelis difficult to deal
                    with, as they usually are because they are very fierce in terms of protecting
                    their own interests. There was a cease-fire but then there was a very intensive
                    period of negotiation to stabilize the situation. Those were the negotiations in
                    November and December which led to the two agreements. The first was the
                    Kilometer 101 Agreement. Then there was the First Disengagement Agreement.
                    Kissinger started and the phrase was coined “shuttle diplomacy” between Israel
                    and Egypt in November and December to try to stabilize the situation to remove
                    this flashpoint of the Israeli siege of the Egyptian Third Army. That led to the
                    Kilometer 101 Agreement.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: Fairly intensive discussions were going on between Kissinger and Rabin
                    here in Washington. The embassy was receiving instructions from Washington to
                    talk to the foreign ministry or to the prime minister. Keating and Veliotes
                    would do that. For example, there were warnings about military action against
                    the Third Army. There was consultation primarily led by Veliotes to talk to
                    senior Israeli leaders to get their sense of their mood, of their plans, etc. In
                    that sense, it was still a crisis atmosphere. The embassy was doing its best to
                    assess Israeli plans and intentions regarding the aftermath of the war and how
                    to deal with it. There was also a congressional visit, a large one led by
                    Congressman Mel Pryce and 40-45 members of Congress who came out shortly after
                    the cease-fire. Congressman Pryce was chairman of the House Armed Services
                    Committee. There were also representatives from the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee. The Israelis then as now realized the importance of congressional
                    support for Israel. They worked really hard to take care of this delegation. I
                    was the control officer along with one of the military attaches. It was quite
                    dramatic because this probably would have been early November and the Israelis
                    flew us by helicopter out to the Sinai along the Suez Canal. We saw the area of
                    the Chinese Farm where this huge battle had taken place and you literally could
                    see hundreds of destroyed and damaged tanks and APCs in this area. We flew over
                    the Suez Canal and went to Egypt to the Israeli forward positions where they had
                    surrounded the Egyptian Third Army. We received a briefing from the IDF on the
                    Egyptian side of the canal. I'll never forget, there were Egyptian soldiers'
                    bodies still unburied. It was very much a war zone. It made a tremendous impact
                    on the members of the congressional delegation and on me. We were the first
                    visitors of a non-military nature to that area. The Israelis really played up
                    what had happened, the threat, etc. It had the desired impact. The delegation
                    went back to Washington and were very strongly behind a significant U.S.
                    military assistance package to Israel. That was a very important event. It
                    cemented congressional support for the Israelis. The Israelis received them at
                    the highest level. They had briefings by the prime minister, the foreign
                    minister, the IDF chief of staff and general command, and they saw for
                    themselves the battlefield which made a very deep impression on these
                    congressmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this early cease-fire period, were you picking up a
                        certain disquiet on the part of elements within Israel of the leadership of
                        Golda Meir?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Very much so, yes. The Israeli press traditionally has been vociferous
                    in its criticism. There was a feeling that the Israeli political and military
                    leadership had failed the country by not anticipating the attacks and by
                    misreading the intelligence and by a miss-assessment of Egyptian and Syrian
                    political and military intentions. There was a committee formed, the Argonaut
                    Committee, headed by the chief justice of Israel, which did a very thorough
                    review of the situation and essentially blamed the leadership for its failure.
                    That led in early 1974 to Golda Meir's resignation. Yitzhak Rabin then became
                    the prime minister. During that period— November, December, January—ongoing
                    negotiations continued, which had to be done by Kissinger and his Middle East
                    team that included Joe Sisco, who at the time had become US for Political
                    Affairs, Roy Atherton, who was the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and
                    South Asian Affairs, Hal Saunders, who was the deputy; he had moved over from
                    the NSC to assist Roy Atherton with responsibility for the Arab-Israeli issue,
                    and Bill Klunt had replaced him at the NSC. So, you had some real heavy hitters.
                    Kissinger had a superb team of diplomats and negotiators with him, although he
                    really ran the show. But it was personal hands-on diplomacy by Kissinger
                    negotiating between the Egyptians and the Israelis to bring about the Kilometer
                    101 Agreement, which stabilized the situation and led to the Israeli evacuation
                    of positions across the canal, and then later the First Disengagement Agreement
                    which led to a zone of separation between Israel and Egypt. During that period,
                    the embassy was totally involved in supporting Kissinger. Essentially the
                    embassy moved up to Jerusalem to the King David Hotel and we were there in a
                    staff and administrative support capacity, although Veliotes was involved,
                    Keating was really no more than the symbolic presence. It was really a
                    negotiation totally run by Henry Kissinger and by his staff in Washington. The
                    embassy played very little substantive role in this process. It essentially was
                    there to support Kissinger's efforts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I left Israel in June of 1975. During that period, the negotiation by
                    Kissinger was intensive. To my way of thinking, the '73 war and Kissinger's
                    diplomacy afterwards laid the foundation for American diplomacy to try to
                    resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute. I look upon the peace process and building
                    blocks. Every agreement is based upon prior agreements. Kissinger really set
                    that in motion. During the time that I was there in Tel Aviv, there was the
                    Kilometer 101 Agreement, there was the First Disengagement Agreement, there was
                    the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement, where Kissinger spent something
                    like 33 days at the King David Hotel shuttling back and forth between Damascus
                    and Jerusalem to negotiate that agreement. Then there was the attempt to reach a
                    second disengagement agreement which failed in March of 1975. I remember being
                    at the airport and Kissinger saying that he was going back for a reassessment of
                    American policy which was widely perceived in Israel and in Washington as a
                    threat to bring pressure against Israel, feeling that Israel was being
                    recalcitrant in terms of a further pullback in the Sinai. Of course, the
                    Israelis mounted a very effective congressional campaign which culminated in a
                    letter to the President by something like 90-92 of the 100 senators saying that
                    the United States should not put pressure on Israel. That whole reassessment
                    threat pretty much went out the window. But it was a period of very creative
                    diplomacy by Kissinger and deep personal involvement on the Arab-Israeli issue
                    and really laid the groundwork for future U.S. efforts to mediate the
                    Arab-Israeli dispute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the attributes of Israeli action that I've picked
                        up is that they would sign an agreement and then keep challenging it. In
                        other words, an agreement is sort of a preliminary thing and they keep
                        pushing ahead a little. Were we noticing that, trying to get everything they
                        could out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: I've always felt that a style of Israeli negotiators is to stake out an
                    absolutely unreasonable and maximalist position and to negotiate back from
                    there. In general, Israelis are reasonably successful in that because they end
                    up getting more than might otherwise be the case. This tends to be a tactic
                    whether it's negotiating with Arab neighbors or with the Palestinians or whether
                    it's negotiating with the United States issues in the bilateral relationship
                    like strategic cooperation, etc. It's a characteristic of negotiations, to
                    overreach, to put really maximalist positions on the table, and they end up
                    getting instead of 70% maybe 90-95%. I helped do the staff work for Kissinger
                    when he was negotiating these agreements, working with the Executive
                    Secretariat. I saw the negotiating papers and so forth. I saw the agreements as
                    they went through drafts. Then when I came back to Washington in the summer of
                    '75, I was a staff aide to Roy Atherton. I did a lot of the staff work in
                    preparation for negotiations that Kissinger carried out. He kept it to a very
                    small circle of people and someone needed to do the staff work and it fell to me
                    as Roy's staff aide. To go back to your question, once an agreement was reached
                    between Israel and Syria, between Israel and Egypt, and once the military
                    movements took place, Israel was pretty good about living up to the agreements.
                    Once the Israelis pulled back to new lines in Sinai, they basically respected
                    those. In the Golan Heights, when Israel withdrew from Kuneitra, quite clearly
                    the Israelis destroyed Kuneitra before they withdrew. It was widely seen as an
                    act of bad faith. Then the Israelis charged that the Syrians were not interested
                    in peace because otherwise they would have rebuilt Kuneitra even though it was
                    surrounded by the Israelis. It's still surrounded by the Israelis 26 years after
                    the disengagement agreement. It angered the Syrians very much. The Israelis
                    charged that the buildings had been damaged or destroyed during fighting. In
                    fact, we went up and examined the area, and it was clear that the Israelis had
                    put charges in the buildings and collapsed them, blown out the walls so that the
                    roofs caved in. That was not caused by fighting during the war but caused by an
                    act of Israeli retaliation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can tell. I was in Bosnia after the civil war and you
                        can tell when houses are destroyed by military action.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. It was quite clear that Israel had destroyed much of the city of
                    Kuneitra. This has been a hallmark of the way Israel negotiates agreements with
                    its neighbors. They are niggardly in the negotiations. There is no good grace on
                    the part of the Israelis when they carry out these agreements. That was the case
                    with the disengagement agreement. There was no good grace in terms of Kuneitra.
                    They destroyed the city and poisoned the atmosphere, which was bad to begin
                    with. It certainly didn't set a proper framework for a future developing
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>It was the same thing when they carried out the peace agreement with Egypt.
                    Rather than just withdraw from Israeli settlements in the Sinai, which clearly
                    were illegal, the Israelis evacuated the settlements with difficulty, but then
                    they flattened and destroyed the settlements. It was widely seen in the Arab
                    world as a general attitude of Israel towards Arabs. Of course, they held on to
                    the Taba area for years when clearly there was no legal basis for their having
                    it. It's these kind of gestures on the part of Israel that goes a long way to
                    poisoning the atmosphere between Israel and its neighbors. It's always an irony
                    that when Israel talks about a cold peace, it always fails to acknowledge
                    actions that it has taken that have contributed to the cold peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense any change in the attitude towards Syria or
                        Egypt or towards Arabs in general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Certainly not up to the point that I left in 1975. There was a visceral
                    hatred or dislike of, particularly, the Syrians. There was a feeling that the
                    Syrians were the most brutal of all the Arabs. I suppose that one reason was
                    that the Syrians and the Israelis geographically were cheek by jowl unlike the
                    Egyptians and the Israelis where you had the Sinai as a buffer. In that sense,
                    having that kind of buffer meant that the hatred or the mistrust on the part of
                    Israelis was much less. I think that in general among Israelis that I talked to,
                    average Israelis, there was a general contempt and mistrust with regard to Arabs
                    in general, a visceral dislike of the Syrians, almost bordering on hatred, a
                    deep distrust of Palestinians. This was reinforced by terrorist incidents, for
                    example, the Ma'alot incident in '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Some Palestinians came across the Israeli-Lebanese border. They seized
                    a school in the town of Ma'alot in northern Israel. Israelis stormed the school
                    and in the resulting fighting something like 20 Israeli schoolchildren were
                    killed. Of course, that made a tremendous impact on Israelis. It happened when
                    Kissinger was in Jerusalem and it totally disrupted the negotiations. There was
                    an intense Israeli focus on this from the political leadership on down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense a change in our embassy towards the
                        leadership of Sadat? Was he a different person than had been felt before? We
                        were thinking of Sadat as being not a very impressive replacement for
                        Nasser.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: It changed as a result of the '73 war. It started to gradually change
                    as Kissinger became convinced that Sadat was a genuinely different kind of Arab
                    leader and that Sadat genuinely wanted to make peace. I can recall that Israelis
                    were traumatized by the '73 war. To a degree they had blinders on because of
                    their stereotypical attitudes towards Arabs that exist today. Of course, one
                    fallout from the '73 war and the Israeli intelligence failure, military failure,
                    and political failure was that it changed the psychology of the way that the
                    military, the intelligence communities assessed Arab attitudes. They went very
                    much from an arrogant feeling of Israel being so much stronger than the Arabs to
                    really worst case assessments of Arab intentions. This worst case assessment led
                    them to question and discount signs of a different Arab attitude towards peace
                    with Israel. Certainly that was the case with Syria and Egypt. They listened to
                    what Kissinger was saying, that this was a new ballgame and new opportunities
                    were there. They had been burned so badly by the '73 war that they were very
                    skeptical about what they were told by the Americans and they had a real
                    difficulty in coming up with honest and accurate intelligence assessments of
                    particularly Egyptian intentions. There was no Israeli interests section or
                    embassy in Cairo. They had a very hard time gathering information. I've always
                    felt that Israel suffers and continues to suffer in terms of its understanding
                    of Arabs and its assessment of Arab intentions. That's been the case in the 30
                    years that I dealt with Israel and Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep using the term “Arab.” Was there the feeling that
                        the Egyptians aren't really Arabs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Oh, yes. I'm using “Arab” in a broad sense without distinguishing
                    between Jordanians, Syrians, Iraqis, Egyptians. There was certainly the growing
                    perception in the embassy that the Egyptians were quite different. We could see
                    signs of falling out between the Egyptians and the Syrians over how Sadat was
                    pursuing his policy. The Syrians were angry that the unity of the war after the
                    conflict ended, that the Egyptians began pursuing their own interests in terms
                    of negotiations with Israel using the United States. You could see developing
                    Syrian-Egyptian strains. King Hussein at the time had stayed out of the '73 war.
                    There were continuing secret Israeli-Jordanian contacts and dialogue going on
                    with Hussein and the Israeli prime minister at the intelligence level. In '73
                    and '74, the PLO had been kicked out of Jordan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Black September.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes. They had relocated in Lebanon, which was becoming increasingly
                    unstable in the mid-'70s. In late '75/'76, Lebanon became a real hotspot. I
                    think that there was a perception in the embassy that Egypt was playing a
                    different role and the U.S. leadership - Kissinger, Nixon, and then Forwere
                    looking at Egypt in a much different light.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here is the embassy. You've been through a very dramatic
                        war. Did you find that all of you coming out of that were much more
                        pro-Israeli? I'm talking about real localitis coming out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: No. I think there were different opinions. To be perfectly honest, I
                    felt from the time I arrived in Israel in 1972 that Israel was essentially
                    racist in the way that it treated Palestinians. I was new to the Foreign
                    Service, but just from the point of view of seeing how Israel dealt with its
                    Arab neighbors, I felt that Israeli policies were misguided, not very well
                    thought out, that the Israeli prejudices against the Arabs were so deep and so
                    strong that Israeli actions were fueling the crisis. Certainly one can fault
                    what the Palestinians were doing, can fault what the Syrians were doing, a lack
                    of recognition or understanding of what the Egyptians were up to, but Israeli
                    actions created a lot of the difficulties in the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is
                    a conflict between two parties. When you're part of that and when you're
                    emotionally bound up in it, it's very difficult to distance yourself and take an
                    honest look. I think that it's the role of outside mediators like the U.S. to
                    rise above the positions of one side or the other and try to bring them
                    together. We've done not so good and fairly good jobs of that at different
                    times. We can talk about when we didn't do a very good job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come to that. We'll pick this up in 1975 when you're
                        going back to Washington.</hi>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is June 8, 2001. This was 1975. How did you get the job?</p>
                <p>ABINGTON: The assistant to Roy Atherton had been Ed Walker, with whom I had
                    served in Tel Aviv for one year and then went back and worked for Roy and then
                    later became Assistant Secretary for the Near East Bureau. Ed Walker recommended
                    to Roy that I replace him. I came back in the summer of 1975 and started working
                    for Roy as a staff aide. In those days, the way that Henry Kissinger ran the
                    Middle East negotiations basically there was a very small group of people around
                    Kissinger, including Joe Sisco, Roy Atherton, Hal Saunders, Pete Day, Bob Oakley
                    over at the NSC. Kissinger relied on those people. He tried to keep the
                    negotiations very tightly compartmented. In essence, I became sort of a staff
                    person for the peace process particularly doing special projects for Atherton
                    and Hal Saunders. When I came back, it was shortly after Kissinger's efforts in
                    April of '75 to negotiate a second Sinai withdrawal agreement had failed and
                    Kissinger had threatened a reassessment of U.S. policy which the Israeli lobby
                    and Israel quickly scuttled. That reassessment was dead in the water. Kissinger
                    redoubled his efforts with President Sadat and with then Prime Minister Rabin to
                    try to work out a second Sinai agreement. During that period when I came back,
                    it was a very intensive period of preparation of maps and discussions in
                    Washington with the Israelis by Kissinger and then culminating in another
                    shuttle out to the region and eventually a second agreement which had the
                    Israelis withdraw much further into the Sinai. It set the stage later on for the
                    Camp David negotiations in the Carter administration of 1978.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Roy really gave a lot of authority to the staff aides and it was an
                    enormously demanding job. I did it for two years, an incredibly long period of
                    time. We would either come in at 6:30 or 7:00 AM and stay until 4:00 or 5:00 PM
                    or we'd come in around 9:00 AM and stay until 9:00 or 10:00 PM and work every
                    other weekend. There were so many things going on during that period. Not only
                    were there the Israeli-Arab negotiations on the peace process that Kissinger was
                    conducting, but there were things like the crisis in Lebanon, the assassination
                    of Frank Meloy, the ambassador there. Not too long after I arrived in the summer
                    of 1975, the fighting between Lebanese and Palestinians became more and more
                    intense. Towards the end of the summer/early fall, there was the evacuation of
                    the FSI language school in Beirut and relocation of the school to Tunis. There
                    was the drawdown of personnel at the embassy in Lebanon. I acted as Roy's
                    factotum in terms of keeping track of what was going on, deciding what he needed
                    to be alerted on and what he needed to work on. I worked with Pete Day and then
                    later Hal Saunders very closely on these issues. There was just an enormous
                    amount of paper that was prepared particularly for the first year of the Middle
                    East negotiations. I was responsible for compiling the written history of these
                    negotiations. Every time Kissinger would go anywhere, to China or to Europe, he
                    would always take someone with hiRoy Atherton or Sisco or Hal Saunderto staff
                    him on the Middle East. It always takes someone very senior to staff him on the
                    Middle East. We used to have these incredible number of suitcases which
                    contained all the documentation, all of the previously negotiated agreements,
                    not only the text of the agreements but all the side documents, the side letters
                    of understanding, memoranda of agreement and so forth. Not only that, I would
                    compile three- ring binders of all the conversations that Kissinger had and our
                    ambassadors in the region had and cables that acted as backup. I can remember
                    when Roy or Sisco would travel, they might have 20-25 of these bags of
                    documents. It was just the way Kissinger did business. He wanted the
                    documentation there that he could refer to. The people traveling with him wanted
                    the documentation. It was an incredible job to try to keep up with all of this
                    material plus all of the other things that the NE Bureau was dealing with. In
                    terms of managing the paper flow, of building this library of documents on the
                    peace process, it was a very intensive job with lots and lots of long hours. I
                    probably saw more of Roy Atherton during that two- year period than any other
                    person in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think one of the problems with this documentation
                        is that Henry Kissinger had the reputation of going in on a one-on-one
                        conversation, excluding other people. One was always concerned about
                        promises made and all that. Was this true?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Kissinger generally debriefed people after he had these meetings. Being
                    a political scientist/historian, he was definitely looking to the future when he
                    was no longer Secretary of State and would be writing about that period, a very
                    dynamic period in American foreign policy. He would generally debrief people,
                    such as Peter Rodman or other people would make notes of his meetings and then
                    write them up. It was the same with telephone calls. At that point, whenever
                    Henry Kissinger had a telephone conversation with a foreign official, generally
                    there would be three or four people listening in on the line. The person on the
                    other end was never told that anyone was listening in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was common practice throughout the State Department,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, very much so. The practice changed later on when privacy concerns
                    became more to the front. But during these phone conversations, Kissinger would
                    insist on a verbatim memorandum of conversation. You usually had a secretary
                    listening to the conversation, recording it in shorthand, and then the
                    memorandum of conversation would be typed up and given very limited
                    distribution. Kissinger wanted them immediately. That became the top priority of
                    whoever was listening in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, many of these things staff assistants at
                        the State Department at the upper levels would be taking notes of things to
                        do so that the principal person talking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: In all the years I spent at the State Department, I felt that the State
                    Department performed at the highest peak when Kissinger was Secretary of State.
                    He demanded a lot from the State Department staff. He didn't tolerate sloppy
                    work and he would be brutal if you sent a memorandum to him that was not well
                    thought out and succinche would come back with very acerbic comments. I was a
                    task master for the NEA bureau. I would read memorandum and would rather rudely
                    edit them myself and send them back to the drafters, which most staff aides
                    didn't have that kind of authority, but Atherton wanted me to do it because he
                    felt that Kissinger looked very carefully at things coming out of the NEA bureau
                    and he wanted good work to go upstairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The way the Department worked during that period also was that Kissinger and
                    Sisco wanted to bypass the system and the bureaucracy altogether. The number of
                    memoranda going to Kissinger that were “out of the system” was very high. What
                    that meant was that Kissinger, when he wanted something, he wanted it five
                    minutes ago. Or he considered it to be very sensitive and he felt that he didn't
                    want the line officers and the staff secretariat going over the memos or he
                    didn't want to take the time to have them staffed. With the Near East Bureau, it
                    was a very unique relationship with Kissinger's office and with US for Political
                    Affairs Joe Sisco. Many of the memos that we did on the peace process would go
                    directly to Sisco, who would walk them into Kissinger, or would go directly to
                    Kissinger and they wouldn't even be put in the system. Eventually copies of the
                    memoranda made their way into the archives of the State Department, but there
                    was an awful lot of material that did not go through the formal system through
                    the staff secretariat on the problems facing the Middle East Bureau, it looks
                    like it was divided up into the peace process, which is essentially Egypt and
                    Israel, and then the Lebanese thing with the Palestinians. The Palestinians were
                    part of the Lebanese problem as opposed to the Israeli problem at that time. Am
                    I wrong?</p>
                <p>During the Kissinger negotiations, we tried to get at the Palestinian problem
                    through negotiation with Jordan. We started talking about things like functional
                    autonomy for the Palestinians. In other words, they would run civic affairs but
                    the Israelis would still be occupying the area but with less of a direct control
                    over the daily life of Palestinians. There were some attempts to try to get
                    those negotiations off the ground between Jordan and Israel but the issues were
                    complex, very difficult, and quickly fell to the wayside as Kissinger really
                    concentrated on things like the Syrian-Israeli disengagement agreement or the
                    Egyptian-Israeli negotiation or when the crisis in Lebanon became increasingly
                    serious in '75/'76. We tried to deal with the Lebanon crisis in a way to keep
                    Syria and Israel from being sucked into a war over Lebanon. The Palestinian
                    issue was really secondary and to the extent that it was addressed, particularly
                    in late '75/'76, it was a function of the increasingly serious fighting in
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the question of Israeli settlements in the West Bank
                        come up then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, it was an issue. Of course, it was a Labor government. The defense
                    minister and later foreign minister, Yigal Allon, put forward a plan to
                    establish Israeli settlements in areas that were considered important for
                    Israel's security, the Jordan Valley and the West Bank ridge line that would be
                    to the west of the Jordan Valley. He established a string of settlements and
                    built north-south highways in that area. The Arabs protested this and would take
                    it to the UN. At the time, the United States took a pretty firm line in the
                    Security Council against Israeli settlements and generally voted for resolutions
                    that condemned the settlements and called on Israel to cease seizing land and
                    building settlements and transferring population into Palestinian areas. That
                    included in East Jerusalem as well. But while the settlement issue was a subject
                    of dialogue with Israel it never became the central issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>One has to keep in mind that at the time we were talking not only about
                    settlements in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, but also there was a
                    very active building of settlements up in the Golan Heights. The Israelis
                    basically razed the Syrian villages that were up there, bulldozed the villages,
                    bulldozed the walls marking off Syrian fields and so forth, and created an
                    uninterrupted area up in the Golan Heights that was open to Israeli settlements.
                    But more importantly from the point of view of Kissinger at the time were
                    Israeli settlement activity in the Sinai. Kissinger even before Camp David
                    understood that an Egyptian-Israeli peace had to entail full Israeli withdrawal
                    from Sinai and that meant that Israel would have to give up all of the
                    settlements that it had been establishing since 1967 in the Sinai. So, the
                    settlement issue was an important issue and it had a lot of different
                    ramifications, but probably the focus in '75/'76 was thinking about how
                    settlements affected the ongoing Israeli-Egyptian negotiating process, and it
                    was less of a focus on the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Gaza, although that was
                    important within an inter-Arab context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were watching this, did you get any feel about the
                        difference in negotiating style or outlook between the Egyptians and the
                        Israelis and then also with the Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Negotiations with the Syrians in terms of Israeli-Syrian negotiations
                    pretty much petered out after the 1974 disengagement agreement on the Golan
                    Heights. Increasingly that process in terms of trying to consider or try to work
                    towards an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement was overtaken by the mounting crisis
                    in Lebanon. Syria was faced with a situation of enormous complexity which
                    threatened to suck Syria and Israel into an all-out war. U.S. efforts at the
                    time were focused on trying to reach a series of understandings, informal
                    understandings, of red lines between Syria and Israel so that each understood
                    what each party could or could not do in Lebanon. Those red lines were designed
                    to keep Israel and Syria from going to war over Lebanon. In terms of negotiating
                    style between Israel and Egypt, President Sadat had a very clear vision of where
                    he wanted to go and he was less interested in the actual details of negotiation
                    than getting to the end result. The Israelis on the other hanand I've seen this
                    throughouthey did it with the Lebanese in 1982, they might concede certain broad
                    principles but then the Israelis would win back whatever concessions they've
                    made through nickeling and diming every single detail. The Israeli negotiating
                    style with the Arabs is such that they focus on the details so much, they take
                    away the good feeling that comes from an agreement by making their negotiating
                    partner feel that there is no such thing as a goodwill gesture on the part of
                    the Israelis. They insist on nailing down all of their concerns in writing and
                    the Israeli style is very much to look at the details, to have lawyers draft the
                    details, and the Arabs by comparison the way they negotiate, I think that they
                    were at a disadvantage in drafting the text of agreements. The net effect of
                    these agreements was that the Arabs felt that the Israelis got too much and
                    instead of becoming a win-win situation people who negotiated with the Israelis
                    have a pretty bitter taste in their mouth at the end of the process. Whatever
                    goodwill was there tended to be dissipated as the difficulties of implementing
                    the agreements became apparent.</p>

                        Euphrates, Syria, Iraq, the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and then beyond,
                        Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and all. Did that get pretty short shrift in
                        those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Very much so. Roy Atherton spent hardly any time at all on South Asian
                    issues or for that matter even looking at the Gulf, at Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan.
                    That was backwater of the Near East and South Asia Bureau. At the time, you had
                    a Deputy Assistant Secretary for South Asia. That person had a tremendous amount
                    of latitude in terms of dealing with those issues and would spend most of his
                    time dealing with South Asia and Iran. At the time, Sid Sober was the PDAS in
                    NEA. He had a South Asian background. Between him and the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, Howie Schaffer, you had a pretty strong team who were dealing with
                    South Asia. The people in the Near East Bureau were just going flat out all the
                    time. There were all these task forces going on whether it was over terrorism,
                    hijackings, or the civil war in Lebanon, or the crisis in South Asia which led
                    to an Indo-Pakistani War, and Kissinger's preoccupation with Israeli-Arab
                    negotiations on the peace process. It was a time when I wonder how the NEA
                    bureau managed to stay on top of everything. There were so many crises going on
                    all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One had the feeling that Iran, being the Shah, was taken
                        care ogive him what he wants and we'll get some money back from him. And
                        with India it was sort of back of the hand. The relationship with the Indian
                        leader was very poor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: That's true. In Pakistan, the Pakistanis acted as the facilitator for
                    Kissinger's famous secret trip to China. He went to China from Pakistan. He
                    ostensibly was on a visit there. But as I look back during that period,
                    certainly the Israeli-Arab negotiations seemed to be the top priority, but then
                    they would get pushed aside as crises arose like Lebanon or India-Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Lebanese thing, you had a tribal conflict within
                        Lebanon itself. Was there much we could do about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: The actual fighting there was relatively little. Our embassy in West
                    Beirut was in the middle of a free fire zone. We had drawn down to a relatively
                    few number of people. The fighting was so intense that no one could get out and
                    go talk, particularly to the Christian side. During that period in early '76,
                    Frank Meloy, the ambassador, and the economic counselor had gone out to try to
                    go into East Beirut to try to meet with the Christians. They disappeared and the
                    embassy called in and said they were missing. There was a period of time?
                    Everyone was deeply concerned. I informed Roy Atherton and he in turn informed
                    the Secretary. Then I got a telephone call from the Operations Center that said
                    that the bodies of Meloy and Waring and the Lebanese driver, Magrabi, had been
                    found. I went in and informed Roy. Of course, Roy was just devastated by the
                    news. It was a real crisis in terms of trying to deal with the parties in
                    Lebanon. We had no one who could get out and talk to them. Particularly after
                    Meloy's assassination, the embassy basically was in a bunker. People were living
                    in the embassy. They were raiding the commissary for their food. There were
                    artillery duels back and forth outside and it was just an incredibly dangerous
                    situation. It was at that point that Kissinger decided that we needed to send
                    someone into East Beirut to talk to the Christians and figure out what they were
                    up to. Initially, he picked Ed Djerejian to do this, or rather Ed volunteered to
                    do it. Ed spoke fluent Arabic, excellent French. He is an Armenian-American and
                    spoke Armenian. At the time, Ed was the U.S. Consul General in Bordeaux or
                    Marseilles. He joined up with Kissinger on one of Kissinger's trips to Europe
                    and flew back. I believe Roy was on the flight or Joe Sisco. Djerejian talked
                    with Kissinger and mapped out what they were going to do, what he was going to
                    do. They came back to Washington. Djerejian held briefings, met with a number of
                    people, had his instructions. I remember helping him be fitted for a bulletproof
                    vest. I went and got something like $20-25,000 in hundred dollar bills for Ed
                    for expenses. Ed took off with two or three security agents, flew back to Paris,
                    went down to see his wife before he was supposed to go to Cyprus to catch a
                    ferry from Cyprus to Beirut. All of a sudden, I got a phone call from the
                    Operations Center which said that Djerejian had called in and his wife was ill
                    or upset about his going and he had decided he couldn't go. The security agents
                    were bringing back the $25,000. Kissinger just went ballistic. He was so furious
                    at Djerejian. He was determined to punish him. Ed was kind of exiled for a while
                    to a pretty unimportant job in the European Bureau. He had a promotion rescinded
                    by Kissinger. He overcame this. But Kissinger was absolutely furious over this.
                    Roy Atherton and Joe Sisco protected Djerejian and shielded him from Kissinger's
                    wrath. Kissinger had a famous temper.</p>
                <p>As an aside, Sid Sober, the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary at the time,
                    just rubbed Kissinger the wrong way. Kissinger ordered Atherton or Sisco to get
                    rid of Sid Sober. Sid continued to be the PDAS but we went through elaborate
                    steps to hide the fact from Kissinger that Sid Sober was the PDAS. He would not
                    attend meetings with Kissinger. We would find someone else to go. If Roy was
                    traveling and we had a memo for Kissinger, we put someone else's name down on
                    the memo so that he didn't know that Sid Sober was there. It was a case where
                    Kissinger would be furious at people but then the FS would protect those
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>But after Djerejian pulled out, David Mack, the office director for the Jordan,
                    Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, volunteered to go to Beirut along with Bob Hope, who
                    at had been a DCM in Beirut and knew all the actors and was working in
                    Personnel. It took tremendous courage. They went to Nicosia. They got on a ferry
                    boat with a bodyguard or two. If the Christians in East Beirut weren't going to
                    protect them, two bodyguards wouldn't have made the slightest bit of difference.
                    But in an act of tremendous courage, they went to East Beirut, spent a week or
                    two there talking to people and then calling in reports and then writing up the
                    reports. That really gave us a window on the thinking. But our ability to
                    influence either the Muslim or the Christian participants in the civil war in
                    Lebanon was very limited. At the time, Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians had
                    established a tremendous presence in West Beirut. We worked out through the CIA
                    an informal arrangement with the PLO in terms of the PLO giving some protection
                    to the embassy in Beirut to keep it from being attacked by Lebanese Muslim
                    organizations. The CIA acted as the middleman in doing this. That started the
                    contacts between the PLO and Yasser Arafat. It was in the context of Lebanon and
                    the civil war there in the mid-'70s that we started dealing with them over
                    issues like the security of the embassy in Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at a time when contact with the PLO was strictly
                        forbidden.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, it was. As part of the 1975 Sinai II disengagement agreement, the
                    side MOU that Prime Minister Rabin insisted on having and we negotiated with the
                    Israelis, one clause in that MOU was that the United States would refrain from
                    any contact with the PLO unless and until the PLO renounced terrorism and
                    recognized Israel's right to exist. I was told that Kissinger thought this was
                    kind of a throwaway and felt that it would not be any particular constraint on
                    American foreign policy in terms of dealing with this issue. In fact, the
                    security channel became a conduit for discussion with the PLO on political
                    issues as well, but it was carried out through the CIA, not by State Department
                    officials. But as of the time of that MOU, contact with the PLO, which had been
                    allowed before then and people in Beirut and Syria used to talk to Palestinians,
                    after '75 overt contact ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is still a reflection of this as we speak today. The
                        head of the CIA is going out to talk to both the Palestinians and the
                        Israelis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: That's a different story. We'll get to that later. That role really
                    took place in 1997 when Israeli-Palestinian security contacts broke down and the
                    CIA was asked by the Israeli Shin Bet to facilitate the reestablishment of
                    Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. It's in that context that the CIA and
                    George Tenant got sucked into this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick that up later on.</hi>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>You were there from '75-'77?</p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the transition when the Carter administration came
                        in? Every time there is an election of a president, promises are made to get
                        the Jewish vote, particularly about the embassy moving to Jerusalem. How did
                        the actual transition work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: About the time of the election, particularly as the campaign was going
                    on, and I've seen this during other pre-election periods and afterwards, foreign
                    policy issues all of a sudden took a backseat to everything else. At that point
                    the objective was not to let any crises arise which could become an election
                    issue. As we got into August and September of 1976, the amount of work decreased
                    tremendously because people were focused on the conventions, on the campaigns,
                    on the debates. Kissinger himself was much less active. When the election took
                    place and Jimmy Carter won, we went from being tremendously busy to being
                    tremendously not busy simply because everybody was checking in on him. The
                    senior leadership in the State Department was basically wrapping things up. They
                    were not taking any new initiatives or trying to conclude agreements. Of course,
                    any time you have a transition, everybody is tasked to write transition papers
                    for the issue that they're working. There was a tremendous number of papers
                    written by the Near East Bureau during that period because there were so many
                    active problems going on. The very interesting thing about that transition was
                    that once Carter was sworn in and Vance became Secretary of State, Carter
                    focused almost immediately like a laser on the Arab-Israeli situation. Almost
                    from the time of the inauguration and Vance becoming Secretary of State, Roy
                    Atherton stayed on as Assistant Secretary. The focus was on Arab-Israeli issues.
                    The first three or four months of 1977 were extremely busy in terms of thinking
                    through our Middle East policy, what we were trying to achieve, drafting a
                    tremendous number of papers? If you draft a paper for the President from the
                    Secretary of State for a visit or an issue, those papers are fairly short, not
                    more than three or four pages. But we used to do 15-20 page papers for Carter on
                    the Middle East issue, on the Arab-Israeli issue. The Carter administration
                    started off with a focus on the Middle East. The very first trip that Cyrus
                    Vance took abroad was to the Middle East. I organized the trip and put it
                    together, worked out the schedule with Vance's people, worked out with Roy the
                    tasking of all the papers and the preparation of all the trip books. And he went
                    to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, he may have had a brief stop in
                    Lebanon. That trip then set the stage for visits to Washington of the leaders
                    from Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia for meetings with President Carter.
                    That in turn led to Carter's focus on the peace process and laid the groundwork
                    for continuing Kissinger's efforts, particularly on the Egyptian-Israeli front,
                    which culminated in 1978 in the Camp David agreement and the Egyptian-Israeli
                    peace treaty.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: It was very much Kissinger running the show. My recollection on the

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I left in July of 1977 to go to FSI, where I studied Arabic for two
                    year, one year in Rosslyn, and then the second year at the Arabic language
                    school in Tunis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about becoming an Arab specialist at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: At that point, I was really taken with the Arab-Israeli situation. I
                    had worked on it for seven years, an intensive period starting with the
                    hijackings in 1970 and the Jordan civil war, the various terrorist incidents in
                    Israel when I was there, the 1973 war, then Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy. So,
                    as a new FS officer, I really felt that I had been thrown into the maelstrom. I
                    found it tremendously exciting and stimulating and if you worked those issues
                    you really have the feeling that the top levels of the State Department and the
                    White House were following them. You felt like you were involved in something
                    that was important and where you could make a difference. So, I saw Arabic
                    language training as sort of a ticket into continuing on this process. I thought
                    at the time based on discussions with Ed Walker, who was working on the peace
                    process and with Roy Atherton and so forth, that I didn't want to be the
                    traditional Arabist. I wanted to be someone who specialized in Arab-Israeli
                    issues. Although I never learned Hebrew, I never saw myself as a dyed in the
                    wool Arabist, but really someone who was working in the Levant on the nexus of
                    the peace process and Israel's relations with its neighbors.</p>

                <p>ABINGTON: To a degree. In 1977, there were very few FS officers who signed up to
                    take Arabic. After the breaking of relations with the United States by a number
                    of Arab countries in '67, and it was only in the mid-'70s that relations were
                    restored, so the assignment opportunities for people who spoke Arabic were
                    pretty limited. As a result, not very many people of my generation signed up to
                    take Arabic. When I started taking Arabic, there were maybe six people, but only
                    three of us had signed up for the two-year program. There was concern about the
                    viability of the language school in Tunis because there were so few people
                    signed up for Arabic that FSI was considering closing down the school. They got
                    around it because they took a number of military students who after doing one
                    year of language at the Defense Language School in Monterey went for their
                    second year in Tunis. They also picked up some people in the field who wanted to
                    learn Arabic and had them do their first and second year of language training in
                    Tunis. That's how they kept the school going. But at that point, hardly anybody
                    was signing up for long-term Arabic language. People felt there was not a good
                    career future as an Arabist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the students who were with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was a guy named Steve Engleton, who served in Jordan and one or
                    two other Arab countries but basically dropped out of NEA and focused on Europe
                    and never went back. Then there was Dick McKee, a brilliant linguist. Dick was a
                    South Asian specialist. I think he spoke Urdu and he learned Hindi and he knew
                    Arabic and French and two or three other languages. But Dick had a couple of
                    assignments in the Near East area but then he went back to South Asia and also
                    to Turkey. I think I was the only one who really stuck with the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Tunis as a spot to put the language
                        school? It had been moved by force majeure from Beirut, a delightful spot in
                        the pre-trouble time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I thought Tunis was not a very good place for the language school.
                    Shortly after I got there, I asked directions from a Tunisian policeman in
                    Arabic. First he answered me in German. Then he answered me in French. Then he
                    figured out I was an American so he answered me in English. I spoke to him in
                    Arabic, which he seemed to understand. And he spoke to me in English. It was
                    just not a very good environment for learning Arabic. Most Tunisians spoke
                    French. The North African dialect I found hard to understand. The school would
                    have been much better located in someplace like Jordan or Syria, where you have
                    an Arabic dialect that is more widely understood than the North African
                    dialect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was around '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I got on a plane which had a stop in Tripoli, Libya. At that point we
                    didn't have diplomatic relations with Libya. I flew on to Damascus. I was
                    assigned to the embassy in Damascus. I replaced my friend Ed Walker as head of
                    the political section in Damascus and was there from 1979 until 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of relations in that period between
                        Syria and the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: The Assad regime was a very secretive regime. We opened the embassy in
                    Damascus after the 1974 Israel-Syria disengagement agreement which had been
                    brokered by Henry Kissinger. The Syrian regime was very heavily dependent upon
                    the Soviet Union for economic assistance and especially for military assistance.
                    The Soviets were the principal supplier of military equipment to the Syrians.
                    There was a very large Soviet presence in Syria, Soviet military advisors there.
                    The stated goal of President Assad was to achieve military parity with Israel.
                    The relationship between Israel and Syria continued to be very tense. The
                    Egyptian embassy was around the corner from the American Embassy. Syria had
                    broken relations with Egypt over the Camp David summit and the Egyptian-Israeli
                    agreement. The Egyptian Embassy had been broken into by a Syrian mob.
                    Demonstrations like that in Syria only took place at the instigation of the
                    Syrian government. The Egyptian Embassy was basically ransacked and was pretty
                    much in ruin. That was a clear sign by President Assad that he disapproved of
                    Sadat's policies. There was a lot of tension between the United States and the
                    Syrian government because the U.S. government was trying to promote the
                    Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. Of course, the majority of the Arab world had
                    broken relations with Egypt, had expelled Egypt from the Arab League. The Arab
                    League had moved from Cairo to Tunis. The United States was not only pushing the
                    Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement but the second part of that agreement, which
                    was autonomy for the Palestinians and trying to promote those negotiations,
                    which in fact started and were ongoing. The PLO at the time was headquartered in
                    Beirut in '79 but there was a love-hate relationship between the PLO led by
                    Yasser Arafat and President Assad. Assad felt that Syria was really the center
                    of the Arab world, that it represented Arab nationalist aspirations. He very
                    much tried to control the Palestinian issue in terms of not wanting a separate
                    peace. He made threatening noises towards King Hussein when he thought that
                    Hussein might be edging towards negotiations with Israel. There was a lot of
                    tension between the United States and Syria during this period. The nature of
                    the Syrian regime was such that it was a very secretive regime. We had
                    relatively limited contacts with political figures in the regime. The ambassador
                    would see Assad from time to time when there were visitors, the Secretary of
                    State or congressional delegations. But in general, the American ambassador did
                    not have access to President Assad for meetings or for appointments to discuss
                    issues. The primary person that the ambassador dealt with was the Syrian Foreign
                    Minister, Abdel Halim Khaddam, who is still a vice president in the Syrian
                    regime even though Assad has died. We had very little official access to Syrian
                    officials and to the Baath Party. They kept us at arm's length and when we did
                    have discussions with them they were fairly pro forma, a very heavy dose of
                    Syrian propaganda. It was quite difficult to figure out what was going on in
                    Syria. Of course, there was the ongoing Lebanon problem. By that point, 1979,
                    Syria had something like 30-35,000 troops in Lebanon. It controlled Beirut. It
                    controlled the Bekaa Valley. In between the Syrian-controlled area and the
                    Lebanese border was the PLO. Of course, there were clashes at the time. There
                    were infiltration attempts by the PLO into Israel. There were exchanges of fire.
                    There were Israeli incursions into southern Lebanon. But there was this
                    understanding between Syria and Israel that even though Israel was going into
                    Lebanon the area where it would operate ground forces would only be between the
                    Lebanese-Israeli border and the Litani River. North of the Litani River were
                    Syrian troops and Israel was careful not to go north of the Litani River and
                    confront Syrian troops with ground operations. Israel was carrying on air raids
                    against Palestinian targets in West Beirut. You had an incredibly unstable
                    situation. And you had a relatively hostile Syrian regime. (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>You had an internal situation in Syria that was very complicated because the
                    Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni organization, was carrying out major attacks of
                    terrorism and assassinations against the Alaoui Baathist regime of Syria. You
                    had a break in relations between Syria and Iraq because of the rivalry between
                    Hafez El-Assad and Saddam Hussein, two different factions of the Baath Party,
                    each saying that they were the legitimate party, not recognizing the other. It
                    was an incredibly complex mix of a lot of different issues and it was very
                    difficult to figure out what was going on in Damascus because of the nature of
                    this regime.</p>
                <p>When I got to Damascus, there was the announcement that Syria and Iraq were going
                    to unite. This had been spurred by the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. But within
                    a matter of a couple of months, the whole process of discussing unification
                    between Syria and Iraq broke down into tremendous acrimony which led eventually
                    to a break in diplomatic relations between Syria and Iraq. It was during this
                    period that the Muslim Brotherhood attacks against the Syrian regime started
                    intensifying. There was intelligence and we knew that the Syrian government felt
                    that the Muslim Brotherhood attacks were being assisted by the Iraqis in terms
                    of providing explosives, arms, infiltrating people across the Iraqi-Syrian
                    border. There also was some evidence that Muslim Brotherhood types in Saudi
                    Arabia were sending money and providing guidance to people inside Syria. There
                    was also a very deep-seated Syrian belief that the Jordanian government was
                    allowing Muslim Brotherhood operatives safe haven in Amman and was allowing them
                    to infiltrate across the border. When I first got there in '79 for the next year
                    to year and a half there was a mounting internal crisis over this challenge to
                    the Alaoui regime. This took the form of assassination of Alaoui political and
                    military figures. The Muslim Brotherhood started assassinating Soviet military
                    advisors and carrying out bombing attacks against Soviet military compounds and
                    very brutal bombing attacks against Syrian government facilities as well. I
                    think it's really interesting because these bombing attacks were as brutal as
                    anything that's taken place in the Middle East in the last 20 years yet because
                    of the secretive nature of the Syrian regime they tried to cover up the attacks.
                    It was very difficult to get accurate information about who had been killed and
                    so forth. In the summer of 1980, a suicide bomber drove a car to Syrian air
                    force headquarters and the Syrian air force not only was a military arm but it
                    was a military intelligence arm that Assad relied on very much. It was one of
                    the predominant military intelligence units. And he was an air force officer
                    himself. This car bomb killed around 50-60 people in the building. I can
                    remember when the bomb went off, I was in the DCM's office and you could see the
                    windows bulge from the concussion of the bomb. Fortunately, we had Mylar on the
                    windows. Otherwise it would have blown the windows out. I remember going to the
                    American school about a block away from air force headquarters. There was this
                    huge explosion. The Syrians sealed the area off, would not let any foreigners in
                    and were busy removing casualties. We heard through various sources that 50-70
                    people had been killed. Fortunately, the American community school had just been
                    adjourned for summer vacation. There were a number of windows blown out in the
                    school. I remember walking on the school grounds and finding a boot with a foot
                    in it that had been blown a block or so away from the site of this explosion.
                    These bombings were incredibly brutal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it's something that hasn't raised much notice in the
                        West.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: There was another bombing in '80 or '81 in downtown Damascus. A big car
                    bomb went off and killed about 200 people. It took place at the height of the
                    lunch hour rush time. Everyone would go home for lunch and take a nap in the
                    afternoon and then resume work in the late afternoon. This very powerful bomb
                    went off in a very busy part of Damascus. It was on a Sunday. It blew up about
                    three or four buses packed with people. I saw the area. It literally took the
                    sides of a couple of apartment buildings off. I don't think we ever knew how
                    many people were killed by that. But we estimated that there were 200-300
                    deaths. It created a very dangerous and uncertain situation in Syria. It led to
                    increasing tension between Syria and its Arab neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that the United States would be an
                        obvious target since we were such a promoter of this peace. Of course, this
                        was against Syria. It had nothing to do with the peace process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: It had nothing to do with the peace process, but there were
                    conversations with the Syrian Foreign Minister in which he voiced very strong
                    suspicion that the U.S. was involved in the bombings, that the United States was
                    giving through the CIA assistance to the Muslim Brotherhood. In that part of the
                    world, there is a very deep feeling of the omnipotent power of the CIA and
                    people are very wrapped up in conspiracies. Of course, the CIA had been involved
                    in a lot of stuff in the region. One could understand why the Syrians were
                    suspicious. On one occasion, the ambassador had been summoned by the foreign
                    minister-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: The first two years I was there, it was Talcott Seelye. Then from '81
                    to '82 it was Bob Paganelli. Seelye was summoned by Khaddam. I was head of the
                    political section, so I always went along as notetaker and wrote all the cables.
                    Khaddam produced a couple of walkie talkies made by Motorola and said that these
                    walkie talkies had been recovered from the bodies of a couple of Muslim
                    Brotherhood types and he cited this as proof that the United States was involved
                    in aiding the Muslim Brotherhood. I remember Seelye denying it but said that he
                    would send these walkie talkies back to Washington, the information on them and
                    so forth, and we would try to get to the bottom of it. Of course, the Syrian
                    suspicion was heightened because we had a ban on the export of any kind of
                    sensitive equipment to Syria. I can recall that the Syrians had asked for
                    Motorola walkie talkies that they wanted to use for the Syrian presidential
                    guard. It was a major decision whether or not to approve the export license of
                    these Motorola radios to the Syrians even though it was for presidential
                    security. So, one can understand the suspicion of the Syrians. If they wanted
                    these Motorola radios and we were making such a big deal out of it and at the
                    same time they found these Motorola radios on the bodies of Muslim Brotherhood,
                    they concluded that somehow the United States was involved.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: I think that's what it turned out to be, an off the shelf item that had
                    been smuggled into Lebanon and used as communication devices for these
                    Brotherhood types.</p>

                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: Let me get there first. There was kind of a mounting crisis. In early
                    1981, there was serious concern after the Reagan administration had taken over
                    that the Syrian government was about to invade Jordan. Relations between Assad
                    and Hussein had deteriorated considerably over the course of the previous year
                    because of a really deep-seated Syrian suspicion that somehow the Hashemite
                    government was aiding the Muslim Brotherhood. In fact, I suspected that they
                    were aiding them as well. Jordanian intelligence is very good. There certainly
                    was a pretty fair amount of evidence that senior Muslim Brotherhood people were
                    headquartered in Amman, and I just cannot believe that the Jordanian
                    intelligence didn't know they were there. Now, was Jordanian intelligence
                    turning a blind eye or actively helping them? I don't know. But Assad made some
                    very threatening military moves with armored divisions toward the Jordanian
                    border. I can remember writing a telegram. We had been notified by the Near East
                    Bureau that the Reagan administration was increasingly concerned about what was
                    going on. I remember writing an analysis which we sent in very high precedent to
                    Washington. I was told there was a National Security Council meeting going on
                    and the analysis was that these were threatening moves by Assad to try to put
                    pressure on Hussein because of his belief that the Jordanians were helping the
                    Muslim Brotherhood but that Assad was a very cautious person and knew that if he
                    were to actually make a threatening move against Jordan it would inevitably lead
                    to an Israeli military action. At the time, Begin was the prime minister and
                    Sharon was the defense minister. It was our assessment that Assad was not going
                    to invade Jordan but was merely trying to carry on a war of nerves and threaten
                    the Jordanians. But given his cautiousness he would not actually send troops
                    into Jordan and reminding people that in 1970 it was Assad's predecessor who
                    actually sent tanks across the border that led to the coup that brought Assad to
                    power. This was very important because one of the options being looked aand
                    being recommended by some of the ideologues in the State Departmenwas that the
                    U.S. should carry out air strikes against Syria not only to protect Jordan but
                    indirectly to send a message to the Soviets that the United States would not
                    tolerate Soviet surrogates, which Syrian was looked upon as, threatening
                    America's friends in the region. It was people like Rick Burt and Paul Wolfowitz
                    who were advocating the use of U.S. air strikes against Syria.</p>

                    people in place at the time. Cap Weinberger was strong. But you had Dick Allen
                    as the national security advisor. He was very weak. You had Al Haig as Secretary
                    of State, who was kind of wacko. You had Rick Burt. You had Paul Wolfowitz. Real

                <p>ABINGTON: Richard Perle was at the Defense Department. Today it's kind of hard to
                    imagine that the Reagan administration seriously considered this option but they
                    were looking at it. The cable that I did really helped convince people that it
                    was not as big a crisis as it appeared.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the Israelis were egging us on. The Israelis were providing us
                    intelligence in their assessment that Syria was seriously considering invading
                    Jordan. But Begin and Sharon had their own agenda. They wanted to whack the
                    Syrians in order to get at the Palestinians. I saw this throughout the period.
                    As I was reading the telegrams from the defense attaches in Tel Aviv and
                    Ambassador Sam Lewis' talks with the Israelis, I felt that the Israelis were
                    giving us a very one-sided, biased assessment of Syria and Syrian intentions and
                    that they had their own agenda very much at work. But you see this frequently.
                    Washington was predisposed to listen to the Israelis. Assad was viewed as
                    hostile to American interests. He certainly had no defenders in Washington at
                    the time, still doesn't. But this lack of understanding of what was really going
                    on and the predilection to credit Israeli assessments much more than was
                    warranted, that was 20 years ago and we still see it today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after this crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: We had an excellent military attach� who was on the road all the time.
                    He was an Army lieutenant colonel. He was first rate, spoke Arabic very well. He
                    must have worked 80 hours a week. He and his assistant attach�, an enlisted man,
                    were on the road all the time checking out military deployments. He had a
                    fantastic collection of the military flashes that are painted on the rear ends
                    of vehicles so that you know what unit they are. His reporting was terrific in
                    terms of tracking the movement of Syrian military units. He would be up in the
                    middle of the night driving around, darting in and out of convoys. I really felt
                    that the Israelis? His reporting was shared with the Israelis and the Israelis -
                    I saw this on several occasionwould say that they had an informant who alleged
                    that the Syrians were doing a, b, and c. One specific incident had to do with
                    the deployment of SCUD missiles. I know that we in the embassy in Damascus felt
                    that this was a crock - the CIA station chief, the military attach�,
                    myselbecause it didn't make sense what the Israelis were alleging in terms of
                    deployment of SCUD missiles. This guy went out in the middle of the night at
                    some danger to himself because Syrians were not friendly and he confirmed thaand
                    he was instructed to do so by Washington, by DIthe SCUD missiles had not been
                    deployed. It was our assessment that the Israelis were using these fabricated
                    sources or maybe they were using signal intelligence and getting us to check it
                    out. So, we were sort of playing their game. But after the initial deployment,
                    through his checking out the situation on the ground? In fact, this was before
                    satellite technology really developed to the point where we had real time
                    intelligence from the satellites. The observation of military attaches was very
                    important. This was true in Syria and it was certainly true in Israel. The
                    Israelis were doing things and it was our military attaches who would see what
                    was happening on the ground that gave us the heads up on various things. The
                    Jordanian border calmed down, but these assassinations were still going on. It
                    was during the spring or summer of 1981 that this section of Hamas, the old
                    section of Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, really rose up against the government
                    forces in the area. Hafez El-Assad in consultation with the Alaoui military
                    leaderand the Alaoui were in all the key military positions, the intelligence
                    units, the special forces, a group called the Defense Forces which was headed by
                    Assad's brother and was deployed in the Damascus area to defend the Alaoui
                    regimthey decided that they had had enough of this uprising, of these
                    assassinations. One has to keep in mind that it was very much targeted against
                    Alaouis. There were many Alaoui officials who were assassinated because they
                    were Alaoui. There had been these brutal car bombings. The government decided
                    that it was going to crush the situation once and for all. Assad's brother,
                    Rifaat El-Assad, deployed the Defense Forces equipped with T-72 tanks to Hamas,
                    closed off the area, went in and just leveled this area where the Muslim
                    Brotherhood was holed up. It was a civilian area. Basically, they shelled it and
                    then they brought in bulldozers and just bulldozed the whole thing. No one knows
                    how many people were killed. I know that it's become the common wisdom that
                    10,000 were killed. In fact, I don't think anyone really knows. But the Syrians
                    sealed off the area. No one could get in or out for about a week until it was
                    over. That really broke the back of the Muslim Brotherhood. There were
                    assassinations, a few bombings, after that. In fact, once when I was going from
                    where the embassy was to a meeting with some Australian colleagues in an area
                    west of Beirut in a suburb called Mezzay, a bomb blew up about 50 yards from my
                    car. It was incredibly frightening because it was a bomb on one of these
                    three-wheel Suzuki vans. The Syrian security people immediately came out and
                    started stopping cars. There was a car in front of me, a white Peugeot. There
                    were three people in it. They panicked and they just were yelled at by the
                    security people to stop. They kept going. This must have been 10-15 yards from
                    me. The security people just opened up with AK-47s and killed all three people
                    in the car. And they turned around and started pointing their guns at me. I was
                    in a little Volkswagen Rabbit and stopped, held my hands in the air, and kept
                    shouting in Arabic that I was a diplomat. They came over and looked at me and
                    told me to get out of there. I haven't been frightened that much many times. You
                    could see how this terrorism really had the regime on edge.</p>

                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>ABINGTON: We could see the buildup. As we read the reporting from the embassy in
                    Tel Aviv and what was in the Israeli press, particularly people like a very
                    famous Israeli military analyst named Zeb Ship, who's been writing for 25 years,
                    his analyses, obviously based on conversations with Sharon and the IDF, you
                    could see the Israeli invasion coming. You could see that the Israelis were
                    looking for an excuse to invade Lebanon and to take out the PLO. During the fall
                    of '81 through the winter, you could see a steadily mounting pressure with more
                    and more belligerent noises being made by Begin and particularly Sharon. It was
                    very clear that Sharon was pushing the limits of the red lines. These informal
                    understandings that the U.S. had helped negotiate, these understandings of what
                    each side could and could not do. One red line was that the Israelis would not
                    carry out air strikes against Syrian forces. The Israeli air force carried out
                    attacks in late '81/early '82, hit targets in the Bekaa, and killed Syrian
                    troops. This was viewed by the Syrians as the Israelis breaking one of the
                    understandings that the United States had negotiated. I remember the Syrians
                    came to us and said, “What are you going to do about this? You helped broker
                    this. This is what the Israelis have done, violating the understanding.” Of
                    course, as usual when something like this happened, we sat on our hands and
                    didn't do anything because the Israelis, particularly with someone like Sharon
                    as defense minister, basically blew us off. This was a time when there was an
                    increasingly acrimonious relationship between Sam Lewis and Sharon and to a
                    degree Menachem Begin. Whenever he would go in and discuss things particularly
                    on instructions to raise U.S. concerns, he would get reamed out by Begin or
                    Sharon and on occasion they would go out and just publicly berate the United
                    States for questioning Israeli motivation with Sam Lewis standing beside him.
                    But the embassies in Tel Aviv and Damascus frankly got into a very acrimonious
                    relationship in terms of our competing analyses of Israeli intentions. We both
                    became very shrill in what we were saying to Washington, not very professional.
                    We saw the worst in Israeli motives and we basically were right. The embassy in
                    Tel Aviv was trying to defend what the Israelis were doing. We thought in
                    Damascus they were looking the other way and not realizing that the Israelis
                    were setting up a situation so they could invade Lebanon. But when the Israelis
                    violated this understanding, the Syrian reaction, Assad's reaction, was to move
                    SA-3 and SA-6 missiles into the Bekaa Valley in order to defend troops there.
                    His rationale was, “If the Israelis do not abide by the understandings and the
                    Americans don't do anything to reassure us that this won't happen again, we
                    therefore have to take these steps to defend our troops in the Bekaa.” That led
                    to a crisis once the Syrians moved those missiles in. That upset the status quo.
                    The Israelis looked upon that as a serious threat to their ability to fly over
                    Lebanon and so forth. Of course, the Syrians said, “The Israelis have no right
                    to fly over Lebanon. They have no right. They have attacked our troops. They are
                    violating Lebanese air space. They violated an understanding against attacking
                    Syrian troops. We have moved these missiles in to defend our troops.” The United
                    States embarked oand I think Phil Habib was the primary negotiatoan effort to
                    persuade the Syrians to withdraw their missiles that was not successful. So, you
                    had this period of mounting tension in late '81 and the first half of '82 caused
                    by these events, by continuing Palestinian PLO attacks against Israel, and it
                    was a crisis that everyone could see coming. I remember sitting on my balcony of
                    my apartment in Damascus, which overlooked Assad's house, early Sunday morning
                    at about 7:00. I had my radio on and was listening to the BBC. The first story
                    was that Palestinians had attempted to assassinate the Israeli ambassador in
                    London, Shlomo Argov, and had shot him, seriously wounding him in the head. He
                    was in a coma and it was not known whether he was going to live or not. I
                    listened to that and said, “The Israelis are going to invade Lebanon today.” I
                    called up the ambassador, Paganelli, and told him this. I said, “It's my belief
                    that this is the excuse that Sharon's been looking for and that there will be an
                    invasion.” In fact, they did invade that day.</p>

                        to the siege of Beirut? There was fighting with Syria, wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ABINGTON: Yes, there was, but the Israeliand this is where Sharon was roundly
                    condemned by the United States and in fact a commission of inquiry in Israel
                    felt that Sharon had misled Begin and the Israeli cabinet as to what his
                    intentions were. It was initially called the Peace for Galilee Campaign.
                    Initially the stated intentions were to go up to the Litani River and clear out
                    the Palestinian presence in southern Lebanon. People anticipated that there
                    would be an Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon for some period of time in
                    order to keep the PLO out. But at that point, people really did not know what
                    Sharon's intentions were. Meanwhile, the Mossad and Sharon and Begin had been
                    negotiating secretly with the Maronites in Beirut, with the Gemayels and the
                    Chamouns. The Israelis and the Lebanese Maronites, the Phalangists, had worked
                    out this scheme that the U.S. was really not aware of to drive out the
                    Palestinians from Lebanon - I don't know if the intention was to drive out the
                    Syrians as weland to install a very strong Phalangist government in Beirut that
                    would enter into an unofficial alliance with Israel. This was all unbeknown to
                    American policymakers. So, this was an unfolding event. Every day that the
                    invasion went on, Israel kept expanding the scope of its military operations.
                    The Syrians from the beginning were very alarmed by this. They saw this as a
                    crisis. They deeply mistrusted Sharon and Begin and they called in Paganelli
                    daily to consult about it. But as the war went on, as the Israelis crossed the
                    Litani, they came into contact with Syrian tank units and they fought pretty
                    fierce battles near Beirut and in the Bekaa and they destroyed a number of
                    Israeli tank units. They attacked the Syrian missile units that had been
                    deployed in the Bekaa and destroyed all of them without losing a single Israeli
                    plane. The Syrian air force, which had carried on periodic clashes with Israel
                    over Lebanese air space, came to the defense of Syrian forces in the Bekaa. In
                    what was a stunning air battle, the Israelis shot down something like 85 Syrian
                    jet fighters without losing a single plane of their own. At that point, the
                    Israelis had uncontested control of Lebanese air space and the siege of Beirut
                    started.</p>
