                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is April 1, 2009 and we are in the residence of Don and
                        Dorothy Novotny in Rockville, Maryland. Don, could you start by telling us a
                        little bit about your childhood, where you were born and grew up and how you
                        turned into the person who you are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Alan thanks, this is very kind of you to do and on behalf of all our FAS
                    (Foreign Agricultural Service) family. As for my early days, it was very unusual
                    to be part of a Czech-American community that had hardly changed its life style
                    and customs and ceremonies from what had been known back in Bohemia before that
                    mass immigration took place in the 1870s. Our family came to Nebraska in 1871.
                    And you know what, 65 years later when I started to school I didn't speak any
                    English but that wasn't a problem because my schoolmates didn't either. It was a
                    Czech community and about my time, they started to bring in German or Nordic
                    ancestry people to be the school teachers at the one room school and so we were
                    forced to learn English. And even during the hardest of times, the depression
                    when I was very young, and in war time, it was a pretty happy, secure existence
                    because all the settlers had their piece of land and food was important in both
                    those trying times and it was a happy situation in which to grow up. I went to
                    school at the University of Nebraska and took ag (agricultural) econ courses.
                    And I had two sisters and my parents lived to a ripe old age and the farm is
                    still in the family, the originally settled farm is still in family hands.</p>
                <p>My introduction to FAS and Washington came because of work with 4-H and
                    participating in the exchange program of the 4-H Foundation which sent me to
                    India when I was 19 or 20 in 1954 and there I met the US agricultural attach�,
                    Tim Engebretson and his secretary, Gil Pickett, and you know, that seemed like a
                    great way to go if I ever wanted to see more of the world. So when I returned
                    after about four or five months in India living in the villages and eating off
                    banana leaves on the floor and doing the whole bit with the local customs I
                    thought I wanted to do more. So I did graduate work on ag economics and searched
                    out Tim Engebretson's agency which was then the fledging FAS and they offered me
                    a job so that got us started.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My first boss was Ray Vickery, the Grain Division Director, and the Branch Chief
                    for whom I worked directly was Bill Starkey, who had a small team of three or
                    four others. We were then involved with the early stages of Public Law 480 which
                    involved sales for foreign currencies, and we often argued with other agencies
                    about food aid programs and whether they interfered with normal commercial trade
                    and whether they do really contribute much to economic development of the
                    recipient countries; it was a very interesting time. Even the new recruits very
                    soon had lots of interaction with people in other agencies of government, State,
                    AID, and Treasury, when there were discussions about the P.L. 480
                    initiatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you expand on the P.L. 480 angles a little bit, Don?
                        For example, can you give an example or case study of one of the countries
                        where this came up and how you resolved it, what kind of conclusions you
                        draw when you try to figures out is it a good program for a given country,
                        is it accomplishing its objectives, how did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: We would go into supply-demand analysis on the country, try to establish
                    what is their normal level of import dependency and from that reach a conclusion
                    about the foundation level of such commercial trade which food aid ought not
                    interfere with. There would be a lot of quibbling with other agencies who were
                    more concerned about protecting the other traditional suppliers, that was at an
                    early stage when the USA was not a very large commercial exporter of ag
                    commodities, so that a great part of our exports were possible only through food
                    aid. But that, of course, began to change with the overseas economic development
                    that followed; and it began to change because on the US side there developed a
                    great interest in ag exports to help the US trade balance.</p>
                <p>I can't really add much, Allan, to the question of other dimensions of the
                    analysis that went into determining how effective this aid was. We did some, you
                    might say, rudimentary attempts at aggregate analysis, to take groups of
                    countries and look at their income levels such as the data were at that time and
                    before and after some periods of food aid, but this was all just too early in
                    the game to have much empirical basis on which to make any such judgment. So the
                    arguments just raged on; the Canadians, the Australians and Argentines would
                    complain that some of these food aid programs are impinging on their ability to
                    develop exports and prosper and no doubt they sometimes did. Not much more I
                    could say. These kinds of issues always came up when foreign delegations
                    visited, they came up when there were meetings of international groups, like the
                    International Wheat Agreement and the FAO bodies; they would take note and they
                    would also gather statistics and try to do analysis of whether Food Aid was
                    damaging to the development of the recipient countries as well as to the
                    expansion of exports by other competing exporters, commercial exporters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you joined FAS in 1950 what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: I joined in March of 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went overseas to Japan when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: I was assigned as assistant ag attach� to the US embassy in Tokyo, Japan
                    in January 1960 and spent four and one-half years there. The ambassador was
                    MacArthur, nephew to the famous general, who was later followed by Reischauer.
                    My immediate boss, the attach�, initially was Chuck Elkinton and later Joe
                    Dodson. Serving with me there was were Russ Strobel and Don Motz and then
                    following me was Jimmy Minyard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what did you do in Japan? Well, first of all why
                        Japan, why were you interested in Japan, or was that offered to you? How did
                        that system work where you were a civil servant in those days and going out
                        on your first tour, what was the dance like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Oh, I hit the ground running. I wanted to get into this and so I studied
                    Spanish for a year and of course I thought I'd mastered it, nothing of the kind,
                    but any way I was getting so I could use it some; every day the morning classes
                    at the Foreign Service Institute. And then I decided I'd branch out into
                    something else so I took Russian for a year, and then, wouldn't you know, I got
                    sent to Japan. (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd that happen? I mean, how did they offer you Japan,
                        was it just kind of a bolt out of the blue, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: I think Bob Tetro, Sr., who was then in charge of the attach�
                    assignments, just felt this would be a good assignment, and that it would be a
                    good fit, whatever. In those days nobody was being sent to language school.
                    Certainly Japan was a place where a lot was starting to happen, and so indeed
                    when we got there, we were just in the midst of a big review to decide whether
                    to give up on the US Wheat (Associates) office and close it down and after a
                    couple of months it was decided to go on. And they brought in a guy from Oregon
                    by the name of Jim Hutchinson to head the office. Incidentally I take great
                    pride and credit in that I helped Jim find an assistant, Paul Sone, who had
                    worked for a governor and had excellent English. Paul helped not only the wheat
                    office greatly, but also the whole cooperator group to get more established and
                    vitalized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the Jim Hutchinson who had been general sales
                        manager?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes. In Japan he represented western wheat states for I think around 15
                    years, and then he came back to USA to serve as general sales manager in FAS for
                    a few years and I think he retired after that. When Dick Baum of Western Wheat
                    and Clarence Palmby of US Feed Grains Council made their first visits the
                    attach� asked me to deal with them because I had some background in grain and I
                    had been working with the western wheat office somewhat even before coming to
                    Tokyo. So then I helped the Feed Grains office get their start. And the third
                    main thing that stands out was starting the poultry market program. We had a
                    visit from Joe Parker, who was the first head of the poultry export arm of the
                    US poultry industry at that time and Japan looked like a good first target in
                    the Asian area and again I worked with them to find a good local person who
                    could head the office, Katzi Toyota was his name. Following Parker's visit,
                    Katzi and I went down to visit some department stores in Osaka and the result of
                    it was we started in-store promotion which was the poultry industry's first
                    project. And that just grew and grew and grew; everything grew, I mean it was an
                    exciting time for US ag exports and a time when one could really see the
                    accomplishments of the ag attach� office. So soon the office grew rapidly in
                    size.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you wound up in Tokyo and they transferred you to New
                        Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, yes. I wasn't all that enamored with the heavy social schedule and
                    indeed in Tokyo it was extremely heavy. There was every night an important
                    social engagement with Japanese counterparts and cooperators and government
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Every night?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Every night of the work week. And it would go from one gathering to
                    another and to another. Those were also times when the social schedule in the
                    diplomatic circuit was extremely heavy and a great emphasis was placed upon
                    active involvement in that by the senior Foreign Service wives in the embassy.
                    So by the time we were three, four years into that life, my wife and I were not
                    sure we could raise a family in such settings and it's just not normal life. So
                    when FAS talked to me about going to New Zealand to head the office where there
                    was only one person in the office, I was somewhat ambivalent, and Dorothy as
                    well. But we went and you know it was like being ag representative to the state
                    of Kansas or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember you making that comment once that it was a lot
                        like Kansas except Kansas was a whole lot more exciting. (laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, anyway. There it was the complete opposite. There was no expansion
                    of trade or export development to work on; instead it was calming the concerns
                    of the New Zealand meat board and New Zealand dairy board, because they were
                    trying to establish markets in the USA and we were not very cooperative because
                    we had import limitations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about that a little bit, about the meat
                        import law and the dairy quotas and what kind of impact that had on your
                        work in New Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Well I mean that was the work, it was to keep current and to find the
                    best face to put on the American domestic and import policies and to try to
                    maintain you know, happy relationships with the people in those industries in
                    New Zealand so that one could do a good reporting job and also be in a position
                    to you know, represent the US each time there was a new development in the US to
                    be able to explain it to them in the best light we could. And also to be able to
                    put New Zealand people from the American side in contact with the appropriate
                    New Zealand counterparts. So useful functions we could perform but they were
                    completely different from those in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your reporting mostly competition analysis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Competition not so much because the US was competing with New Zealand
                    products in third countries, at least certainly not commercially; rather it was
                    reporting on the competition in the sense that these are industries here that
                    were trying to ship to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. And when did you leave New Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: I finished in New Zealand I guess in 1965, so I was there barely two
                    years and Ray Vickery, who was still in charge of the grain division at that

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennedy Round?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, it primarily involved work with the Kennedy Round of trade
                    negotiations under the GATT, which was in full swing, and where the formation of
                    the European Common Market was becoming more and more a matter of concern to
                    American agriculture. And so I waltzed right into the midst of that and began
                    almost immediately making trips to London and Brussels and Geneva to talk to
                    counterparts about the future development of the grain imports and exports into
                    and out of Europe, and now that there was to be a common market, how it would
                    bear on the United States.</p>
                <p>We first had an agreement with the United Kingdom, who at that stage was not yet
                    a EU member but thinking about it, because the original common market was only
                    six European countries. We fashioned an agreement with the British about how big
                    their imports would be every year and some assurance they would continue those
                    imports. We thought that would provide some kind of foundation for advancing the
                    same notion with the European market, the larger unit next door. But within a
                    short period it was evident that was a disappointment because UK crops were
                    getting bigger due to the advancement of technology and the higher price
                    supports that were beginning to adjust in preparation for joining the common
                    market. Those higher price supports were providing additional incentives, so it
                    was a losing battle.</p>
                <p>So by the time the crucial stage of the Kennedy Round came around, with that UK
                    experience, we had to lower the sights a little bit. And Irwin Hedges was the ag
                    representative that Ray Ioanes sent over to the STR, a relatively new White
                    House agency. Irwin was sort of given the job of being the go-between, between
                    the diplomats and the wall streeters and all the others on the one side, and, on
                    the other side, the ag people, the Department of Agriculture, to try to fashion
                    some way of appeasing the ag sector who was terribly worried about the way the
                    common market would ruin the prospects for a very, very prosperous American
                    agriculture based on exports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If we could stop on that for a minute or two. Turner Oyloe
                        made the comment once to me that the Common Agricultural Policy was viewed
                        in Europe and in the Department of State as the glue that held the European
                        Economic Community together and that, therefore, agriculture was pushed kind
                        of onto the back burner by the Department of State and sacrificed, if you
                        will, on the altar of European unity. Was that fairly apparent at the time,
                        was that a received wisdom, did that play into the thinking as you were
                        trying to negotiate, whether at the Kennedy Round, or separately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: That was the handwriting on the wall at all times. And the best the ag
                    sector could do and ag officials, was to try to convince their opposition within
                    this government and those overseas that agriculture need not be so heavily
                    favored in Europe, that there was enough other reason for them to grow and unify
                    and that US agriculture shouldn't have to give up so much.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that wasn't accepted either in State Department or
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: It never was. When it came to crunch time on crunch matters, I would say
                    it was about January, February, March of 1967. We spent months in Europe, mainly
                    Geneva. Howard Worthington was chief USDA rep and I sort of had helped him on
                    the grain and bulk commodities, and then there was another one or two persons
                    from the FAS trade policy unit. So we had a team of about four people.</p>
                <p>Oscar Zaglitz was also on that team. Oscar had spent his career in finance and
                    banking circles in I believe both Germany and Switzerland, Zurich, and somehow
                    he'd been in contact with Ray Ioanes, who had spent a number of years in Germany
                    with the occupation, and so that led him to come to know Oscar. Oscar was put in
                    charge of monetary and economic matters in the FAS International Monetary
                    Branch. Oscar had enormous influence over our little team and he was very
                    helpful because he knew the background of government and economics in Europe,
                    the French side the British side, the Swiss side, whatever. And that was a
                    critical time for this whole conflict between American agriculture and the
                    formation of the common market.</p>
                <p>We spent months there. Occasionally John Schnittker would come over; he was the
                    responsible person in USDA, whether it was undersecretary or assistant secretary
                    at that time, and Ray Ioanes was there a little bit more often, he was the
                    administrator of FAS. During the final stages, Ray was there probably for a
                    month and John was there for almost as long. It was a real pressure time. Two or
                    three of us would go to meet with two or three of the core of the Brussels team
                    in the official residence of the director general of GATT called Villa Bogage;
                    we'd go there almost every day and discuss how important American agriculture
                    was to the success to the trade liberalization movement in the Kennedy Round,
                    etc., and how important certain things were to the development of the European
                    community. It went on and on and on.</p>
                <p>And you couldn't believe the opulent life in between with dinners and lunches.
                    Life in Geneva, Switzerland at the time, people can't imagine today how easy and
                    inexpensive it was, the finest of food in the finest of restaurants, the
                    penthouse dining rooms in the finest hotels, and we went from one to another,
                    arguing with our European counterparts and often teaming up with reps from
                    Canada, Australia, Argentina and occasionally somebody from Russia and Japan; it
                    was like nobody else in the world counted, you know.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Anyway, with the original EU commissioner of agriculture, Louis Rabot the
                    quintessential Frenchman, we hit upon the concept of self-sufficiency ratio; we
                    asked why not bind the level of self-sufficiency for this fledging European
                    community? And the Europeans were somewhat interested in the idea, I think
                    because the Germans and the Brits felt like this may be a way to keep the French
                    a little bit less you know, demanding, less powerful in the new EU setup, and so
                    during those late months of the Kennedy Round deadlock we began to focus on this
                    idea and we did all kinds of calculations about the history and direction of the
                    self-sufficiency of the European community countries ion grain. Well we got to
                    the point where we thought they might buy on to idea this and at a certain stage
                    they were about ready to. They, in fact, seemed ready to but at the same time we
                    had a fierce battle developing with other exporting countries who wanted to make
                    sure their interests were protected and that there was a floor price for grain
                    in the world market. The voices of importing voices countries were comparatively
                    minor, but they wanted to have a maximum price too, which was sort of a take-off
                    from the original idea of the international wheat agreement of 1949. So we began
                    to examine that and there was such concern about how were to defend this kind of
                    a minimum price, when after all everybody was worried the Americans were going
                    to produce and flood the world. So the deadlock shifted to the other exporting
                    countries and we had interminable meetings with them and they had lots of money
                    for cocktail parties so it went on even longer. (laughter) Maybe there is nobody
                    else yet alive who can recall those long sessions, oh my God, anyway.</p>
                <p>So the deadlock strangely shifted to the exporting countries and they had wheat
                    board representatives and there was irritation on the US side because only a few
                    industry people could attend, persons who were chosen by the secretary's office,
                    some grower's reps and someone from the grain companies. In order to get the
                    export countries to go along with this self-sufficiency ratio idea, which they
                    thought was somewhat dubious, we had to begin to create a framework of a cartel,
                    a market sharing formula. It went into unbelievable detail, who would do what
                    when the prices came down to so and so, which prices would you use as an
                    indicator and whether you would use a basket of prices and how you would adjust
                    country A's share of world trade if he had a short crop, and so on and so on and
                    so forth. It was pretty intricate and yet you know, it looked like maybe it
                    could be made to work.</p>
                <p>But what I was totally unaware of was the explosiveness of this kind of thing if
                    brought back and dumped in the laps of the export houses, who had just in recent
                    years pulled off some of their first grand huge export sales to Russia and were
                    enjoying fantastic growth in markets in Japan, Korea and so on, particularly
                    Japan at that stage, and were optimistic about the future of their business. So,
                    okay, we worked out this elaborate thing: self-sufficiency limits to guarantee
                    markets and keep the common market under control, and then, with the exporters,
                    a market sharing agreement and minimum price. No one was very comfortable with
                    this, but all felt that if this is what it takes to get Europe's common market
                    and agricultural policy under control, then it is a good thing. And, of course,
                    you know, stability as opposed to wild fluctuations of commodity prices had some
                    appeal to USA grower reps too.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Okay, we brought this plan home and John Schnittker and Ray Ioanes and I trotted
                    it out at a big meeting of the broader grain industry which included all the
                    guys from New York and Chicago who were exporting the grain and they just blew a
                    cork, blew up. And I didn't see the whole of it you know, because you don't say
                    everything you think in the big open meeting, but then there were some very
                    hi-level meetings where Mr. Schnittker and Mr. Ioanes and Ed Jaenke from the
                    USDA domestic side, were told a thing or two and of the US administration's
                    overall decision, and they knew they had to change. Whatever concession we could
                    get from Europe was not worth such complete regulation of the grain business,
                    period. We later learned that decisions concerning the developing war in Vietnam
                    also played a part. Anyway, the irony is that when we went back to the
                    negotiating table the first thing we found was that the Europeans had decided to
                    accept an “SSR binding” (self sufficiency ratio) of 88%. Allan, you know what
                    the EU ratio is today? Instead of being net importers of 15 million tons per
                    year, they are now net exporters of maybe 25 million.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that of course, the Common Agricultural Policy, led to
                        the European Community, later the European Union, becoming a competitor. And
                        I remember when I joined Grain Division in 1982, we were putting together,
                        one of the first things you had me do was to write computer programs to
                        generate circular tables. And so we were looking at the circular tables and
                        the question became, do we include the European Union, or the European
                        Community, on the competitor list? And the answer was not, the answer was
                        absolutely not, they are not a competitor. And could you talk about that a
                        little; they were a competitor, it was obvious to those of us who were not
                        steeped in the politics, as an analyst we could see they were but we were
                        told from somewhere on high, they are not a competitor you will not include
                        them on the competitor list in the circular tables. And where did that come
                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: It just, I mean, it came from people who had spent the last ten years or
                    fifteen years, trying to get what they could from Europe treating them as an
                    importer, still hoping that they would remain an importer. And it was about that
                    time when that notion began to change. I think you and I and some of our
                    colleagues in the grain division had as much to do with that as anyone, we said
                    look this is nuts we'd start treating them as a competitor because that's what
                    they had become.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>But let me just finish, that when we got back to Brussels the 88% looked very
                    good but we had to say to the same meeting that this minimum price and this
                    market sharing thing is out. Well, not only Canada and Argentina and Australia
                    bolted, but the common market guys whose spokesmen were French said, well that's
                    no good we want that minimum price too because we, France, see ourselves as an
                    exporter and we want stability in the world market, well you're importer
                    shouldn't matter... So if you are not willing to go along with that floor price
                    and that market sharing arrangement, it's all off. So market sharing went, the
                    self-sufficiency went, and you had nothing more that kind of a warmed over
                    international wheat agreement without teeth for implementing the floor and
                    ceiling and that only makes sense, because you had no teeth. But in a way that
                    was also the last gasp struggle with the common market. So that's the end of
                    that chapter.</p>
                <p>You know, from my perspective, the attention suddenly turned to Russia and it was
                    in 1972 that Henry Kissinger calls up Ray Ioanes and says you know it's time we
                    started to talk to the Russians about long term getting some ways to work
                    together. They can export oil and we will export grain.</p>
                <p>So USDA Secretary Butz made a trip to Moscow; Ray did not go but Clarence Palmby
                    and a couple of staffers went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Earl Butz met with Brezhnev on that trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, I believe he did. In one subsequent trip I can remember in
                    particular, we went in to see Patolichev, who was Stalin's right-hand man and I
                    remember, I guess it was Seeley Lodwick was the delegation head on my side; but
                    I remember Patolichev giving me a whack on my shoulder and saying, you Americans
                    can push us and shove us a few times but then we are going to have to shove
                    back. (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if we can go back to 1972, 1972 was the great grain
                        robbery, and I've heard Larry Panasuk's version of how they didn't do the
                        crop travel after he went out and did a spring crop survey and then came
                        back and then the attach� that he worked for said no more crop travel was
                        necessary and so we got caught sort of with our pants down unaware that they
                        had such a short crop that year. Can you talk about that, about, you know,
                        we didn't have satellite imagery in those days and if the attach�s weren't
                        doing crop travel, we were kind of blind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Well, during our visit, I think it was in February, the one thing they
                    did tell us was they did have a bad freeze and they told us they were interested
                    in all this talk the politicians were making you know about exchanging long-term
                    oil for grain. Of course, we were also offering credit, short term credit, at
                    that time to help get this two way trade going.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>It was Butz who headed that first visit, but for some reason Palmby was concerned
                    about how this would evolve and so the discussions at the Butz level were very
                    perfunctory and they didn't get into substance. But then it was the next day
                    that Palmby and his little team met with First Deputy Minister Kuzmin and we
                    talked about the availability of credit and there was reference to the fact
                    they'd had a freeze, then it all just was left without conclusion. We went home
                    and nothing more came of it. And then Palmby left the department and went to
                    work in New York.</p>
                <p>We had a visit from the Russians along about April but still, you know, just
                    talking a little bit more about the credit program, but no sign they were going
                    to jump onto it. And then the next thing that happened, July I think it was
                    where they came and worked with the grain companies to do a big purchase. First
                    it was a lot of wheat and then it was feed grain too. This had huge
                    repercussions, including adding to inflationary pressures here in USA. Later, in
                    1973 and 1974, we had a moratorium on further sales of grain to USSR, and even
                    an embargo on our soybean exports to USSR. Then, finally, in 1975, when they
                    again embargo a large amount, we set up a long term grain trade agreement with
                    USSR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. The first LTA was signed in 1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yeah, and leading up to that was the cutting across of the contracts, I
                    guess, yes. So in 1972 it was just the large purchase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah that was the great grain robbery.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: That stirred everything up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: And you know, it even contributed to setting up a price controls.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I remember Earl Butz always telling the story about the fights he had with Bill
                    Simon who was Treasury Secretary at that time and Bill Simon was instrumental in
                    administration's decisions on those matters. He said he went over to Bill
                    Simon's office and found that Simon was really hopping mad. So, at that point
                    Butz told Simon a story about the two flies that flew into the horse barn and
                    landed on the handle of the pitchfork. And one of the flies was from time to
                    time gorging himself on the horse manure all around it, and always came back to
                    sit with the other fly on the handle of the pitchfork that was rammed in the
                    manure until finally that fly again tried to fly off but fell splat into the
                    manure. And the punchline of the story, the moral of the story, is, Mr.
                    Secretary, that one must never fly off the handle when he is full of shit!
                    (laughter) I mess up the story, but Butz told time after time of this moment
                    between him and Bill Simon when they had this meeting.</p>
                <p>Anyway, so there were those turmoils and then when 1975 came around and again
                    they had a poor crop and started to buy huge amounts, it led to the bilateral
                    grain agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then in 1980, despite the agreement, there was still
                        an embargo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, but it was an embargo in response to Russian presence in
                    Afghanistan. There were about 25 million tons bought and all those contacts were
                    cancelled. That was 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, the embargo started in 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: But it was in 1975 when the LTA got its start; contracts were not
                    abrogated but apparently the meeting of the top people was instituted as a means
                    of keeping things from getting out of hand.</p>
                <p>Well, I remember Dick Bell was deputy assistant secretary at USDA at that time.
                    It was at that time, whether it was because the Soviets had already began to buy
                    big quantities or because we were anticipating they were going to buy big
                    quantifies, and fearful of it. It was not we in agriculture but others in
                    government that were fearful. Because of that we were asked by the White House
                    to begin working on the framework of a possible bilateral agreement and you
                    know, one afternoon we just sort of, you know, wrote up what it might look like.
                    Really, the ideas in it were based somewhat on the kind of gyrations we'd gone
                    though with the attempt at an international grain agreement back in the Kennedy
                    era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you basically sat down and you drafted the first cut of
                        the LTA in an afternoon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, and it was sent over to the White House and I would say within 24
                    hours we had a phone call saying get on a plane; it was with Dean Hinton who was
                    special ambassador just back from the country with that wild dictator in Africa
                    that was killing people, anyway Dean Hinton was special ambassador with the
                    State Department but he had a lot of experience with commodity issues prior to
                    his overseas assignments. And who was the other one, someone from STR I guess,
                    I'm not sure. The three of us went over and had a first meeting with the Russian
                    counterparts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who'd you meet with on the Russian side, Victor
                        Pershin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, but the chief guy was Gordeyev. I know there has been a Gordeyev in
                    recent years, but this was an earlier guy, and he was a senior operative in the
                    ministry of trade and I guess we also met with the first deputy vice minister,
                    whether it was still Kuzmin or another one I don't recall. But we laid out this
                    idea of an agreement and had a couple of meetings and thought that something
                    like this would be in our common interest. And we came home and then I had an
                    accident and I couldn't go back for the next round and Dick Bell went back
                    himself and they polished and signed it. It provided for twice a year
                    consultations and exchange of information. And it was viewed with always great
                    suspicion by the exporters because they came to like the idea of making these
                    big deals suddenly overnight, but that's what the government wanted, and it
                    wasn't even what Agriculture wanted. But there was a time back there in 1974,
                    1975, even within the high circles of USDA, there was a time when they really
                    did feel like the threat of these sudden large purchases was so great that it
                    represented something that the American system really couldn't cope with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of the price impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes, that's right. You had just come out of the price control era so you
                    wanted to be able to show that you could keep your house in order and so there
                    was more or less acquiescence with the concept of the grain agreement which
                    would pre vent sudden surprises. And we right from the beginning began to invite
                    the Russians to take larger and larger amounts so as to avoid any trade-limiting
                    effect, and they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you at that point were Grain Division director,
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you become director of Grain and Feed
                        Division?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Oh, it was about 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So during the negotiations of the LTA in 1975, what was
                        your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Well, I was branch chief in the grain division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Clancy Jean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clancy Jean, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yeah, and so from that point on Russia was a dominant factor in the
                    grain division's work. I mean I remember going to an FAO meeting way back in
                    1968 and it was the first one I went to, because Bill Starkey who always went
                    couldn't make that one, and I introduced to them the idea of looking at
                    self-sufficiency as a measure of trends in the country's position on trade and
                    at a country's stocks-use ratio as a measure of adequacy of excess of supply.
                    Stocks-to-use ratio became very popular among the FAO types and even among the
                    common market types later on for looking at instability issues. So Russia
                    dominated the scene in the 1970s for us in the grain division.</p>
                <p>And in January of 1980 I remember having an invitation to a party at the Russian
                    embassy, it was a party January 4, 1980, and the invitation said “come to a
                    friendly party.” And those were the days, Allan, when the only people on the
                    Russian side that turned up were KGB guys, you know, supposedly they were trade
                    reps or something but they were all KGB, some were friendly, very articulate and
                    fun. Anyway, it was a friendly party and I was looking forward to going because
                    I'd been going to those kinds of parties all through the 1970s with the grain
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>Except that about 4 o'clock that afternoon after having spent all day in the Old
                    Executive Office Building, sitting on the outside of a room where Howard Hjort
                    and Dawson Ahalt were engaged in fights with other agencies about how damaging
                    an embargo would be to the USSR, and to the USA, and whether an embargo could be
                    made effective or whether the Soviets would get around it. They spent that whole
                    day arguing this.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>But at 4 o'clock we all emerged from the Old Executive Office Building and went
                    back to USDA and my instructions were to go back to my desk and call the
                    presidents of all the grain companies and tell them that the 25 million tons of
                    contracts they had signed in recent days were all going to be nullified and
                    would they please come to a meeting tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock in the ag
                    secretary's office. You can imagine the stunned silences I got when I made those
                    phone calls. I guess some of them had an inkling that something like that could
                    happen but it just happened that during that time the Russians bought a
                    tremendous amount of grain that they were being an increasing problem for us
                    foreign policy-wise and we decided to lower the boom on them vis-�-vis
                    Afghanistan and so the embargo. I didn't get to my party. (laughter) You know
                    what, months later I looked for that invitation because I thought that was worth
                    framing, you know, friendly party on the very day. Allan, you remember the mess
                    my desk always was?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Well that's probably why I never found that invitation. I know I kept
                    it; I couldn't find it. (laughter)</p>
                <p>Okay, so the embargo came and the first thing we did was start making excuses for
                    it and of course before long there was a change in administration and the new
                    people wanted to get rid of it right away, and so that was a happy job for us in
                    the grain division, to help show it wasn't working and show how wonderful it
                    would be if trade could be opened back up. So it didn't take long at all, I
                    think April, after the new administration came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been then April of 1981 then, after Jack
                        Block came in as secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Right, right. We fixed up all the big charts that Jack Block took up on
                    the Hill and showed and it was over and done. But soon after the embargo before
                    the change of administrations, there began to be this concern about China. So
                    then it was decided to make sure while we're at it to keep our house in order by
                    having one of these agreements with China because they are starting to look like
                    they'd be a big player. So at that stage for the grain division it began to be
                    both China and Russia. We did the same thing, you know, we jumped on a plane
                    with Tom Saylor and a couple of guys from State Department and we sat in a
                    Japanese inn near Tokyo airport with our kimonos on and we drafted the Chinese
                    grain agreement. (laughter) See we did that one on the way, it was so sudden we
                    didn't have a chance to do anything at home. And we got there and they basically
                    said this looks good, it makes sense and I think that one was buttoned up very
                    quickly, maybe we had senior people come for a signing ceremony and that began a
                    round of regular consultations with China as well. The next big chapter was the
                    EEP, Allan, and that started in 1985.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Senator Bob Dole who kind of initiated that
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Well, yes, but it was also a guy by the name of Martin Sorkin. Martin
                    was a long time consultant in the Washington for ADM, but in his earlier life he
                    had worked as right-hand-man to Ag Secretary Ezra Benson, and also had
                    experiences on Capitol Hill. Martin provided ideas and inspiration over many,
                    many years to many Congressional people, senior sub-cabinet people in USDA, and
                    to the lobbying community. He was as important as any under secretary USDA ever
                    haexcept he lasted 40 years. (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the instigator then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: He was the prime source of the idea of getting tough once more on
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole idea was to hit back at the European export
                        restitutions, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to tell you, I remember when we were “eeping” rice
                        into Turkey and I was the agricultural trade officer in Istanbul, one of my
                        jobs was to find out how much the export restitutions were for baldo rice
                        out of Italy. And I would go talk to the traders in Istanbul, find that out,
                        phone that back in to the grain division to Cindy Tough and the next thing
                        you know we would be “eeping” rice into Turkey at a couple of notches below
                        what the Europeans were offering.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Well, you know, having the EEP mandate dumped in our laps in the grain
                    division was an extraordinary coincidence because we had all the experience of
                    working with the who's who of both grain trade and government grains people
                    around the world, and the various grain agreements, so we were able to hit the
                    ground running. Actually, it all began with a special sale of flour to Egypt in
                    1984; Mel Sims, the USDA general sales manager, and Dick Smith the FAS
                    administrator, and three or four others went over to Egypt. And once again we
                    drafted it in a big hurry and even on the plane were completing the proposal. It
                    involved a massive sale of US flour at a heavily subsidized price to Egypt, the
                    world's largest flour importer; it was intended to hit the Europeans hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: It worked extremely well. The flour industry was ecstatic. But it was
                    really the start of the EEP idea, because people thought wow, the mechanism of
                    this works pretty good. You determine the price and terms at which the ag
                    product has to sell in order to be competitive with the subsidized European
                    flour, and then you invite the trade to bid to determine who can carry out that
                    sale for the least subsidy. This flour sale agreement then became a model for
                    things to come. Soon after, when Martin Sorkin and Bob Dole had their idea
                    about, hey let's do this in a big way, we were ready.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the mechanism already in place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: We had a workable concept. And so all we had to do was to develop the
                    mechanism and structure to go along with it. We put a little team together and
                    developed a system for reporting on competitive prices overseas. The program
                    worked well, and kept us busy for 10 years after which then the war with Europe
                    over grain finally ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We got into the agriculture agreement and the WTO and
                        started making some headway finally on at least getting agricultural trade
                        liberalization on the agenda, I mean, it had not really been on the agenda
                        until 1995.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: It was always on the agenda, but little or nothing was ever conceded by
                    the EU until 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know how much progress we made since then but at
                        least have got some caps in place and domestic support limits and things
                        like that. And can you maybe talk about that, I mean that sort of sea change
                        that took place in thinking, that in 1985 we were only thinking of taking on
                        the Europeans one-on-one and then 10 years later the landscape changed, and
                        how had it changed, and from your perspective what really were the big
                        differences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Well, I think by the early 1990s there had been a continued growth in
                    exports of value added things and so that began to take the center stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So grains were relatively less crucial, they were
                        important but they were not the only game in town really.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Right, well and you had after all the Europeans, their self-sufficiency
                    did not stay at 88%, it went to 125% or whatever, and even though there was a
                    great deal of competition throughout the 1990s there still was a lot of optimism
                    for future growth potential for the grain exports worldwide, such as to China.
                    But, I think the growing strength and optimism in the value added sector of US
                    ag exports was the big beneficiary of the grain subsidy war with Europe. There
                    came a lot of push for trade liberalization in items other than the bulk
                    commodities. The last stage of my experience in USDA was totally dominated by
                    the EEP and when we reached a point where that program ran out of gas, it was
                    about the time that I decided to retire. I could not imagine where bulk
                    commodity exports would go after that and I was already four or five years past
                    eligibility for retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: In 1994. The grain agreements with Russia ended in 1990 and the Chinese
                    shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course Russia dried up as a commercial buyer of
                        grain at that point you know, with the 1991 revolution Russia kind of
                        disappeared as a major market; so that era came to an abrupt halt, they
                        became a food aid beneficiary after that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Right. You know after that even with China, the big news became the oil
                    seed sector, soybeans and meal. They were enjoying much bigger growth than the
                    grains. So you know in retrospect that was just how it worked out; my part was
                    ending as were many of the things that had been going on up to that time.</p>
                <p>I can't really add any more except that the FAS was a fabulous experience and it
                    was a great community of people, still is I'm sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess just one question, if I could ask you to explore a
                        little bit is, over your career in the grain division starting out as a
                        junior analyst and then many years as the director, you saw, you were a
                        witness to the shift away from state trading in grains and most of our
                        trading partners to privatization of grain trade, could you talk about that,
                        how that came about and what you saw as kind of the impact of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Out of the Russian grain agreement experience, strange as it sounds,
                    even though we had the mechanism to supervise and limit if necessary the huge
                    volumes of trade that might otherwise be sudden and unannounced and
                    market-disruptive, even though we had that mechanism in place, out of that
                    experience came a realization to producers, governments, and end-users of the
                    basic commodities, that the market works better than government controls, even
                    for basic commodities where there had long been a fear that if you just happened
                    to have the wrong kind of drought there would be massive starvation or at least
                    great harm to people in poor countries that are deficient in these basic
                    commodities. Until then, there was always a fear that the international flow of
                    grain was not smooth enough to allow it to go to the places that needed it in
                    times of short supply and very high prices. There was a suspicion the price
                    mechanisms and the trade mechanisms didn't work well enough and so you had to
                    have supplementary government measures. There was all through that period of the
                    1960s and 1970s, there was still that concern with basic commodities, that they
                    were too critical, and that some countries would not be able to cope with sudden
                    surprises and maybe masses would get hurt. By the mid-1980s we'd had enough
                    experience with really huge quantities with trade with Russia, sometimes
                    occurring when the crop was looking short, that the entire world grain community
                    began to have the confidence that the international price mechanism has matured
                    to the point where it will serve best of all at the international level, just as
                    it does at the national level.</p>
                <p>And so the idea of global privatization began to be discussed, and we who had
                    gone through the 1960-1990 period started using every opportunity to talk about
                    how one really doesn't need government entities to do the importing and
                    exporting, even at times when commodity supplies become short. You can rely on
                    the market mechanisyou know, it doesn't matter if you are a big importing
                    country, heavily dependent on imports. You could still relax because the global
                    mechanism now works and you will get your grain when you need it. Privatization
                    of world grain trade caught on pretty fast; by all means it wasn't just our
                    government touting it; the private sector around the world quickly got on that
                    bandwagon too. So it was accomplished within a span of five to ten years,
                    starting in the late 1980s and extending to the mid-1990s that the extent of
                    privatization and international sale and purchasing of grain was just turned
                    upside down, I mean you still had a Canadian Wheat Board and an Australian Wheat
                    Board but very little else, even in Russia and China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the Australian Wheat Board is a shadow of what it once
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Oh yes, and Argentina during that time changed and well, Russia itself.
                    But so many of the other countries in various ways privatized the handling of
                    these basic commodities so governments faded out. For the first time in ht
                    history of man, I think, governments almost everywhere encouraged that to
                    happen. And indeed history has since then shown that you know, people will take
                    care of keeping adequate reserve stocks as individual players in the world
                    market, and so it all works out, even when you have a crop shortfall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NOVOTNY: Yes. In many ways, I feel that the experiences and outcomes we saw at
                    the global level for grains also opened the door wider than ever before for
                    globalizatioand more lowering of trade barrierfor many other commodities and
                    even non-agricultural goodbetween 1995 and 2005. The world was able to see for
                    the first time that markets work very well at the global level for all kinds of
                    things.</p>
