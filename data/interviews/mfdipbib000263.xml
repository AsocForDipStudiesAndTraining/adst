                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 30, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 2001 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is May 30, 1997. This is an interview with Stephen F. Dachi. This is
                    being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I
                    am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</p>
                <p>To begin at the beginning, could you tell me when and where you werborn and
                    something about your family?</p>
                <p>DACHI: I was born in 1933 in Hungary. My father was a dentist. My mother was a
                    physician. They both died when I was three years old in 1936, before the war. My
                    grandparents “inherited me.” They happened to live in Romania. So, I went there
                    just before the Germans marched into Austria, which is my first memory of
                    arriving in Timisoara to live with my grandparents. Then I spent World War II
                    there with them trying to survive. After the war, in 1948, an uncle and aunt who
                    had gone to Canada before the war brought me out there.</p>
                <p>Q: During the war, what went on then in Romania, particularly as a Hungarian?
                    There was a massive change of borders and everything else at that time. Did you
                    get caught in that?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Very definitely, both that and the Holocaust. It has always been hell for
                    Hungarians living in Romania. Kids would curse and harass us if they overheard
                    us speaking Hungarian in the street. They used to throw stones at me when I came
                    out of the house to walk to school. Romanian teachers would make us stand in
                    front of the class, ask impossible questions and taunt, ridicule or slap us
                    around in front of classmates. There was nothing terribly subtle about any of
                    it. Our landlord in the three-unit house we lived in had a heavily reinforced
                    bomb shelter in the basement, but during the nightly air raids we were not
                    allowed in there and had to seek shelter in a crudely dug ditch covered with
                    plywood in the back yard instead.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was not Jewish, but there were lots of non-Jewish people getting caught up in
                    the holocaust too. First of all, German troops came through there periodically
                    on the way east and would randomly round up people who would disappear and never
                    be heard from again. My grandparents were so worried about it that, even though
                    they had a young grandchild, they had a cyanide capsule on their night table
                    every night. They told me that they would be glad to raise me, but they were not
                    going to allow themselves to be taken away alive. They were ready to take that
                    capsule if that dreaded knock on the door came in the middle of the night. So,
                    those were some of the factors that made life perilous.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, there was the war itself. The allies were bombing the Ploesti
                    oil fields in Romania a few hundred miles to the east of us and we were on the
                    flight path.. Also, there were a lot of overflights to airdrop supplies to Tito,
                    who was head of the Yugoslav Partisans. So, one of my most vivid memories from
                    the war is having to get up almost every night in the middle of the night when
                    the sirens blew and running down into that shelter in the backyard, even though
                    those were just overflights. We weren't actually bombed until later.</p>
                <p>Our house finally was hit by a bomb in 1944, so we lived sort of a gypsy life for
                    a while after that. Then the so-called Soviet liberators arrived. In 1944, I was
                    11 years old. At that time Romania had already been taken over by the Soviet
                    troops, but the German army still held all of Hungary and the decisive siege of
                    Budapest hadn't taken place yet. My grandparents had acquired a Romanian
                    passport, but I was still a Hungarian citizen. Q: What were your grandparents'
                    profession?</p>
                <p>DACHI: My grandfather had a printing shop. My grandmother was bustaking care of
                    the house and raising me.</p>
                <p>Sometime in early 1944, a Russian soldier came to the house one day and announced
                    that he was taking me away because I was ostensibly an enemy alien. I remember
                    him telling my grandmother to give me a heavy coat because I was going away
                    somewhere where it was cold. She wouldn't give me a coat because she thought the
                    soldier wouldn't take me if I didn't have a coat. Wrong. I was taken to a police
                    station with a bunch of other people who had been rounded up, many of whom I
                    knew. As we huddled there on the floor a German bombing raid began, and we found
                    ourselves in the epicenter of it. Bombs were dropping literally all around us.
                    The walls were crumbling. Everybody was hiding under a table or someplace. I was
                    only 11 years old. I saw the grillwork on a window bend apart from the pressure
                    of a bomb blast. Being too young to way the risks, I decided to try and escape.
                    So, I climbed out the window and ran down the street. Craters were opening up
                    all around me as more bombs kept falling. Somehow, I managed to reach a
                    synagogue where I was taken in and sheltered by a rabbi.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>While the Germans were there, a lot of Romanians protected Jews. So, many Jews
                    were now anxious to pay back the favor. The rabbi hid me out for a few days. No
                    one I saw in that police station ever was seen alive again. Afterwards, I went
                    back home swearing that they would never find me or take me again. We always had
                    an escape path charted out in case a soldier came through the front door again.
                    But none ever did. Even now, more than fifty years later, when I go to a
                    restaurant I sit with my back against the wall facing the door, subconsciously I
                    suppose ready to make an escape through the kitchen if the need arose. So, there
                    were lots of dangerous and deadly moments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Romania in 1948. Did you run afoul of the
                        Soviets aall again? How was school at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Well, from the end of the war until about 1947, roughly two years, not
                    unlike some other East European countries, there was sort of a not fully Soviet
                    dominated transitional regime. King Michael, for example, was still briefly
                    there on his throne. A socialist politician by the name of Petru Groza became
                    Prime Minister, heading what was called a communist-front regime. Shortly
                    thereafter, the Soviets took over total control and the two top communist,
                    Moscow-installed puppet leaders were Ana Pauker and Ion Luca. I remember having
                    to go from school with all my schoolmates as a little Red Pioneer and march in
                    parades chanting slogans for communism and carrying portraits of Marx, Engels,
                    Lenin, and Stalin.</p>
                <p>About that time, my uncle and aunt got us immigrant visas to Canada. We spent
                    nine or ten months going through the process of having to pay all the bribes and
                    getting all the papers so we could get out. Luckily, there were still enough
                    bureaucrats left over from the old days so you could do that. You had to have a
                    certificate attesting from some local authority that you were without any
                    visible means of support. You had to prove that you had no assets at all in
                    order to qualify for a passport. An inspector came to the house. He looked
                    around and saw our furniture and said, “That's nice furniture.” We said, “Well,
                    consider that a gift.” He said, “Oh, thank you very much.” He proceeded to
                    identify everything else we had by way of possessions. Then, he said,
                    “Considering that as a gift, you really don't have anything, so you qualify for
                    an exit permit.” My grandfather had saved dollar bills under the mattress
                    through the war. We managed to keep those out of sight. So, we just had these
                    dollar bills. As long as they lasted, we were going to be okay. As we ran out of
                    them, there was nothing left.</p>
                <p>We couldn't get out and travel together because my grandmother had a Romanian
                    passport and mine was Hungarian. (My grandfather died of natural causes the year
                    before). The lengthy and complicated processes to obtain exit visas were
                    different for the two nationalities, and the timing of the two could not be
                    coordinated. And, once you got that coveted exit visa, you only had about
                    two-three weeks to get out before it expired. So, I traveled alone to Canada. My
                    grandmother couldn't get her papers in order at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Our case was further complicated by the fact that there was no Canadian Embassy
                    in Romania. We had to present ourselves in Rome to receive the immigrant visa
                    and that required another cumbersome process of obtaining an Italian transit
                    visa in Bucharest during that narrow window while the exit visa was valid. To
                    make matters even harder, there was only an occasional ship leaving Romania via
                    the Black Sea, there were no airline flights and going by train would have
                    required another couple of transit visas, an impossible task in the time
                    available.</p>
                <p>I was lucky to get the Italian visa. Better still, there was an old cruise ship
                    that happened to be leaving for Naples from Constanta, which is Romania's port
                    on the Black Sea. It was leaving at about the right time. I somehow managed to
                    get a ticket and get on that ship. I had to travel by myself, and my grandmother
                    stayed behind. (She was able to follow me about three months later). There were
                    maybe 15 passengers on that ship that had room for 300. That goes to show you
                    how few people were still managing to leave the country by then. I got off the
                    ship iNaples.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get to Canada? How did you get a visa from
                        thCanadians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: My uncle and aunt in Vancouver, British Columbia, were able to get one of
                    those refugee or displaced person visas for us, but you had to go to Rome or
                    someplace where they had a Canadian embassy to pass a physical. I had had
                    tuberculosis when I was a child. We were kind of worried about that, but when I
                    got to Rome they issued me the visa.</p>
                <p>My uncle had a friend in Italy, a business associate, who picked me up in Naples
                    and looked after me in Rome for about a month until I got all the Canadian
                    requirements satisfied. Then I was one of the early air travelers on a TWA
                    Constellation flying from Rome to Gander, Newfoundland, a territory which did
                    not join Canada until the following year. That is as far as those planes could
                    fly in those days, via Zurich, Switzerland and Shannon, Ireland, the big jumping
                    off point to North America back then.</p>
                <p>From Gander, I took another plane to Montreal. Another friend picked me up there
                    and put me on a train to Vancouver. I had lots of strange little things happen
                    to me, not speaking English. On the train, the porter was supposed to look after
                    me. He was a kindly man. Every evening, he would come by and give me a banana. I
                    had never seen a banana before. I didn't know what to do with it. I couldn't
                    bite through the skin. It seemed awfully chewy. So, as soon as he would
                    disappear, I would throw it out the window. That was just one of several funny
                    experiences I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you speak any English?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DACHI: No, I didn't. I grew up multi-lingual, first of all because, there was a
                    tradition in our family that the men always spoke Hungarian to their children
                    and the women spoke German. So, they raised you bilingual. Then, of course, we
                    lived in Romania, so German, Hungarian, and Romanian were the first three. Then
                    you go to school and pretty soon you're taking Latin and French and then, later,
                    Russian. So, I had all of that in school and before school. But not English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did the whole nine yards. You were about 15 by the
                        timyou went to Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes. I arrived there when I was 15. By then, I had picked up a little
                    rudimentary English. My uncle believed in the total immersion method for
                    learning English. He said, “Just go to school.” They thrust me into the
                    sophomore year at a regular public high school the week after I got there.
                    Needless to say, not speaking English, I was totally at sea. In Romania, I had
                    gone to this Catholic, Piarist Order school. The academic standards there were a
                    lot stricter and higher. As far as subject matter was concerned, I didn't learn
                    anything new in Vancouver for at least three years. The problem was the
                    language. The first semester, I took Latin and French, so there would be at
                    least two courses I could pass. By the second semester, I was able to pass math.
                    In the second year, I started getting the hang of it and passed the other
                    courses where you had to know English.</p>
                <p>My uncle was a successful self-made businessman and didn't have much patience
                    with education. He said, “Now that you have the language, you have to get caught
                    up, you have to move faster.” So, I started simultaneously going to night
                    school. In Canada you can do that for the senior year in high school and the
                    first year of college, which they call grade 13. I went to both day and night
                    school and I would take government exams for the night courses. In the end, I
                    finished the equivalent of my first year in college while still in my senior
                    year in high school, finishing up the whole thing one year earlier than I would
                    have graduated from high school normally. I was ready to start out as a
                    sophomore in college.</p>

                <p>DACHI: I wanted to go to college, but my uncle felt that that was a waste of
                    time, because people who had “real world” skills should go directly into
                    business, not college. I still wanted to go to college, so I told him that I
                    wanted to be a dentist. I said, “That takes less time than medicine, and
                    dentists earn good money right away. If you lend me the money, I will pay you
                    back within three years of graduation.” So, I chose my college path based on
                    what I thought were the only grounds on which my uncle would lend me the money
                    to go to college.So, I went to the University of British Columbia for one year.
                    In those days you could apply for dental school with only two years of
                    pre-dental. They preferred a B.A., but because of the pressures from my uncle I
                    didn't have that option. I was 18 years old and I was half way through my first
                    year at the university when I applied to the University of Oregon Dental School.
                    I went down there for an interview and the man said, “Well, your grades are all
                    pretty good, but you're just a child. You're only 18 years old and you have to
                    be mature to go to professional school. I don't see what grounds you have for
                    seeking admission at 18.” I told him the story of my life during the war, the
                    Russians, the Germans, and, that all of that time, I was taking care of my
                    grandparents, too, who were pretty old. After he heard that story, he said,
                    “Well, I guess you have some compensatory real life education there.” So, I was
                    accepted. As a result, I was barely 23 years old when I became a doctor of
                    dental medicine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went through the University of Oregon Dental
                        School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. I only went to college one year. I already had some credits from
                    high school. I went to college one year and then went to dental school. In 1956,
                    I was finished. I was a dentist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you start doing dentistry?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DACHI: As I was going through dental school, it was apparent that this was not
                    the thing for me. I wasn't terribly attracted to it. So, I had already started
                    to look for ways to move on. Instead of going into dental practice, I applied
                    for a one-year hospital internship, which is required for physicians, but very
                    unusual for dentists. I got accepted to an internship at the Albert Einstein
                    Medical Center in Philadelphia and spent a year there. After that, I was still
                    looking for a way to prolong my studies. In the meantime, my uncle was
                    pressuring me to pay him back. I managed to slip out from under that. I got an
                    American Cancer Society fellowship to study for a year at the University of
                    Pennsylvania Graduate School of Medicine. I studied pathology. After that, I
                    ended up at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis, where I got a
                    graduate degree in pathology and biochemistry. By 1961, after five years of
                    being a professional graduate student, I had repaid about half of what I had
                    borrowed. My uncle realized that he was never going to get paid back in full. He
                    was a very wealthy man. He called me over and said, “All right, I'm getting old
                    and making out my latest will. You don't have to pay me back the rest of what
                    you owe, but you're getting nothing more from my will.” I said, “Fine. Thank you
                    very much.” He left several million dollars to everybody else. I got nothing,
                    but that was fine with me. He helped me get my education, which was worth just
                    as much to me or more.</p>
                <p>Then in 1961, after having gone to school all these years, a colleague I had met
                    at the University of Pennsylvania was named dean of what was going to be a brand
                    new University of Kentucky Medical Center with a medical school and dental
                    school in Lexington. He recruited me to be one of four colleagues to join him in
                    being the founders of the College of Dentistry. We started out in a corn field
                    and went about the task of building a new university medical center and dental
                    school. We were all in our late 20s or early 30s. In 1961, I was 28 years old.
                    The first day, we went into a little room about the size of the one we're in
                    now. The five of us starting talking about how you set up a new, in our case,
                    college of dentistry. This was really a crucial part of my life. This dean was
                    saying that the way to start something new was not to see what everyone else had
                    done over the previous 60 years and copy it, but to develop a totally new
                    concept or vision for the future.</p>
                <p>The question was, what was health care delivery likely to be by the end of the
                    century. We obviously had no way of imagining exactly what we now in 1997 are
                    seeing. Nevertheless, we tried to define the mentality of the health care
                    professional and his responsibilities toward the community 40 or 50 years down
                    the road, as far as we were able to visualize it. Then we asked ourselves what
                    kind of an educational environment we would have to create in order to foster
                    that kind of mentality, the basic parts of which are that life is a process of
                    continuous learning, that there is no such thing as terminal education, that if
                    you think you have all the answers, it's because you have failed to keep up with
                    all the questions, concepts that today are much more common than they were back
                    then. Nowadays you hear them at commencement addresses 600 times a year. In
                    those days, they were quite innovative. But, they were true then and are still
                    true now.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So, we basically set up a radically innovative curriculum in which we introduced
                    concepts like interdisciplinary teaching, a lot of teaching of health care in
                    the community instead of within the walls of the university, things that today
                    are well accepted. We were truly pioneers in the idea of training health care
                    personnel for community service. In the meantime, we built... It sounds funny to
                    say we built a $27 million medical center. At that time, that was a lavishly
                    rich thing. We got it equipped. We recruited the faculty and the first class of
                    students who started the program. One of the jobs I had was director of
                    continuing education for dentists in a state where there were no continuing
                    education courses available up to that point.</p>
                <p>In spite of a lot of skepticism from others in the establishment about doing all
                    that curriculum innovation and risk not getting the school accredited, we put it
                    into practice and encountered remarkably few problems with it. We devised a
                    program that became a real beacon of new ideas and, most importantly, was the
                    first step that got us away from the idea that a dentist or a doctor lives in
                    the cocoon of his private office, only takes care of people who can afford to
                    seek him out, gets paid, gets rich and lives happily ever after. We said that
                    there is a community, there are all the other needy people, there is public
                    health, public education, prevention, and they are all integral parts of a
                    health professional's responsibility. We were wrestling with how you formally
                    inculcate this professional with a social consciousness and service to the
                    community as a whole. We managed to find the way to do it.</p>
                <p>So, that attracted a lot of attention. Not surprisingly, much of the interest
                    came from developing countries in Latin America and Asia. They had always looked
                    at the United States as a place that took care of the people who had money and
                    could afford to get the finest technical health care in the world. But they felt
                    with some justification that there was no concern about public health, about the
                    community, about the poor, etc. So, since we had consciously, deliberately,
                    structured the program for that very purpose, there was tremendous interest in
                    the developing world. Through the Pan American Health Organization, we started
                    getting a stream of delegations of foreign visitors, deans and professors, to
                    look at what we were doing. There were only a few of us there, although by that
                    time, we had a somewhat larger faculty.</p>
                <p>I was the guy who spoke all these languages. So, the dean asked me to sort of
                    become the host and guide for all the foreign delegations. After a while, the
                    traffic got so bad that I had to develop a whole pre-recorded program for
                    foreigners so that they wouldn't all want to interview every faculty member in
                    person. That would have taken up too much of their time. One of our colleagues
                    was a pioneer in audio visual educational technology, as it was called at the
                    time. (The term media was born later). We put everybody on tape so that a
                    visitor could come in and spend a few days getting acquainted with everybody and
                    everything we were doing in an audio visual center, and then just make
                    appointments with human beings for the follow-up questions. I was in charge of
                    that. I was hosting them. I was bringing in some foreign ambassadors from
                    Washington also, to give speeches and internationalize the thing. We were
                    capitalizing on something that we didn't realize at the beginning that we were
                    even getting into.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>These things led to my becoming a consultant to the Pan American Health
                    Organization. For example, I was one of the consultants for the founding of a
                    new school of dentistry in Panama. I also consulted in Colombia. I had a
                    Fulbright professorship in Ecuador one summer. I spent one summer on the
                    hospital ship “Hope” in Guinea. I traveled through Africa. Strange as it may
                    seem, this complex of things that I'm describing here gradually led me to the
                    Foreign Service through a growing interest in international affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: Was the United States sort of the place where medical people went, not just
                    people getting treatment, but doctors, professional people in the medical world
                    during this period? We're talking about the 1960s.</p>
                <p>DACHI: The United States was and still is, I am speaking here of dentistry, the
                    unquestioned leader in the world, particularly on the technical side. It no
                    longer is, but it was somewhat behind at that time in both the biological side
                    and the social, humanistic side. So, people who came here back then came because
                    they were wanting to learn how to do better gold caps and better porcelain caps,
                    or better dentures. They did not look to the United States for solutions for
                    their societies and communities, for how to devise a better health care system
                    because there wasn't much emphasis here on care for those who couldn't afford it
                    on a private basis.</p>
                <p>Q: You were at the University of Kentucky, in the heart of Appalachia, which was
                    a prime concern for the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. I suppose that a
                    state university would look towards this kind of health care much more than a
                    place such as New York where they may have had the same problems off somewhere
                    else, but they were immersed in the big city atmosphere and money. I would think
                    there would be a different outlook.</p>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely, but this is sort of a chicken and egg thing. The situation
                    there demanded this kind of approach, but it wasn't mandated to us. We were the
                    ones who came to the conclusion that the situation called for it. We set out to
                    create it because we felt that this was important for the United States, for
                    Kentucky and to the health care profession. The Governor of Kentucky at the
                    time, Albert B. “Happy” Chandler, who became famous for a variety of reasons,
                    including being commissioner of baseball, gave us the charter for this school.
                    He said, “Kentucky is 47th in education in this country. I am going to give you
                    guys everything you need to make Kentucky number one. I am not going to tell you
                    what to do. I just want us to go from the worst to the best and you're going to
                    get everything you need to get there.” He was as good as his word. That
                    university for about eight years got absolutely premium support. We were able to
                    put our thinking and plans into effect virtually unimpeded by any budgetary or
                    other political constraints.</p>
                <p>Q: How did this metamorphosis from a dental practitioner/administrator into the
                    Foreign Service occur? We've got you getting all sorts of exposure, but there is
                    a certain point where you have to jump into the pool.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DACHI: Right. The effective turn came in 1965 when I went to Guinea on the
                    hospital ship. I was there for two months as a volunteer on that ship.</p>
                <p>Q: For the record, the hospital ship Hope is a ship that would anchor off various
                    underdeveloped places with volunteer doctors and do some work, but mainly it was
                    more teaching.</p>
                <p>DACHI: We had a hospital on board. We got to Guinea. In Guinea, there were no
                    graduate dentists whatsoever. They had a few sort of village technicians who
                    attended to the local population, but they had a large expatriate community and
                    a diplomatic community for whom that was not acceptable. They would all have to
                    fly to some European capital to see a dentist. During the day, we were dealing
                    with Guineans. Teaching was less than ideal because there weren't many people
                    there to teach, but we were caring for people. At night, we could do anything we
                    wanted. There was tremendous pressure on us from people in town, expatriates,
                    French teachers, ambassadors, and so on, to take care of some of their dental
                    problems because, otherwise, they had to go to Paris. So, most of the doctors on
                    the ship did a little bit of moonlighting. My first exposure to this was when
                    the Lebanese ambassador needed a root canal. I thought, “Oh, the Lebanese
                    ambassador. That sounds very exciting.” I said, “I'll be thrilled to do his root
                    canal.” So, I did. Of course, we could not and did not accept any payments, so
                    the only way he could reciprocate was to invite me to one of his diplomatic
                    dinners. I went there and was absolutely thrilled by what I saw. I thought, “Oh
                    boy, this is for me.”</p>
                <p>That led me to accept other expatriates for dental treatment, including a
                    Senegalese diplomat who paid me back not by inviting me to dinner, but by taking
                    me throughout Guinea to visit his Senegalese constituents. I got into villages
                    and ordinary homes in Guinea in a way I could have never imagined. I got exposed
                    to the cultural and social dimensions of a world that was totally new to me,
                    because this Senegalese guy just took me around like a brother and took me into
                    all kinds of homes and villages. That was one thing.</p>
                <p>There were two others. When we first arrived, we were invited as the new doctors
                    on board (Every two months, there was a new batch) to have a briefing at the
                    American Ambassador's residence. The ambassador was a Kennedy appointee. I
                    remember that as a very exciting thing. We went to the embassy and he gave us a
                    briefing, the kind of briefing that thousands of ambassadors have given in
                    thousands of places on countless occasions. To me at the time, I thought that
                    was the most interesting and exciting thing I had ever experienced. Here was a
                    man who had this overview of the country and the political situation. I was just
                    totally taken by this. I said, “Wow!” That just blew me away.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Then, the third thing was that I became exposed to the Peace Corps. I saw some of
                    the things that Peace Corps volunteers were doing. So, for these three different
                    reasons, this was the actual tangible beginning. I said, “I've got to find a way
                    to get into this thing. This is just so exciting, so interesting, so
                    intellectually stimulating.” That briefing by the U.S. Ambassador was absolutely
                    the most crucial experience of my professional life up to that time. I began to
                    think that, because of my international dental experience, maybe I could somehow
                    transition into the foreign service.</p>
                <p>It was while I was on the ship that I got a call from the State Department to see
                    if I was interested in being a Fulbright professor of dentistry in Ecuador the
                    following summer. I said, “Yes.” I went back to Lexington. I had about 10 months
                    before going to Ecuador. I decided to teach myself Spanish, which I did. I never
                    had a teacher, but because of all these other languages I already had, I managed
                    to make a good beginning on my own. I started reading the Spanish-language
                    Ecuadorean newspapers. Just like in Guinea, I became fascinated by the politics
                    of Ecuador. You can see it developing. The summer of 1966 I went down there. I
                    was exposed to the consulate, and the Peace Corps. I made enough progress with
                    the language that I ended up giving all the lectures in Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: In Guayaquil and, briefly in Quito. I also stopped in Guatemala and Costa
                    Rica on the way down to visit some of my former colleagues who had come to see
                    me in Kentucky. When I got to Guatemala, the first place I set foot in Latin
                    America, they had me lined up to teach a two-day seminar. This was a not
                    unusual, I used to do a lot of lecturing at dental meetings in the U.S. So, my
                    host said, “How are you going to do this?” I said, “I am going to do it in
                    Spanish.” He was absolutely astonished because he knew me from graduate school
                    when I didn't speak a word of Spanish. Anyway, I went down there and did the
                    whole thing in Spanish. It's easier to give a lecture in Spanish than it is to
                    have a conversation, because during a lecture the people don't speak back to
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're in control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: In control of the vocabulary. I needed an interpreter fothe question and
                    answer period.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>When I returned from Ecuador, I decided I had to do something about finding a way
                    to a career change. In 1966, the first class had graduated in Kentucky. I had
                    become a full professor. I had published 35 papers in the scientific literature
                    and had written parts of a book. I said, “What am I going to do now? I am 33
                    years old.” After doing this in Kentucky, I didn't know what else I was going to
                    do in dental education. So, I decided I was going to attempt this
                    transition.</p>
                <p>I started looking into it. But, as you know very well, it's not so easy. I don't
                    remember precisely how, but I did get to have a visit with someone at AID, which
                    I thought might be a logical thing, what with my experience in the health area.
                    But the AID person did not think so. My interviewer at the State Department was
                    greatly amused by the thought that a dentist would have pretensions of entering
                    the Foreign Service. So, I struck out there too. But I worked on the Peace Corps
                    thing. They were looking for short-time people. I said, “This may be the
                    way.”</p>
                <p>The way the Peace Corps took people in, you went to the Personnel Department and
                    they did a routine screening. If they thought you had potential, they would
                    refer you to a desk officer for a more substantive interview. There wasn't an
                    exam or anything. I had a terribly hard time with the personnel officer, who
                    just kept saying, “I don't know what makes you think...” In this country, a
                    dentist was considered a technician. In Latin America, where the number of
                    educated people is so small, anyone with a university education has more
                    standing, and in Europe, where dentists usually have to have a medical degree in
                    parallel with their dental degree, they also have more standing... But in the
                    United States, no one could imagine a dentist as being anything other than
                    somebody who pulled teeth or made dentures. He kept bugging me about it. I kept
                    saying, “Languages, languages.”</p>
                <p>So, he decided to fix my wagon. He was going to get me an interview with the
                    Colombian desk officer who was a Mexican-American. Unbeknownst to me, he called
                    her up and said, “Interview this candidate and do it in Spanish. This guy has
                    the temerity to suggest that he speaks good Spanish.” I walked into her office
                    and she started speaking Spanish to me. I spoke Spanish back. Within three
                    minutes, I was being recruited as opposed to seeking entry, because by that time
                    I was a 5/5 [completely fluent] in Spanish. So, that completed the
                    transition.</p>
                <p>I started out as deputy country director of the Peace Corps in Colombia. Two
                    years later, I became country director in Venezuela. Another two years later, I
                    was named country director in Brazil. During that period, I was recruited into
                    USIA. That is how the transition was consummated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the Peace Corps. You were deputy director
                        iColombia. You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DACHI: June 1967 until about January 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of preparation did the Peace Corps give
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI:. The answer to that is virtually none. I had the language. The rest was
                    sort of briefings for a couple or three weeks. But we've got to go bacOne of the
                    major experiences I had in my “transformation” from dentist to foreign service
                    officer occurred before going on my Fulbright professorship to Ecuador in the
                    summer of 1966. In those days, cultural and educational exchanges were still in
                    the State Department, as they are now going back. And there was still money.
                    They had a two-week area studies preparatory course for Fulbrighters. I went to
                    that. I remember the room. I vividly remember everything about it. Just like
                    they have now at FSI, there was a chairperson for area studies and there were a
                    lot of guest speakers. I attended the course on Latin America. I was totally
                    struck. A new world opened up for me. I learned a lot and I found it
                    tremendously interesting and stimulating. This was just so much more exciting
                    than anything I had ever done before. That was the trigger. My desire to find a
                    way into the foreign service became even stronger. I decided I just had to find
                    a way to make it happen.</p>
                <p>It was during a break at that course that one of the teachers and I had coffee in
                    the State Department cafeteria. It was he who suggested that I try to get some
                    interviews about getting into the Foreign Service if I was really that excited
                    about it. He gave me the names and whatever that led me to these interviews.
                    Every time I walk by that seminar room to this day, I think back to that crucial
                    turning point in my life. And, I must be one of the very few people on the face
                    of this earth who think of the State Department cafeteria in a positive context.
                    It was sitting there that this idea really began to germinate and take hold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Colombia in 1967. From your perspective,
                        what wathe situation in Colombia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: They were in a brief historical pause between one type of violence and
                    another. For many years, there was bitter political violence in Colombia between
                    the two parties, liberal and conservative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they the Reds and the Blues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DACHI: It was almost like the Hatfields and the McCoys, between the two principal
                    political parties, the liberals and the conservatives. A lot of people died.
                    Several months before my tour began there, there was a political accord to have
                    a coalition government and end the violence with four presidential terms
                    alternating between the two parties. I got there during the first of these
                    periods with President Carlos Lleras Restrepo. He was quite a statesman. That
                    was the launching of this brief period of political peace in Colombia.</p>
                <p>Then not too long after I left, the drug violence began, rather slowly at first.
                    But this very divisive thing where you have leftist guerrillas on the one hand
                    and the drug mafias on the other increasingly working together, that was not
                    apparent yet at the time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Peace Corps doing in the 1967-1969
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That was the peak period of its fixation on community development
                    programs. It was based on the belief that basically inexperienced but
                    well-intentioned young liberal arts graduates could go into Latin American
                    communities and take on the political establishment. The idea was to try to
                    organize communities from the ground up and find a way to bring pressure on
                    these somewhat corrupt and certainly very entrenched political powers to open up
                    the political process so that it could become more democratic and participatory.
                    That was a time when Sol Alinski, a sociologist in Chicago, was the great guru
                    of community development in third world societies, and he had a tremendous
                    impact on the Peace Corps. It was an uphill, mostly losing struggle that the
                    Peace Corps had going in dozens of countries during the Kennedy/Johnson years.
                    It was incredibly na�ve. It just didn't work. So, that was a major frustration
                    in the Peace Corps at the time, that its central theme wasn't working.</p>
                <p>The other major thing going on was the Vietnam War and the large number of
                    volunteers who were in the Peace Corps as an alternative to it. This increased
                    their zeal to try to get results in community development, to be able to show
                    the world that this was a far superior way to bring about change. It increased
                    their frustration when they failed at it. Then as the years went by, the Vietnam
                    War became an increasingly bitter and confrontational thing among Peace Corps
                    volunteers.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about Colombia first. In Colombia, when you were there, did you and
                    the Director of the Peace Corps in that country see this social revolution that
                    we were trying to promote with the Peace Corps as working? Was this a
                    frustrating thing or is it only in retrospect that you see that it wasn't
                    working?</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DACHI: It was sort of half-way between. Certainly the realization was setting in
                    that it wasn't working. But the zeal from the top was still very great. You
                    couldn't openly argue inside the Peace Corps that it was time to change
                    direction. The country director was a guy who was a particularly sensitive Latin
                    Americanist who had come from a religious background, was a former Baptist
                    minister. He was very sensitive to this. First of all, he believed very deeply
                    in the idea of community development. At the same time, he was a very sensitive
                    reader of the situation, so he also understood that it was failing. He was torn
                    very deeply by that. That is what was happening. People were torn apart
                    emotionally between the ideology and the reality.</p>
                <p>Q: You were supervising Peace Corps volunteers at this time. Can you give some
                    examples of what some of these people were trying to do in Colombia?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes. Let's say there would be a volunteer working in a village. They would
                    try to see if the mayor would fund a health care clinic for maternal and child
                    care. Or he would build more classrooms. Or, much more dangerously, they would
                    attempt to organize people to develop a viable alternative candidate to run in
                    what they thought would be an honest election against this mayor who was not
                    giving them the funds for the community health center or school. Trying to teach
                    peasants how to organize to become politically effective rather than having to
                    go and sit in the waiting room of some local chieftain and go hat in hand to ask
                    for a favor to get a health clinic. To go in there and say, “This is our right.
                    We demand it and, if you don't provide it, we're going to organize and elect
                    someone else to take your place.” This was a very American idea whose time had
                    not come there. I'm not sure it has come to this day. To think that a “gringo”
                    speaking broken Spanish, coming from a comfortable American middle class
                    neighborhood and little clue about the local culture could make this happen
                    still boggles my mind.</p>
                <p>Another big thing was agricultural cooperatives. That tends to help some people
                    move away from being sharecroppers or tenant farmers, to develop their own
                    facilities so that they could market their products independently. You need farm
                    to market roads, transportation, tractors, a lot of things. There was a big
                    program of teaching people how to organize cooperatives, how to run them, and
                    how to elect leaders of cooperatives. The idea also was that such cooperatives
                    would develop democratic political leaders. An overwhelming task in most cases
                    for a foreigner from another planet to undertake. Then unions, well, that wasn't
                    such a big thing because there was no industry there. But in Latin America, the
                    idea of having unions also goes for rural migrant workers.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously, you were working against the establishment in this. These young
                    kids were guests in the country. What about the toleration of the central
                    government and at other levels?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DACHI: The intolerance came first at the local level and worked its way up. In
                    Colombia, the central government didn't really become seized with that issue
                    until later. There were a number of countries where, from the beginning, central
                    governments would not abide this idea. In countries like Mexico and Argentina,
                    the Peace Corps was never allowed in for this very reason. In others, it was
                    eventually asked to leave early. That happened in Venezuela, Brazil, and
                    Colombia. But the intolerance originated with the entrenched powers at the local
                    level that felt threatened.</p>
                <p>There were two categories. Even in villages where they had sweet, wonderful
                    people, a Peace Corps volunteer might not be an effective community development
                    organizer for the simple reason that it's not easy to do even if all the lights
                    are green. There were a lot of people who were not able to become effective
                    enough and acted more as glorified social workers who weren't very popular and
                    welcome after they failed to produce results. If they did happen to have the
                    ability to become effective as political organizers, then they would either be
                    isolated or expelled or something would be trumped up against them. There was a
                    lot of drug use among volunteers in those days. Some mayor who wanted to get rid
                    of a kid could easily enough hang the narcotics charge around him or her and we
                    would have to remove them, put them somewhere else, or send them home. So, it
                    had a limited effectiveness.</p>
                <p>There always were, of course, many exceptions. Some volunteers would manage to
                    adapt to local conditions, help start some good projects and become very popular
                    with their local hosts. The Peace Corps always was a fertile ground for future
                    foreign service officers and other professionals, who with this international
                    experience later entered the private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of support and interest were you getting from
                        ouembassy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It was sort of a benign and somewhat affectionate, paternal kind of
                    interest on the one hand and, at the same time, an increasing nervousness that
                    the Vietnam dimension was creating and harboring some political militants who
                    were going to create problems for them. All of these issues came to a head two
                    years later in Venezuela. In Colombia, they were just being formed. These were
                    the last two years of the Johnson administration. All these things were just
                    percolating up to a crisis. There was this division of feelings in the embassy.
                    “It's a wonderful idea, it's very nice, but we don't have enough control.” First
                    of all, the Peace Corps was semi-autonomous. The Peace Corps Country Director
                    was supposed to keep the ambassador informed and to be a cooperative member of
                    the country team. He was urged to do so by the Peace Corps in Washington. But it
                    was also clear that he was not totally under the ambassador's control and had
                    his own budget. It created some friction. Many of the Peace Corps Directors were
                    a little bit anti-establishment themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>In Colombia at the time, the ambassador was a political appointee named Reynold
                    Carlson. He had been head of the Ford Foundation's development program in
                    Argentina before he came up there. He was very sympathetic to the Peace Corps
                    because he had a development orientation. He had a benign personality and was
                    content to preside over all embassy sections with a very light touch, without
                    ever trying to exercise much leadership or control. Our Peace Corps Director was
                    sort of in the middle on that. He was certainly not anti-embassy but he was not
                    pro-embassy either. There was a satisfactory modus operandi. Then there was AID
                    in the picture. There was always an argument as to whether we should tie Peace
                    Corps programs in more closely with AID, but Peace Corps policy was opposed to
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the height of the Alliance for Progress,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. But AID, particularly in Colombia, was so big and powerful at the
                    time that the head of AID was really the most dominant and influential figure in
                    that embassy, in many ways more so than the ambassador. He had so much money at
                    his disposal. The Peace Corps, even though we had one of the largest Peace Corps
                    in the world with 800-900 volunteers, from the AID Director's standpoint, was a
                    little gnat on his arm. They didn't feel that these amateurish efforts would in
                    any way compare with the major things they were doing like educational
                    curriculum and agricultural reform. In many respects, they were right. The Peace
                    Corps was in a different kind of framework. And sometimes, small could be
                    beautiful too.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression while you were there at this time of the Peace Corps
                    direction from Washington? I assume you would get people coming out.</p>
                <p>DACHI: That was the time when Jack Vaughn was Director of the Peace Corps. He was
                    very definitely what you would call a liberal democrat, a McGovern-type director
                    who had a great deal of soul and empathy and was very much seized with social
                    issues. He was very much pro-community development. He was virtually a native
                    speaker in Spanish and earlier had been a popular ambassador in Panama. He was
                    very charismatic. He followed Sergeant Shriver. He was trying to keep the
                    Kennedy flame alive. So, all the pressure at the time was very much toward
                    persisting with this thing. The rationalization was that we're trying something
                    that was sufficiently revolutionary that it was going to take some time and that
                    obviously not everyone was going to be successful, that it would take a couple
                    of decades. We would have to learn a little more about how to train volunteers
                    to do this kind of work, but we were doing fine and it would just take time
                    because it was so ambitious and so potentially change producing that you have to
                    be patient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1969, you moved to Venezuela. You were there from when
                        twhen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DACHI: From about March of 1969 to the end of 1970 as country director. That was
                    a crucial time of change for the Peace Corps. It was the beginning of the Nixon
                    administration. The Nixon administration named Joe Blatchford to be Director of
                    the Peace Corps. He had previously set up a private sector volunteer
                    organization in Venezuela called “Accion.” In Blatchford's time the Peace Corps
                    eventually was renamed “Action.” What Joe Blatchford tried to do, very much
                    consistent with the Nixon administration's view, was to move the Peace Corps
                    away from community development and this kind of social do-goodism and political
                    organization, toward more concrete job oriented, task oriented, development
                    oriented things with older volunteers possessing specialized professional
                    skills. I very much agreed with that approach. I was pretty well disillusioned
                    with what I had seen in Colombia. So, we got along just fine.</p>
                <p>While I was in Venezuela, we really did a complete remake on the Peace Corps
                    there and started up programs in totally new fields like hospital
                    administration. We started getting a lot of retirees in and more experienced
                    professionals. Another program already in existence before I got there was in
                    urban planning and municipal administration. We hardened up these programs and
                    thereby generated a new set of problems that were, in many ways, as complex as
                    the ones we left behind. But they were of a different kind. Then, the Vietnam
                    thing came to a head. The Cambodian bombing began. Kissinger became an
                    explosively controversial figure in Peace Corps volunteer land. Demonstrations
                    and political activism came to a head. I had to face, on the one hand, a
                    programmatic remake and, on the other, undertake an excruciatingly sensitive
                    mediation of a political confrontation between the embassy and the volunteers,
                    who were rebelling not only against the war but against the authority of the
                    U.S. government itself and its right to control their actions in Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the confrontation first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Those were the days of the Cambodia bombing and the othebombings. There
                    were a lot of political demonstrations in the States.</p>
                <p>Q: Berkeley had happened, but the Kent State thing happened in the late spring of
                    1970. I was in Saigon at that time. It was the incursion into Cambodia that
                    prompted the Kent State thing.</p>
                <p>DACHI: The thing was that people in the States were taking over deans' offices
                    and university presidents' offices and having very dramatic demonstrations,
                    throwing coffins on authorities' front lawns. You had these things in Washington
                    with Nixon at the Washington Monument. The volunteers wanted to do the same sort
                    of thing in Caracas. They were very bitter and very alienated and getting more
                    into drugs. You had more and more drug problems and more people were just really
                    hostile to all USG authority figures including the Peace Corps Director, who was
                    also perceived as part of the establishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I always used to tell my Peace Corps colleagues that the most culture-bound thing
                    of all is food. I discovered that the only time I could get these volunteers
                    together to talk to me was if we had them over to the house for hamburgers,
                    cheeseburgers, and fried chicken. That would bring in even the most militant
                    anti-Vietnam warrior. They would descend on the buffet table like famished
                    locusts and virtually eat us out of house and home. They got in the house and my
                    wife was there and they had to be civil to both of us. In fact, that was the
                    only thing that got some of those people thinking that maybe I had some
                    redeeming qualities as a human being after all. That made it possible for me
                    eventually to sit down and talk to some people, not ever reach a meeting of the
                    minds, but at least they were willing to talk to me because they didn't think I
                    was totally hopeless. But it was close.</p>
                <p>Then it all came to an end. The ambassador at that time was a legendary figure in
                    the old style, Rob McClintock, the guy who as Ambassador to Lebanon took his dog
                    to the beach where President Eisenhower ordered the Marines to land. He took his
                    dog everywhere. He had his poodle with him in Caracas. The Papal Nuncio would
                    call on him and he had his poodle with him in the office. His poodle attended
                    more country team meetings than any of the section heads. McClintock was
                    colorful and flamboyant, but also the epitome of the traditional, imperial
                    ambassador. When it came time for these Peace Corps volunteers to organize a
                    demonstration in the streets of Caracas and march to the embassy to throw a
                    coffin at the entrance and throw the names of Vietnam dead into that coffin,
                    that to me was a major crisis. McClintock simply said to me, “I expect you to
                    make sure this does not happen.” It would be scorched earth if it did.</p>
                <p>I had always been one of the more cooperative Peace Corps Directors when it came
                    to working with the Country Team. So, I had good personal relations with
                    McClintock. He liked me too, but he made it very clear that I couldn't allow
                    this to happen.</p>
                <p>When, finally, things got to the point where it could not be avoided, I started
                    talking to the leaders of this thing, saying, “Look, you're here for all the
                    right reasons, to do some good in this country. If you hold a demonstration on
                    the streets of Caracas, you are, in effect, involving the host country in the
                    internal political affairs of the United States. They are not going to tolerate
                    it because good relations between Venezuela and the United States are very
                    important. If you interfere in those relations, they will throw you out and
                    there will be nothing we can do for you. Therefore, you will undermine your
                    ability to prove that this way is better than the other. The place to have a
                    political statement is on United States territory inside the embassy grounds.
                    You go there and you can make the same kind of political appeal that the
                    Constitution guarantees you if you were in the United States. If you agree not
                    to do a demonstration on Venezuelan soil, which in the first place will benefit
                    you because it will allow you to stay and do the work, I will guarantee you that
                    you can freely make your political statement on U.S. soil. I will guarantee that
                    the ambassador will hear your statement.” I went out on quite a limb when I said
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>They went for it. It was mama's fried chicken and chocolate chip cookies that got
                    me a hearing. So, they said, “Okay, that's a deal. We will march down the street
                    without carrying signs or chanting slogans.” The compromise was that from the
                    Peace Corps office, which was about a mile and a half from the embassy, they
                    would march to the embassy. On the way, they would not hold their signs up, they
                    would carry them under their arm. They would not shout or chant any slogans
                    until they got inside the gate. Then, I promised them they could have an
                    appropriate, “constitutionally correct” demonstration.</p>
                <p>I went to the ambassador. I explained all of this to him. Because he had sort of
                    a fatherly affection for me, and I think there was a lot of good sense in what I
                    was saying, he eventually agreed to come down and take a petition from them. No
                    dialogue, but he would come down, listen to the statement provided it was not
                    too long or abusive, and would actually physically accept the piece of paper and
                    walk back into his office. That was far more than Rob McClintock would have ever
                    agreed to. It wasn't a heck of a lot for these volunteers, but somehow it turned
                    out to be enough. That is, in fact, what happened. It played itself out exactly
                    according to this script. So, we survived the worst of it.</p>
                <p>This strengthened my standing in both camps enough so that we were able to move
                    on and get through this whole period without further crises. It made Rob
                    McClintock into one of the advocates of my transitioning into the Foreign
                    Service, as well as the public affairs officer there at the time, Ed Schechter,
                    who became a beloved and valued friend for the rest of his life. They said,
                    “Hey, this guy should come into the Foreign Service.” So, it worked out best for
                    me, too.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a problem and, if there was, how was it transmitted to headquarters
                    about who recruits for the Peace Corps? They were sending people who were
                    bitter, militant, and messing around. I would think that this would show that
                    they really weren't getting the right people in.</p>
                <p>DACHI: This was happening all over the world. This was like a virus that took
                    over the whole body. This wasn't unique to Venezuela or to Latin America. Many
                    of these people were idealists, but lots of others were there just to avoid the
                    draft. I don't know how the latter could have been identified and kept out
                    before the fact. There were lots of places where things didn't work out as
                    peacefully and correctly as they did that day in Venezuela. So, this was an
                    issue that Peace Corps had everywhere. It was part of the Nixon administration's
                    problem with the Vietnam War. After Kent State, the Mall, and all that, this
                    stuff was small potatoes. It was part of a worldwide thing.</p>
                <p>Q: I even had some American students who happened to be in Vietnam demonstrating
                    in front of the embassy in Saigon. I know because I got involved with some of
                    this trying to keep it from turning into something.Let's talk about trying to
                    turn the Peace Corps from an ideological instrument into a more practical
                    instrument. How did that work in Venezuela?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>DACHI: In Venezuela, it worked reasonably well. Venezuela was somewhat more
                    advanced than a lot of other developing countries. It was easier to get
                    professionals to come to Venezuela than it was to get them to go to India or
                    Nigeria. We were able to get professional volunteers in reasonable numbers. In
                    the new hospital administration program, which was “my program,” I was dismayed
                    to discover a whole new set of problems. They were different from the old, but
                    they were just as big.</p>
                <p>There was a 72 year old boiler engineer who was famous for having fixed every
                    boiler that he ever ran into for 40 years at every U.S. hospital he had been to.
                    He was the Michael Jordan of boiler engineers. He came down to Venezuela as a
                    volunteer. Oh, the publicity. He was one of our models. So, he walked into the
                    first hospital and we said, “Why is this boiler not working?” Very simple, he
                    said, “You've got an outlet valve that's broken. You've got to get a new valve.
                    Voila. Your boiler is going to work.” The Venezuelans at the hospital said,
                    “Hey, buddy, we've known that for the last 18 months. The trouble is, you can't
                    get such a valve in this country and you can't import it because customs rules
                    say that you can't.” That was a revelation to all of us.</p>
                <p>These professionals and experts came down and made an instant correct diagnosis
                    of what the problem was. But they had no idea how in the context of developing
                    countries the solutions that worked in the States were simply not available.
                    That is what sinks a lot of AID programs around the world also. It all of a
                    sudden came home to the Peace Corps that we were in danger of becoming a junior
                    AID. It wasn't a question of figuring out that the outlet valve needed to be
                    replaced, but how do you get it replaced? How do you get the Ministry of Health
                    to allocate more money for replacement parts; how do you get them to expend hard
                    currency to import them; how do you get the goods through customs, and so on.
                    That was the biggest thing. The other thing (and both of these are systemic in
                    my opinion) was simply that the Ministry of Health initially says, “This is
                    wonderful. We are going to get 25 experienced professionals in hospital
                    equipment maintenance. This is a lousy hospital here. Half the equipment is
                    broken. We are going to get these Americans who will take care of everything.”
                    The volunteer walks in and, from day one, he is a mortal threat to the local
                    workers who held these jobs and had things their way for the last umpteen years.
                    The instant they discovered that this new volunteer doesn't understand that the
                    problem is not the outlet valve, but the inability to import a new valve or get
                    the budget for a new boiler, or whatever, they immobilized and marginalized this
                    person instantly. They said, “You're telling us all these things we already know
                    and you have no idea what the real problem is. You imagine that we have the
                    money to buy a new boiler, or that a part shows up at the port, and it goes
                    right through customs.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In Peace Corps training for these new kinds of volunteers, we tried to get across
                    the differences of working in a foreign culture and a different language. But
                    all the technical issues, the protectionism, a different approach to management
                    and budgeting, those things we didn't discover as obstacles until later. We also
                    discovered that these older volunteers, professionals with significant practical
                    experience prior to joining the Peace Corps, tended to get impatient, frustrated
                    and discouraged more quickly when they learned that their advice was not always
                    readily accepted or they could not produce the quick results they expected. So,
                    in that sense, the program, which was a new, practical program of the Peace
                    Corps, ran into the same magnitude of difficulties as the old, albeit for
                    different reasons.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought this would have been considerable pressure on you as the
                    Director as being sort of the point man who could maybe go to the embassy, which
                    in turn could go to the government and try to ease up the channels of getting
                    things done.</p>
                <p>DACHI: To some degree, you could do that. We did do that. The AID directors did
                    it over the years. But then, as now in the days of a global economy, when we're
                    talking about new trade and investment in all these countries and thinking that
                    the ambassador is going to go in and straighten out some of the sticking points,
                    it doesn't always work by any means. It doesn't work today. It didn't work then.
                    It wasn't a total failure, just like the community development program wasn't a
                    total failure. There were a lot of volunteers who did a lot of good things.
                    There were a lot of these technical professionals who did a lot of good things.
                    It was the institutional program management approach that was exposing
                    weaknesses. In a way, it helped put the Peace Corps probably in the correct
                    context. After all is said and done, on a one on one, human being to human being
                    basis, a lot of people can do a lot of good. People who go through life feeling
                    that they were able to make a few good things happen here and there for a fellow
                    human being and that justifies their existence, their having lived a good life,
                    they die happier than the ones who thought they were going to change the world,
                    or tried to change the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to the next tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I went from there to Brazil. There was a five year limit on being a Peace
                    Corps official with a possible extension for a sixth year, so I still had a
                    couple of years left. Joe Blatchford, who besides Venezuela, had experience in
                    Brazil, liked what I had done sufficiently well in Venezuela that he wanted me
                    to go to his other favorite country, namely Brazil, to try to do the same thing.
                    So, I went there at the beginning of 1971. I was in Brazil from January of 1971
                    to August 1972. I was part of the first Embassy team to move up from Rio and set
                    up business in the new capital, Brasilia. Steve Low had been in charge of a
                    “pre-embassy” diplomatic outpost there for the previous two years. The first
                    American ambassador, William Rountree, took up residence in Brasilia in January
                    1970. I arrived at the same time. So, we were there together in the first days
                    of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political and economic situation in Brazil
                        when yoarrived in 1971 as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It was toward the middle period of the 20 years of military rule from 1964
                    to 1984. The first military president of Brazil was a capable technocrat who
                    would put a lot of things in order. But, afterwards, there was an outbreak of
                    violence and the kidnaping of several foreign diplomats including the American
                    ambassador, Burke Elbrick. That happened about a year before I got there. The
                    regime cracked down hard on suspected terrorists, exiled many leftist
                    politicians, among them the current President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
                    committed many violations of human rights in the process. So, there was a bit of
                    a “dirty war” there, too, not quite as widespread as in Argentina, Chile or
                    Uruguay, but there was that. There was growing political tension between the
                    military regime and what was becoming the leftist liberation theology advocated
                    by a segment of the clergy of the Catholic church. The number of rural militants
                    in the drought and poverty stricken northeastern Brazil was increasing. The
                    Archbishop of Recife, Dom Helder Camara became a leading advocate for the rural
                    poor of the northeast, and as his fame grew, he became more and more of a thorn
                    in the side of the ruling generals.</p>
                <p>Much of this had, by the time I got there, been rather brutally brought under
                    control; maybe not put down, but basically brought under control. This was also
                    the period when the generals got the idea that they could get rid of all the
                    politically unreliable poor by building a highway into the Amazon rainforest and
                    resettling them out of harm's way, so to speak. The Brazilian military rule was
                    consolidating itself after having put down a guerrilla militancy leading to a
                    number of kidnappings and opening up the Amazon to get rid of political
                    opponents. National security was the main and subsequently shown to be the
                    fatally flawed rationale for opening up and developing the Amazon region. Also,
                    the rulers believed that if they didn't settle the region first, legions of poor
                    from neighboring countries would move in and do it for them.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, Brazil moved into an intensive development phase. That is when they
                    acquired this massive foreign debt that eventually led to a moratorium on
                    payments and to over fifteen years of the worst wave of massive inflation ever
                    experienced by any country over such a sustained period of time. That vicious
                    cycle really took off after I left. So, this was a relatively stable period,
                    imposed by strict military controls, between two major waves of change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the inflation? Was this a problem then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes, it was becoming a problem. It had its roots in the extravagant
                    deficit spending initiated with the building of Brasilia 10 years earlier. But
                    it was not yet the overwhelming problem that it became by the end of the
                    eighties.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the history of the Peace Corps prior to your
                        arrival?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Brazil is so vast and so varied geographically, culturally, economically,
                    and so on, that the Peace Corps never found even a modicum of thematic coherence
                    the way it did in smaller countries. You could never describe the Peace Corps in
                    Brazil as having two or three focused objectives. You had these disparate groups
                    of volunteers in various parts of the country who had nothing to do with each
                    other, living in totally different worlds, doing a variety of things. There was
                    no unity there at all. There were quite a few regional directors in different
                    areas, but they and their projects had little in common. It was hard to put your
                    finger on what the Peace Corps was doing in Brazil, even though it had patches
                    of good programs in various areas, put together on an ad hoc basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in 1971, how big was the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: We had 600-700 people. It was one of the biggest programs, just like
                    Colombia had been. The Vietnam political situation was still going on. But in
                    Brazil, the volunteers were scattered over such huge distances that they could
                    never get together to organize the way they did in Venezuela. They were not able
                    to communicate with each other. You couldn't call a countrywide meeting of
                    volunteers and expect them to show up in one place. They had to travel for two
                    or three days just to get back and forth from their village to a state capital.
                    So, that changed the political profile significantly.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought there would have been a local problem within Brazil. You
                    have a military government, an increasingly militant set of Peace Corps
                    volunteers, local liberation movements, the Catholic Church, which is moving
                    into opposition, or at least some elements of this. I would have thought that
                    you would have all sorts of problems.</p>
                <p>DACHI: No. The size of the country negated all these factors. They were indeed
                    present, but if you throw a fish into the Pacific Ocean, it's very different
                    from dumping 500 fish into a community swimming pool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see your main job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>DACHI: I must confess that when I got there, I felt a great sense of relief that
                    I was going to be dealing with technical Peace Corps problems and not Vietnam.
                    But how did I view my job? You go to Brazil, (this is true today and it's true
                    of people who go to China, India, and Russia, these huge countries.) you've got
                    to spend a year just getting oriented. The place is so overwhelmingly big that
                    if you have some kind of countrywide responsibility, trying to grasp the
                    diversity and reality of the culture, you spend a year (If you're lucky, you
                    spend only a year.) trying to learn what is going on. I have never seen anybody
                    beat that obstacle. I've seen some of the greatest ambassadors in the U.S.
                    Foreign Service come to Brazil or India with tremendous zeal and energy. Whether
                    they admitted it or not, they took a long time just to get a feeling.</p>
                <p>I was simply going along, traveling extensively, going to all these places,
                    trying to get a handle on it. But in the end, you could only deal with Brazil by
                    saying, “I'm going to look at one state and see how we can make things a little
                    bit better in that state.” Then I would go to another state and the situation
                    was different. So, I couldn't take a national approach. I became somewhat more
                    of a retailer than a wholesaler. By that time, the Peace Corps also sort of was
                    becoming disillusioned by this hospital administration and urban planning
                    approach I had experienced in Venezuela and was looking yet again for new
                    directions. All of a sudden, English teaching came back into vogue after it had
                    been virtually discarded, and underwent a brief renaissance. Brazil was not the
                    place to forge coherent new directions out of its incredible diversity. I know
                    what I did in Colombia and I know what I did in Venezuela, but I'm not sure I
                    know what I did in Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were obviously maintaining the program, I
                        suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I kept it running and improved it here and there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, leaving Brazil, were there any particular incidents
                        that comto mind that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That was a somewhat more uneventful period. It was not eventful in the way
                    we are talking now, but it was a tremendous learning experience for me in
                    traveling all over the country and understanding the cultural diversity and the
                    history of this continent- sized country. I learned a lot for the future. I
                    learned a lot about Brazil that helped me in my subsequent assignment in Brazil.
                    I learned a lot about the Foreign Service. I have served with some really great
                    ambassadors. William Rountree was another classical ambassador, very much in the
                    traditional mold. Again, we developed a very affectionate relationship. I
                    admired him. I learned a lot from watching him work. Also, Brazil was a time
                    when I was going to find out whether this great hope of my transitioning into
                    the “real” Foreign Service was, in fact, going to work or not.</p>
                <p>Q: How did that come about?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DACHI: As you know, lateral entry into the State Department has always either
                    been impossible or extremely difficult. Lateral entry into USIA was not much
                    easier. There were people in Brazil who were trying to help me transition into
                    the Foreign Service just like there were people in Venezuela who were trying to
                    help me. It was apparent that it would never work to transition into the State
                    Department, but that it might work with USIA. Various people in the Foreign
                    Service were always speaking up on my behalf in Washington, with the USIA front
                    office to see when a lateral entry opportunity might come up. In fact, I think
                    the first one came up when I finished in Venezuela and I was about to take a
                    panel exam for an FSR [Foreign Service Reserve] appointment into USIA. Then they
                    had another budget cut and put it off. That is how I ended up going to Brazil,
                    because it didn't work out at the end of my tour in Venezuela. But eventually,
                    persistence made us aware of another moment when the door opened briefly. Well,
                    I had hung around that door for so long that the time it opened, I sneaked in. I
                    took a panel exam and they took me in as an FSR. I got into USIA. They put me in
                    a job as a regional program coordinator for Central America. They didn't know
                    initially what to do with me, so they put me into a sort of makeshift job.</p>
                <p>Then, I got lucky again. I was invited by my friend, the former PAO in Venezuela,
                    Ed Schechter, to dinner at his home. He had Jock Shirley, the area director for
                    Eastern Europe there, who was a friend of his. He carefully seated me next to
                    him. Jock had grown up in Hungary. He was one of the few not native-born
                    Hungarians who actually learned to speak Hungarian perfectly. We were in the era
                    of Frank Shakespeare as director of the U.S. Information Agency. We were placing
                    a great deal of emphasis on Eastern Europe because we were into anti-communism
                    big time in those days, and the only political contacts we were able to
                    cultivate in those countries were through cultural and press officers. So, there
                    was a great emphasis in USIA on Eastern Europe. Ed Schechter seated me next to
                    Jock Shirley. We started speaking Hungarian. I was a native speaker of
                    Hungarian, so that was like a gift from heaven for me. After that dinner, we
                    became better acquainted and he “took me away” from Central America within
                    months and made me PAO in Hungary.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1973, you were going to Hungary as public affairs officer. You were there
                    from 1973 to 1977. Could you give me a little description of how we perceived
                    the government there and also the situation in Hungary?</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>DACHI: That was a rather crucial time in U.S.-Hungarian relations. It had been
                    about 14 months since Cardinal Mindszenty, who had come to the embassy in 1956
                    during the revolution and Soviet invasion and, in effect, received political
                    asylum, finally left the Embassy and departed Hungary. He spent from 1956 to
                    1972, sixteen years, resident in the embassy. Hungary in general began a process
                    of very slow but noticeable liberalization as early as 1964, only eight years
                    after the 1956 revolution. Eventually, it ended up with what became popularly
                    known as “goulash communism” and Hungary was referred to as the “happiest cell
                    in the Soviet Bloc.” A gradual normalization with most western countries began
                    as early as 1964, but relations with the United States were frozen during the
                    entire period that the Cardinal was in the embassy. The Hungarian government's
                    position was that this was not an embassy, it was a prison. There was no
                    ambassador. Relations were at the legation rather than the embassy level and the
                    Mission was headed by a Minister. So, 14 months after the Cardinal left, at the
                    time I arrived, the first steps in the normalization process with the U.S. that
                    in other East European countries had been underway for some time were just
                    getting started. There had been a settlement of claims agreement reached during
                    that 14 month period, and the incipient opening of a bit of dialogue, not much,
                    between the two governments.</p>
                <p>In December 1973 when I got there, there was a fairly new ambassador, Richard
                    Pedersen, who had previously been Counselor of the Department of State under
                    Kissinger. He was not the first ambassador. Martin Hillenbrand was the first
                    one. Al Puhan was the second. By then, the ice had been broken for diplomatic
                    discourse, but not much had happened beyond that. There were no educational and
                    cultural exchanges or much in the way of contacts with the media. These were
                    USIS domains which were vitally important at the time throughout the communist
                    world, as the best and usually the only ways to get at least a modicum of access
                    to some knowledgeable or influential contacts beyond the restricted world of a
                    few ministries. By the way, we could not call it USIS in Eastern Europe, we
                    called it the Press and Cultural Section of the embassy, which is what it will
                    probably be called again soon all over the world after USIA and the State
                    Department are consolidated. I was sent there with instructions to finally try
                    to get a real information and cultural program started, now that normalization
                    was underway. There was virtually no program there at the time. We had a small
                    library inside the Embassy with very limited access. No off-premises activities
                    were allowed.</p>
                <p>Other than the settlement of claims, not much else had happened yet. There were
                    two key issues at the time that Hungarians felt had to be gotten out of the way
                    before they were ready for serious normalization. Number one was the return of
                    the crown of St. Stephen. It was something that Hungarian fascist troops fleeing
                    after the Soviet victory at the siege of Budapest in World War II had taken with
                    them and turned over to the Americans, and we kept it at Fort Knox. During the
                    Stalinist period, prior to 1956, there could be no question about returning the
                    crown as far as we were concerned. In fact, the subject never came up. The
                    Stalinist authorities of the time had no interest in the crown.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>After 1956, there was a new regime installed by the Soviet Union. Janos Kadar
                    became the First Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party and was put in
                    office with the aid of Soviet tanks. He, in fact, stayed as the head man until
                    1986 or 1987. So, returning the crown remained out of the question for many
                    years. The Hungarian emigre community in the United States was very influential
                    and was adamant about that, but the State Department was firmly opposed to it as
                    well. On the other hand, the Hungarian regime felt that until we returned the
                    crown and thereby accepted the legitimacy of the Kadar regime, something that
                    unlike his pre-1956 predecessors Kadar was desperately anxious to get, normal
                    relations were not possible. They resented the fact that they were not regarded
                    as legitimate by the United States. To them, the key issue was the return of the
                    crown. It was sort of a sine qua non. To us, on the other hand, that was
                    something that would come as the last step of normalization, not one of the
                    first. The other key issue for them was receiving Most Favored Nation (MFN)
                    status, which had, by that time, been granted on an annual renewable basis to
                    Romania and Poland. We wanted to keep that for the later stages also, and linked
                    it with human rights and freedom of emigration issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been granted to Yugoslavia, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: In those days, we never looked at Yugoslavia from Budapest or thought
                    about it in terms of our East European policy, because it was not part of the
                    Moscow orbit.</p>
                <p>We were not ready for these two big issues. We thought of them as our trump
                    cards. In moving relations forward, they remained the principal obstacles. They
                    were preconditions for the Hungarian side. We first wanted an expansion of
                    contacts, dialogue, and access for political reporting. We wanted more relations
                    with the media. We wanted cultural exchanges and contacts. We wanted to explore
                    expanded trade relations. But that was as far as we were ready to go. So, the
                    time I was there, on the one hand, the dialogue intensified and expanded between
                    the two countries, but on the other it was fundamentally spinning its wheels
                    when it came to the two irreconcilable issues.</p>
                <p>Q: You had as Secretary of State during a good part of this time Henry Kissinger,
                    who was sort of more aware and probably more sensitive to Central European
                    problems from his background. You had the Realpolitik man, Richard Nixon, as
                    President for part of this time. Did you feel more of an engagement by the
                    powers that be in the foreign policy area, Nixon and Kissinger, than at other
                    times toward Hungary?</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>DACHI: There is no question that they wanted to engage more. But as far as
                    Hungary was concerned, the price was the crown and the crown was out of the
                    question. As it turns out, the crown was returned in 1978, not that much later,
                    after Jimmy Carter became President. But in 1974 that seemed like a long way
                    off. So, yes, Nixon and Kissinger wanted to engage, but they wanted to engage in
                    the kind of political dialogue that was going to loosen the ties between Hungary
                    and Moscow, the way, to a large degree, in Romania and, to a lesser degree, in
                    Poland it had already happened and, at the other extreme, was not happening at
                    all in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. They were hoping that Hungary, which was
                    somewhat liberal on the economic side, could be energized a little bit to
                    liberalize on the political side. In fact, they might have been disposed to do
                    that, but the crown meant everything to them in those days.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this one of these things where, every time you would sit down with a
                    Hungarian official, the crown would be the first subject that they would talk
                    about?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely, the crown and MFN. After a while, we just used shorthand. You
                    would go there and talk about anything, about opening an exhibit or whatever,
                    and they would say, “Well, of course, we're in the period where the two key
                    issues are awaiting resolution.” They did not have to spell them out. It was
                    just understood. But they referred to the two key issues each and every time,
                    without exception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Our response was that there had to be prior movement on other issues. But
                    even though Kissinger and certainly Nixon wanted to intensify their activities
                    and get more results from Eastern Europe, Hungary, in the grand scheme of
                    things, was on the back burner. Poland and Romania were much more important to
                    us for a variety of reasons. So, it's not like we were getting constant
                    reminders from Washington that we needed to accomplish more. That was not the
                    case. It was a fairly quiescent situation.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find contacts (You were born there.), particularly with various
                    elements, the plain bureaucrats, and with the intelligencia and the media
                    people?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>DACHI: This is a very interesting subject that we could talk about for quite a
                    while. I would say there were two key things. Number one, I don't want to say I
                    was the only Hungarian-speaking officer at the mission, but I was the only one
                    with total fluency. This placed me in a unique situation on both sides. On the
                    American side, I was able to be very useful. I could read the newspapers and
                    watch television and be the eyes and ears for much that was shielded from
                    non-Hungarian speakers. I was able to make a greater contribution than normally
                    a public affairs officer could. On the Hungarian side, I was able to have many,
                    many more useful and often very important contacts than I might otherwise have
                    had. Over the three and a half year period, as dialogue was improving, we found
                    that there were many people interested, willing, and often eager to say things
                    to an American diplomat in a nuanced form in their own native tongue which they
                    would not have felt comfortable saying in English. Many of these valuable
                    contacts spoke no English at all and for the first time had a chance to talk to
                    an American diplomat. As a result, I was able to make very substantial
                    contributions to the Embassy's political reporting.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I had this Hungarian background and I had some relatives
                    there, including a cousin who in my childhood years had briefly become my legal
                    guardian after my parents died. He was a music director at the Hungarian State
                    Opera, so he was a very prominent person. His wife was head of the western
                    department at the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce. Their son was in the Hungarian
                    foreign service and had recently been political counselor at their embassy in
                    Washington. That was a situation laden with ambiguities and potential peril. In
                    fact, about two years after I got there, in large part for those reasons, a
                    major full-blown effort to recruit me was made.</p>
                <p>Q: When you say an effort to recruit you, could you explain what that means?</p>
                <p>DACHI: The general who was in charge of Hungarian counterintelligence in the
                    Ministry of Interior personally attempted to recruit me in a carefully laid out
                    operation in which he made a proposal for me to commit espionage for them in
                    exchange for very substantial money payments. Many years later, after the fall
                    of the communist regime, my cousin told me that the Ministry of the Interior had
                    made an effort to get him and his family involved in this, which they refused to
                    do. In fact, the whole time I was there, I had a wonderful relationship with my
                    cousin, a very warm family relationship. At that time, he never intimated that
                    anyone had tried to involve him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this proposal made? How overt was it? How were
                        yodealing with it as an American Foreign Service officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>DACHI: It was sort of a classical textbook effort. My wife and I and two of our
                    children went to Lake Balaton in Hungary, a summer resort, for our vacation. A
                    man, who later turned out to be the general from the Ministry of Interior,
                    showed up in the same hotel. He first approached me by saying that his daughter
                    was along, too. He saw that I had a daughter. Could they get together and play,
                    practice English, and so on? Then he began to chat, asking me the kinds of
                    questions that an average educated person interested in foreign affairs would
                    ask about the United States; in other words, general interest questions. Then he
                    gradually intensified the dialogue until the end of our vacation period,
                    although even by that time he had not yet revealed anything in the way of
                    recruitment as his eventual purpose. He asked me if I was allowed to have
                    Hungarian friends in Budapest. I said, “That's why we're here.”</p>
                <p>A few days after we returned to Budapest, he called me. He invited me to dinner
                    at a hotel in a remote suburb of Budapest. As it says in the movies and the
                    textbooks, you're supposed to do that in an isolated location, which is
                    precisely what he did. I started becoming suspicious. I hadn't been too
                    suspicious before, but now I was alerted enough that I reported it to the
                    charg�, Clayton Mudd, before I went. Mudd knew that I had dozens and dozens of
                    contacts. The idea of having dinner with any of them was nothing unusual, but
                    there was something about this particular thing that bothered me. So, I
                    mentioned it to the charg� because the ambassador, Eugene McAuliffe, was out of
                    town.</p>
                <p>Once we met at the hotel and sat down to dinner, the man got right down to
                    business. He told me in a very cool and carefully crafted way that he was the
                    General in charge of counterintelligence at the Ministry of Interior, that he
                    wanted to propose a “cooperative venture” to me, to improve U.S.-Hungarian
                    relations by having us work together against certain “mutual adversaries” that I
                    could help him with. First he mentioned China. This was not long after we had
                    opened our first diplomatic post in Beijing and we were not yet allowed to have
                    bilateral contacts with Chinese diplomats in other countries. But we could talk
                    if we “accidentally bumped into each other” at third country events like
                    Independence Day receptions.</p>
                <p>The Chinese Deputy Chief of Mission, (DCM) in Budapest was an excellent Hungarian
                    speaker and he and I did in fact bump into each other from time to time at such
                    functions. Because of our mutual fluency in Hungarian we would have quite
                    lengthy conversations, although never about anything terribly substantive or
                    politically sensitive. It was the buzz of the foreign diplomatic community and
                    obviously Hungarian intelligence had gotten wind of it too. The Hungarian
                    spymaster was obviously eager to “tap into” that dialogue but I was able to
                    deflect that by insisting, truthfully as it happened, that the Chinese man never
                    ever said anything of importance to me. Then the General mentioned West Germany,
                    which was easier for me to handle because I just said that they didn't exactly
                    qualify as “mutual adversaries,” since they were members of NATO and staunch
                    allies of ours.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>At this point, this was becoming a very stressful and intense situation for me,
                    to put it mildly. I was trying to think back to what it was that I was told in
                    briefings and training as the thing to do in a situation like this. It wasn't a
                    heck of a lot to fall back on except that I did remember, in general, that they
                    said, “Don't get involved in any discussions, arguments, or debates. Just listen
                    and remember as much as you can. Say as little as possible and get out of there
                    safely and without commitments. Then come back and report it to the embassy and
                    we'll take it from there.” So, that was my strategy, although, in the event,
                    it's a little more nerve-wracking to carry out than it is when you listen to it
                    at the Foreign Service Institute in a briefing.</p>
                <p>He ended up making a complete proposal for my providing them information. He kept
                    saying, “Nothing about the United States. Just about other countries.” He then
                    offered basically financial incentives. He didn't refer to my family at all or
                    try to use any blackmail of that sort. There were no “outside women” in my life
                    that he could use. He said that they would take care of my three children's
                    college education in the U.S. from beginning to end. That was basically the
                    financial offer, plus whatever expenses he thought I was going to incur in
                    taking people to dinner, lunch, or whatever to get information for him. The
                    evening did come to an end eventually, about what seems like nine months later,
                    but still in the same evening. The next couple of days I spent in the “bubble”
                    at the embassy debriefing people with tape recorders. That was sent back to
                    Washington. The ambassador was then instructed to make a protest.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian Foreign Minister eventually came back to him and said that I was
                    hallucinating, that none of this had happened. But one of the things the
                    ambassador stressed very carefully was, “You may think it was a hallucination
                    but we know he is telling the truth. One thing should be very clear: he is not
                    leaving here. We've got here a list of all his contacts and all his activities.
                    If even one of these contacts is now going to be impeded in meeting with him, we
                    are going to consider this a major factor in harming the bilateral
                    relationship.” He made a very strong demarche. In fact, in a rather unusual
                    situation, I remained at post for the rest of my tour for a little over a year
                    and they never bothered me again. I continued to work without change with all my
                    contacts.</p>
                <p>The period I was there, I did establish a modest information program and a
                    considerable cultural and educational exchanges program. I got the Fulbright
                    Program started and even some International Visitors, none of which was possible
                    prior to that time. This was, however, under restricted circumstances. We were
                    not able to program off premises. I had literary evenings, speakers, movies, and
                    so on at my house, organized around dinner. But I left there with a substantial
                    USIS program established, which had not existed three and a half years before
                    and managed to live through, overcome, and cope with this recruitment effort
                    without it affecting the work. It was a memorable period in my life. If you
                    really want to hear the details of how the recruitment was done, that's a whole
                    hour right there. Since we're trying to keep things here in sort of a narrative
                    contextual form, I think I gave you the salient summary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other contacts? Was there what could be called
                        aintellectual class in Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Oh, absolutely, there was very definitely an intellectual class. We
                    developed very extensive dialogue with them. The thing about these writers,
                    artists, historians etc., as far as the East European communist regimes were
                    concerned, there were two issues uppermost on their minds. Number one, they
                    needed a contented, shall we say co-opted intellectual class for a lot of
                    reasons. They had to maintain an image of people who were working, productive
                    and visible, to show that, of course, the regime respected history, culture, and
                    intellectual pursuits. This was extremely important, even to the crudest and
                    most dogmatic party hacks. That was one thing.</p>
                <p>At the same time, to most communists the word intellectual was synonymous with
                    dissident. Hungarian policy toward intellectuals was a very fine line between
                    giving them maximum freedom on party terms so that they would produce
                    “acceptable work,” without allowing them to become dissidents. In Hungary, like
                    in other East European countries, they had sort of a cultural czar, a special
                    minister, one of the most trusted party officials, in charge of being the
                    watchdog of the intellectuals. He was the man who in the ultimate analysis would
                    say, “Yes” or “No” whether a book could be published and would say “Yes” or “No”
                    on trips to the West, and so on. His name was Gyorgy Aczel. Compared to the
                    Czech intellectuals, who had that Charter 76 group which became a significant
                    dissident movement in 1976, it didn't quite happen that way in Hungary. It
                    didn't happen because with a few notable exceptions, the Hungarians were given
                    just a little more leeway, just enough to keep them vested in the benefits the
                    system provided in return for them not making any trouble. They appreciated the
                    fact that the regime was not clamping down as hard as the others. They managed
                    to get by with that.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, it wasn't until after the fall of the communist regime, when I
                    started going back there for visits and looking up some of my old intellectual
                    friends, that I discovered a whole new dimension to this issue. Many of them
                    were very unhappy with the fall of the communist regime. They felt they were
                    worse off under the new system. It turns out that in this new system, they would
                    write a book, go to the publisher, and the publisher would say, “This is a nice
                    book, but I don't think it would sell enough copies. I don't think I can make
                    any money on it, so I can't publish it.” That was the opposite of what they had
                    become accustomed to under the former regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>In the old days, they could go and write anything they wanted as long as there
                    was no politically controversial material, and, in order to keep them happy, the
                    officially sanctioned publishers would print 15,000 copies of the book, put it
                    in every bookstore and pay them the royalties on the 15,000 books. If only 280,
                    or 28 for that matter were sold, so be it. It was a way to keep the writers and
                    intellectuals on the payroll, leading a privileged middle class existence. They
                    were published. They traveled to Pen Club meetings in the West and all of that.
                    They were making good money. Nobody cared if anybody bought their books or not.
                    Now the rules had changed. Once the system collapsed and they had to actually
                    produce quality stuff with market value, they were resentful and angry, because
                    the state was no longer “keeping” them, so to speak.Looking back a bit into the
                    historical roots of Hungary's independence in the middle of the 19th century
                    when it was struggling to get free of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, all the
                    heroes and leaders of that struggle were poets and writers. They were in that
                    role because the development and enrichment of the Hungarian language was seen
                    as a key tool for moving them farther away from Austrian domination and the use
                    of the German language which had been imposed on them. So, in Hungary poets have
                    had extraordinary standing for over a hundred years, because as the creators of
                    a richer and more highly developed language, they became the creators of a more
                    distinct Hungarian national identity, distancing themselves from the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire and paving the way to eventual independence.</p>
                <p>This, even to the communist regime, was something they never lost sight of. Even
                    in “Nepszabadsag,” the Hungarian communist party paper, there was a whole page
                    devoted to poetry every week. There were lots of poets and writers on the
                    full-time public payroll writing for dozens of publications. They would get
                    published everywhere. In the regime's never-ceasing struggle for legitimacy,
                    which it nevertheless failed to achieve because it was installed by the Soviets
                    supporting intellectuals, supporting literature and writers and poetry and
                    merging this with the image of the party, were1 absolutely key factors.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you able to get members of the intellectual class, particularly the poets
                    and others, off to the States? Was there much curiosity about what was going on
                    in the United States?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Those are two separate questions. A large part of the intellectual
                    community was overwhelmingly Western-oriented. In fact, Hungary, in spite of all
                    those years behind the so-called Iron Curtain, never lost its Western
                    orientation. Nowhere was that more evident than among the writers. There were
                    very few with a Solzhenitsyn type nationalist orientation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a devout Russian or a devout Slav. There was no
                        compromise with the West or anything else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>DACHI: Right. The intellectual class in Hungary, many of them spoke English and
                    read English. English language books were available to a limited extent. They
                    had a literary journal dealing exclusively with writings from the West. They
                    didn't set the United States apart from Western Europe. They were interested in
                    all of it. Quite a few of them actually had a chance to travel to the West even
                    before we in the embassy and USIS began to find a few new avenues for them to
                    go. The Iowa Writers Program, for example, had Hungarian participants before we
                    got into the picture. So, there was a certain amount of transit.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian Solzhenitsyns, to the degree that they were nationalist, were
                    really only nationalists on one issue. That was anti-Romanian and the historical
                    struggle over Transylvania, the treatment of minority Hungarians in Romania, and
                    the treatment of Romanian minorities in years past by the Hungarians.</p>
                <p>I used to have cultural evenings at my house almost every week. I showed a lot of
                    movies that had a certain amount of “freight,” like “Jesus Christ Superstar,”
                    and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,” to cite two examples that made a deeper
                    impact on my audience than any other films I can recall. They were particularly
                    intrigued with the latter, especially because it was directed by Milos Forman, a
                    fellow East European of Czech origin. The whole idea that “everybody is insane
                    except me,” the theme of that movie, had them riveted. In a symbolic but very
                    real sense they considered themselves inmates of an asylum too, where grappling
                    with the question of who were the insane ones was a central part of their
                    existence. I had a lot of U.S. authors, poets, writers, dancers, musicians who
                    came and gave readings or performances. I had a large living room that could
                    accommodate up to 100 people. We had stuff going all the time.</p>
                <p>At first, it was hard for Hungarians to get permission to come. We were always
                    under surveillance. But I did something that in retrospect turned out to be the
                    right thing to do. I never limited my guest list only to dissidents. I used to
                    say that “If we have someone to speak on U.S. contemporary fiction, then anyone
                    who is interested in U.S. contemporary fiction is welcome to come to my house
                    even if he is the First Secretary of the Communist Party.” I wasn't there to
                    undermine the regime. I was there to exchange and offer ideas. So, there were
                    pro-regime and communist people at my house along with these others at all
                    times. I never ran an underground salon. People used to flatter me by saying
                    that this was the modern day version of Gertrude Stein's salon.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>After a while, more and more people got permission to come, because some of the
                    people who had to give approval could come themselves, so they didn't have to
                    worry as much.There was nothing overtly subversive about it. I defused a little
                    bit of the paranoia by saying that “I am only here to offer things from the U.S.
                    and if you're interested, come and see them.” In fact, one reason it took me so
                    long to get suspicious of the general who tried to recruit me was my attitude
                    that I was there to tell people about the United States and, as long as they
                    were asking me legitimate questions, I was delighted to tell them anything they
                    wanted to know. I didn't care who they were. A lot of people chose not to tell
                    me who they were to protect themselves. That was fine with me. As long as you're
                    asking me things like how the U.S. Congress works or how the primary elections
                    work, I'll tell you. I don't care who you are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to travel around much in Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I could have traveled around. There is not as much need for travel in
                    Hungary as in other countries. It is a small country. There is only one
                    significant city. Everything is concentrated in Budapest. If you did travel, you
                    would find that people outside the capital were a lot more uncomfortable dealing
                    with an American diplomat than the contacts I acquired in Budapest, because they
                    were unaccustomed to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the press there? Was there any rapport with the
                        press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: There was a great deal of rapport with the press. I had lots of events for
                    the press. Those were the days when videotapes were first beginning and the very
                    first video recorders were coming into use. We used to get tapes of “Meet the
                    Press,” and even the presidential debates between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.
                    I had lots of events for journalists, and they always came in large numbers. I
                    would say that about two-thirds of these people, at least the ones that I had
                    come upon, were also Western oriented. Many, many of them were very interested
                    in serious discussions about things going on in the United States and the West
                    and our views on international relations and foreign policy and so on. Those
                    were some of the most substantive, meaty, and interesting discussions. They
                    couldn't write about it, but they were all interested in it.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Their writing in a most indirect way did somehow reflect this input, in the sense
                    that at least they had to know in their minds that our viewpoint had a great
                    deal of legitimacy, even if it was not permissible for them to say so. But I
                    would say that most of them knew every day they lived there that we had the
                    better of these arguments and that they were simply in a geographic location
                    where, because of historical circumstances, they were restricted and controlled
                    in what they could do, what they could write. There were very, very few
                    dedicated communists or true believers among them. But nobody dreamed that this
                    would come to an end one day. They had to survive and make a living, take care
                    of their children. If you were a writer or a journalist, if you wanted to
                    survive, you had to play within the rules of the system there. But that doesn't
                    mean that you ever truly believed that it was right or that it was true. So they
                    were always extremely interested in honest, substantive discussions and
                    exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about placements from the Western press, areas you
                        dealwith?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Well, there was the USIA Wireless File and, first and foremost, it was
                    very useful for internal use in the embassy. I would send selected articles to
                    certain journalists, but, of course, nothing ever was placed. There was no Voice
                    of America correspondent there. At the government level, there was next to no
                    interest shown. Nothing we sent was ever acknowledged in public although many
                    people thanked me for it in private and wanted to keep the flow of materials
                    coming. We distributed articles very extensively, and I am sure that many people
                    found them useful for background reading. I took that thing a long way.</p>
                <p>We had extensive distribution, some of it to very interesting destinations. For
                    example, the party central committee had an economic think tank that none of us
                    had ever heard about previously, whose function was to keep up with, analyze and
                    report on economic developments in the West. They were expected to write the
                    most factual, objective analyses of what was going on in the West. The only
                    people who got to read that, of course, were members of the central committee
                    and others with top clearances. The communist leaders of the country felt they
                    had to have the straight story about everything that went on in the West, and
                    they employed the best economic specialists to do that, even though nobody else
                    outside their tight party circles could know about it. That institute was one of
                    our biggest clients. They wanted everything we had in our wireless file. All of
                    those stories, briefings by Kissinger and everything else you can think of, they
                    got to the top leaders of the party establishment through us. One day, our
                    Secretary of the Treasury gave a policy speech to an IMF meeting in Manila. Our
                    contacts at the think tank were on the phone asking for a complete transcript
                    before it had even come in on the file. So, there were things we were doing that
                    were quite centrally related to getting our policy points across, but it wasn't
                    always done in what we would call conventional open channels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of the think tank, how it operated, what
                        they werinterested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>DACHI: To some extent. They were calling me and I was sending them the stuff. I
                    think that when I first got into this thing somehow (I don't remember how.), I
                    didn't know what their real purpose was. But eventually, somebody told me. The
                    way this thing worked for me was, first of all, I would invite people to my
                    house for some program. Sometimes we would have an economist speaking. Sometimes
                    a CODEL would come and I would invite a Congressman to speak. I would invite a
                    group of Hungarian contacts. Then I would get a call saying, “Do you mind if I
                    bring so and so along, who is an economist?” There were always people who came
                    along that I had never heard of before. They came, gave me their card, and said,
                    “The next time you have an interesting article in the wireless file, send it to
                    me.” Probably that's how I got hooked up with those people at the central
                    committee think tank. Lots of times that would happen.</p>
                <p>Another valuable dimension of these programs at my house was that if there was
                    some activity of a dissident nature going on we were interested in, for example,
                    when a group oCzech dissident writers signed that protest manifesto, Charter
                    1976, and we wanted to know if something similar might happen in Hungary and who
                    was going to sign and who wasn't, they knew we were interested in this. I would
                    have an event at my house. There would be maybe 12 of these people among the
                    guests. One of them would come up to me and give a few small bits of information
                    and walk away. Later, another guy would come up to me and say a few things and
                    walk away. By the end of the evening, I could construct a mosaic in which I had
                    learned all that we needed to know about this particular activity, but no one of
                    them ever told me enough so that you could attribute meaning to or piece
                    together the whole puzzle from what any single individual had said. That was one
                    way of protecting themselves against accusations of treason. They often
                    communicated with us by this method. It was a fascinating thing.</p>
                <p>Q: When you left there, it was 1977. What was your impression of the difference
                    in relations between the time you arrived and when you departed?</p>
                <p>DACHI: What impressed me particularly was the fundamental importance of having a
                    broad dialogue with people in all walks of life, in government and party and
                    other levels. What we did through this dialogue was to clear away the underbrush
                    of problems and misunderstandings that had accumulated after the war, during the
                    Stalinist era and following the 1956 revolution. Nothing much by way of concrete
                    accords was reached while I was there other than the fact that we signed a
                    cultural agreement, which is something our government doesn't attribute much
                    importance to in any case. But by substantially broadening and extending the
                    dialogue into all sectors, in both official and unofficial, we made it possible
                    to eventually accelerate the process of improving relations. Visits by CODELs
                    and administration officials at increasingly senior levels also laid a lot of
                    ground work. The flow of international visitors and exchanges was growing.
                    Memories of Cardinal Mindszenty's 16-year stay in the embassy were fading.
                    Pretty soon the idea of considering MFN or returning the crown didn't seem quite
                    so explosive anymore.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>A new ambassador, Philip Kaiser, came to Hungary in 1977, about the time I left.
                    He was a very able and wise man. His personality and skills seemed tailor-made
                    for dealing with the kind of circumstance in which he found himself. And, he had
                    a new brief from a new president, Jimmy Carter, who was looking for ways to
                    distinguish himself in foreign policy from the line taken by Richard Nixon and
                    Gerald Ford. The way Kaiser was put together, he was just the right guy for the
                    time. The crown was returned within a year after I left. It was taken there by
                    the Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance. This was something that had seemed
                    inconceivable a couple of years earlier. So, after having done four years of
                    spadework, all of a sudden, things began to happen. MFN came along sometime in
                    that period also. After that, the normalization process quickly ran its course
                    and brought U.S.-Hungarian relations to a level commensurate with the much more
                    liberal regime in Hungary as opposed to its neighbors. It would have happened
                    much earlier if it hadn't been for Cardinal Mindszenty's presence there.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of Janos Kadar? When he first came in in 1956, he was
                    certainly the evil genius, or whatever you want to call it, from the American
                    point of view. From the embassy point of view and your own personal point of
                    view, how did we evaluate Kadar by this time?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Kadar was a unique figure. Almost the whole Hungarian communist party
                    leadership spent the period between the First World War and the Second World War
                    in Moscow. Kadar was not one of those. He stayed behind in Hungary. The rest of
                    them were all one hundred percent creatures of Moscow. Matyas Rakosi, who was
                    Stalin's tool and boss of Hungary during the most brutal years of repression
                    from 1948 until he was deposed shortly before the 1956 revolution, was one of
                    those. These people were Moscow-trained and legitimately deserved the label of
                    puppets. Even though Kadar was one of them in terms of communist ideology, he
                    was different in that he had spent most of his time in Hungary.</p>
                <p>To understand the man, it is essential to realize that he regarded himself as the
                    only one among those dedicated communists who was also a Hungarian nationalist
                    while at the same time remaining ultimately loyal to Moscow. For the thirty some
                    odd years he was in power, his goal as he saw it always was to serve Hungarian
                    national interests first, albeit within the tight Moscow-imposed constraints on
                    all the countries in the East European block. Kadar was extremely cognizant of
                    and realistic about the fact that Stalin drew the line for the Iron Curtain as
                    first and foremost a cordon sanitaire against any future German invasion. The
                    next time there was going to be a war, the reasoning went, it was going to start
                    somewhere farther west than on the Soviet border. To impart the communist
                    ideology to the East European countries was secondary to that. Ideology and the
                    communist dialectic was a tool, the only tool Moscow knew how to use, to impose
                    its control from a strategic and military standpoint and keep the East European
                    satellites in the Soviet camp.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>What Stalin and his successors had to have were people they could trust
                    absolutely in charge of each of the parties so that there would never be any
                    danger of these people going off in separate ways from Moscow, above all in
                    foreign policy. Most of these people turned out to be heavy footed, stiff, the
                    worst kind of apparatchiks who truly were puppets of Moscow. Kadar was not such
                    a person. But he realized that if he didn't adhere to the Moscow line, he could
                    not survive. The bottom line on Kadar is that he got more for Hungary in terms
                    of relative liberalization, economic and cultural, than anyone else could have,
                    by never giving the Soviets anything to worry about on foreign policy or on
                    losing control of the party. They, in turn, gave him more latitude to do liberal
                    things in Hungary that may have looked dangerous from Moscow and would have been
                    unacceptable say in Prague with Dubcek. He tried to do very much the same thing,
                    but he wasn't trusted. They trusted Kadar because they knew that, in the
                    ultimate analysis, he kept Hungary in the Soviet camp. As long as that was the
                    case, he had quite a bit of leeway.</p>
                <p>That is the way he was evaluated by us. I think that Richard Nixon, Henry
                    Kissinger and National Security Advisor Helmut Sonnenfeldt were all strategic
                    thinkers who appreciated that. I think they wanted to take it a step further and
                    say, “In that case, why can't we have a more substantive dialogue about
                    detente.” Kadar's answer was never stated openly, but was assumed to be that,
                    without MFN and the crown as a prize for his national objectives, it was not
                    worth it to him to take the risk. Even the most harmless substantive dialogue,
                    if he had nothing to show in return, would appear to be far too worrisome to
                    Moscow. What I imagine he might have said was, “I'd love to sit down and talk
                    with you, but we can't make any progress beyond a certain line. Anyway, if we
                    make believe we are two pals just chatting over a cigar and some cognac, those
                    guys in Moscow are going to pull my chain and it isn't worth it to me. Doing my
                    best for Hungarians depends on the goodwill of Moscow and, most of all, on their
                    trust and confidence in me.”</p>
                <p>I think that was appreciated on the whole. On the other hand, Kadar realized, for
                    example, that he could never come to Washington on an official visit because he
                    would always be branded as the guy who rode the Soviet tanks into Budapest. So,
                    his presence and persona, in spite of whatever nuanced interpretation a
                    particular U.S. senior official might give it, imposed a limit to what could be
                    done with him. From the standpoint of the Hungarian-American community here and
                    all the political appearances, Kadar could never be sanitized enough so that he
                    could be brought over here and have the kind of contact that we had with Poland
                    and Romania.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the Hungarians you were able to engage in private talk have the same
                    impression of Kadar, that he was probably the best you could get under the
                    situation?</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>DACHI: Oh, absolutely, and they worded it exactly the way you did. They all
                    realized that this whole communist thing was a sham, but they knew that Kadar
                    was good for them because he could get them more than anybody else under
                    circumstances which were totally beyond their control. The intellectuals had
                    their czar, Gyorgy Aczel, who was also personally selected by Kadar and they
                    knew he was the best they could hope for. If you don't have Kadar, you don't
                    have Aczel, and so on down the line. So, yes, everybody appreciated it. In the
                    end, as Kadar started getting old, times were changing and the pace of east-west
                    relations picked up. He was actually put aside a year or two before the Iron
                    Curtain came down. He “retired.” The communists who took his place, much more
                    conscious of the realities of a changing world, were the ones who actually
                    brought down the Iron Curtain by being the first ones to allow the East German
                    tourists to leave via Hungary. That, Kadar could have never donThat was when the
                    whole system from Moscow to East Berlin began to unravel.</p>
                <p>Q: What role did you find about how the Hungarians looked at the Soviets and also
                    the role the Soviets played there? How did we evaluate this during this
                    time?</p>
                <p>DACHI: From the Hungarian standpoint, it was very simple. They had an expression
                    they used every day. It said, “This is what there is. This is what we must
                    love.” The ultimate of realism. A small anecdote here: When Daniel Boorstin, the
                    Librarian of Congress, came on a visit, they escorted him around to the usual
                    kind of meetings. He liked to ask provocative questions. People like him could
                    get away with it. I was always surprised at how openly some people answered.
                    When he visited the head of the National Archives, Boorstin said, “Look, two
                    things. First of all, when you were under Turkish occupation for 150 years in
                    the 15th and 16th centuries, the Turks primarily were trying to establish
                    economic hegemony. They ran an economic type of imperialism. Then you were under
                    the Austro-Hungarian Empire for about the same amount of time. The Austrians
                    basically were interested in imposing cultural hegemony and imperialism. Into
                    which category would you fit the Soviet Union?” The guy, without batting an
                    eyelash, said, “Both, but remember one thing. The Turks were here 150 years. The
                    Austrians were here 150 years. These guys have been here for 40 years and
                    they're not going to make 150.” The Hungarians have been through a lot over the
                    centuries and are pretty cool customers. The Poles get much more emotional. They
                    hate the Russians viscerally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, they've been run over. The Russians have
                        absorbethem. It's not the same thing with Hungary.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>DACHI: That visceral hate is not there, they looked at it in a more dispassionate
                    way. One of their favorite stories, reflecting the characteristic Hungarian
                    sense of humor is that some thousand years ago when they migrated from central
                    Russia, they fell into the hands of the wrong real estate agents and settled in
                    the worst location they could have gotten. Had they gone a little farther and
                    settled somewhere around where Belgium is today, they wouldn't have had these
                    problems. But they were stuck in the crossroads between Mongols, Turks,
                    Austrians, Germans, and Russians. They have always been under someone's boot.
                    They realized that as a small country, they were sort of condemned to be
                    spectators and all too often victims rather than participants in world affairs.
                    The end of the 1990s, this is a huge period for Hungary because, for the first
                    time, they are masters in their own house. This is extremely meaningful to them
                    for that reason. Historically, it is the first time they are able to control
                    their own destiny and are no longer condemned to be just spectators.</p>
                <p>To get back to how did the Soviets look at Hungary, their bottom line was always
                    the same. They didn't want any trouble, any deviation. And with Kadar, they were
                    very comfortable. There were always stories circulating in the west and in our
                    diplomatic cable traffic like “Kadar is going on a visit to the Soviet Union. Is
                    he in trouble? Is he going to be replaced?” What made some people on our side
                    think that we knew he was doing things that no one else in Eastern Europe could
                    get away with. We were always worried that he was going to lose his job. But he
                    never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the map, one can see that, at the time, Hungary
                        wanot what we would essentially call the Soviet front line states.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That's right. It was not.</p>
                <p>Q: Hungary has borders with Yugoslavia and Austria, both of whom were basically
                    neutralized. Czechoslovakia was poking right into Germany. Even though there was
                    East Germany, Poland was the main supply route if anything happened. Hungary was
                    sort of a backwater.</p>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely. It was not a front line state. That is exactly the proper
                    characterization. Nevertheless, the Soviets maintained troops stationed in
                    Hungary the whole time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a Soviet cultural program and how did it
                        take?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>DACHI: There sure was a Soviet cultural program. But I was a lot happier as the
                    American cultural attach� than I would have been as the Soviet cultural attache.
                    They would truck in the workers and the children from factories and schools to
                    their cultural center. They herded people in there by the hundreds all the time,
                    while we were scratching for every person who would dare come into our embassy
                    library. But all that heavy-handed Soviet propaganda just washed off the
                    Hungarians' backs. It never took. Intellectually, it probably took less than a
                    blink of an eye for the Hungarians to adapt to the collapse of the communist
                    system. Look how quickly they switched to and consolidated a functioning
                    democracy. They, the Czechs and the Poles set the ultimate laser speed record
                    for going from a communist to a democratic regime. In their hearts and minds
                    they were a western-oriented countries all the time. They rolled over, played
                    possum, whatever it took to get by. Historically, they have unparalleled
                    experience as survivors.</p>
                <p>People often said to me, “A 70 year old man today, no matter who he is, whether
                    he is a Christian or a Jew, a leftist or a rightist, wealthy or poor, worker or
                    intellectual, circumcised or not, at one time or another during his life, was in
                    danger of being killed whether it be in a world war, the inter-war period, the
                    Nazi occupation, the Soviets, whatever. It doesn't matter who you were. The
                    reasons may have varied and the targets may be different but sooner or later, if
                    you had views and were known for something, it was your turn to get killed.” My
                    contacts would sometimes say, “Well, I don't think I can come to this event at
                    your house.” I would say, “Why? They seem to be comfortable with you going to
                    these events. You seem to be fine.” He would say, “Sure, but they write all this
                    stuff down. You never know, ten years from now, it may be different and they are
                    going to call me and say, You went to that speech by an American journalist.
                    What were you doing there? This stuff could come back to bite me.” So, in
                    essence, the overwhelming majority of Hungarians were people who would be
                    extremely careful not to express a view on anything, unless they trusted you
                    absolutely. The way to survive was to never reveal anything of yourself to the
                    outside world. It's the survivor syndrome.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the role during this 1973 to 1977 time of the Hungarian-American
                    community? We had received a fairly substantial influx after 1956. There had
                    always been a Hungarian-American community particularly in the industrial area.
                    Obviously, these hyphenated communities always have a clout in American
                    politics. How did it work in the United States in this period?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Their primary interest was to make sure the crown was not returned
                    prematurely. They were very much like the Cuban-Americans are today. But they
                    weren't as obnoxious as the Cubans are. They pretty well limited themselves to
                    the crown. I don't think that when Cyrus Vance finally went back with the crown
                    he had overcome all opposition. There was probably plenty of opposition still
                    left in the community, but that sort of took the steam out of it. After that,
                    they did not really play too much of a political role.</p>

                <p>DACHI: Then I went to Panama.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I was there for about 14 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about going there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I certainly wasn't thrilled. It was not that I had my heart set on going
                    to some other particular place, nor did I want to stay in Hungary any longer. I
                    wanted to move on. But it was such a huge change in the agenda, the substance of
                    what was involved, the culture, the people, the way things were done. So, I
                    would have been happier to go to a lot of places rather than Panama. As it
                    turned out, it was not too bad. There were some interesting and significant
                    events to get involved in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at a focal point of one of the keystones of the

                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That's right. That was the time the Panama Canal treaties were signed.
                    Whatever my experiences in Panama may have been, it laid the groundwork for
                    eventually, 10 years later when my career came crashing down in flames over
                    Panama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the dates that you were in Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I arrived there in August 1977 and I stayed until Octobe1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>DACHI: The same week that I arrived was when the Panama Canal Treaties were
                    formally signed after all those years of negotiation and battle. They had a big
                    signing ceremony in Washington with all the Latin American chiefs of state. That
                    was the situation. That was, in essence, the curtain raiser for the next nine or
                    10 months' campaign for the ratification of the treaties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I was counselor for public affairs and head of USIS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador? DACHI: William Jorden.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: This was a very crucial time. I would have thought that one of the things you
                    all would be doing would be trying to make sure that there was no bad news
                    coming out of Panama.</p>
                <p>DACHI: That's true. It was impossible to control General Torrijos, so nobody
                    could “manage” him. But there wasn't that much bad news coming out of Panama. In
                    fact, I think this nine month period was of great historical interest because,
                    to my knowledge, it was the first time in our history that more than half the
                    members of the United States Senate, which is constitutionally mandated to
                    ratify treaties, had actually traveled to a foreign country to look over the
                    situation before voting. One of our biggest tasks was to organize their program
                    so that the senators would come away with a positive view of the treaties and a
                    decision to vote for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the line that the embassy and you specifically
                        wertaking when these senators came by? What were you showing them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>DACHI: We have to set the stage and the big picture. There were five elements
                    with important interests in Panama. There were very distinct groups of players
                    in this picture that the visitors were looking at. We at the embassy were
                    presenting the rationale for why ratification was in the U.S. interest and, in
                    essence, acting as lobbyists for President Carter. Another major interest group
                    was the personnel of the Panama Canal Company and the American residents of the
                    Canal Zone. Even they were divided between the administrators and employees of
                    the Canal Company and the “Zonians” who were American citizens employed by the
                    Zone administration. There was the Zone police, the Zone courts and others like
                    the teachers at the American schools who had an enormous stake in maintaining
                    the status quo. They were highly vocal in their opposition and held many
                    agitated rallies and marches that were always widely covered by the U.S. media.
                    The Panama Canal Company itself was, at best, neutral in this matter. Deep down
                    in their hearts, they were hoping the treaty would not be ratified. They were in
                    a delicate position, however. They couldn't take that line with visitors; they
                    were formally obliged to support administration policy, but they came very
                    close.</p>
                <p>Then there was the large U.S. military establishment, stationed at more than a
                    dozen bases, and the U.S. Forces Southern Command responsible not only for Canal
                    security but covering all of Central and South America. The controversial U.S.
                    Army School of the Americas was there, as was the U.S. Army anti-guerrilla
                    jungle warfare training center. I doubt that very many of them favored the
                    treaty, but none of them ever uttered a peep. In public, there was never any
                    question of their loyalty to the Commander-in-Chief. Then, of course, there was
                    the Panamanian government. And there was the Panamanian non-governmental sector,
                    the businessmen, the Church, and so on, whose interests did not always coincide
                    with those of the government.</p>
                <p>On the U.S. side, there was tremendous division of opinion among those who wanted
                    to ratify and the conservatives who were opposed to it. Very prominent among the
                    latter was Ronald Reagan, who at the time was still a private citizen, but who
                    was playing a very prominent role in opposing the ratification. John Wayne was
                    another very actively engaged high-profile opponent.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I think altogether 54 or 55 senators visited Panama before the vote. They
                    represented all the different factions. There were some people who were
                    unalterably opposed when they got there and almost without exception left
                    unalterably opposed. There were some who were in favor when they came and were
                    in favor when they left. And then there was a middle segment of the undecided,
                    perhaps less than a third of the total. There were a lot of congressmen, by the
                    way, who also came who didn't have to vote on ratification but nevertheless got
                    their oar in the water and gave press conferences. A total Panama schedule had
                    to be put together for each visit and provide time for all the interested
                    parties to get their licks in. Each side was trying to reshape their schedule to
                    their own needs. The senators who were opposed to the treaty always landed at a
                    military base in the Canal Zone and had the Panama Canal Company set up their
                    schedule and we at the embassy were lucky if we got to participate in it. That
                    was very definitely slanted in an anti-treaty way. We set up the schedule for
                    the others. The Panama Canal Company had a yacht. They took the people out for
                    cruises on the canal. That took two or three hours and that was the time when
                    they did their lobbying. We also got to be pretty good at it. The ambassador
                    played a very key role in all of this. He was very much an ideal person to be
                    doing this kind of thing. He was an expert on every aspect of the treaties and
                    was very influential. He was involved in the treaty negotiations for years
                    before they were signed, knew all the key players and knew where all the
                    skeletons were buried. He wasn't an institutional sort of person. But he was
                    great for one on one personal massaging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Bill Jorden started out as a journalist and later became a respected Japan
                    expert. He was a personal friend of Lyndon Johnson. Johnson brought him into the
                    Vietnam negotiations in Paris, for one of the early rounds when Ellsworth Bunker
                    was still heading the team. This was one of the rounds that didn't lead to any
                    results. This was pre-Kissinger. Then he became associated with the Panama Canal
                    issue working for Lyndon Johnson at the National Security Council. I think he
                    was Latin American Director there. Then he became ambassador to Panama and
                    Ellsworth Bunker became the chief negotiator of the treaties. So, Jorden had
                    already played a long and extensive role in lobbying earlier with Jimmy Carter's
                    predecessors on the need for a Panama Canal treaty. Then he went down there as
                    ambassador and was very much a part of this mix with Sol Linowitz and Ellsworth
                    Bunker, who by then were the chief treaty negotiators. He worked on the treaty
                    along with those two and Linowitz's principal assistant, Ambler Moss, who later
                    succeeded Jorden as ambassador. Jorden remained in Panama through the
                    ratification phase. Then he retired and went to Austin to the University of
                    Texas and wrote a book about the history of the treaties. Very complete and
                    comprehensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Panama, how the country was
                        running?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>DACHI: Panama has never really been a country, to put it a little bit unkindly.
                    It was always a financial trough surrounded by a bunch of operators and
                    entrepreneurs feeding off of it in various ways. As in other Latin American
                    countries, there was a small, wealthy oligarchy that controlled the economy.
                    Then there was a majority of mestizo type people, most of them very poor. There
                    was a constant alternation in power between the national guard, the only
                    military force in Panama, and various civilian governments who would get elected
                    and then get overthrown, elected again, overthrown again. So, certainly, there
                    was no institutionalized democracy nor really a functioning government.</p>
                <p>I had come there from Hungary and the contrast to me was startling. For example,
                    the Foreign Ministry in Panama was nothing. It hardly functioned at all. It had
                    one or two people working on U.S. relations, but they had no role to speak of in
                    these Panama Canal issues that we were working on. A lot of other ministries
                    were one or two people and a bunch of bureaucrats. The thing was run single
                    handedly by General Torrijos, the dictator and commander of the Panamanian
                    national guard. He didn't even really have an office. He used to go to the beach
                    where he had a cottage and laid in a hammock, a glass of whiskey in his hand and
                    an assortment of women to cater to his every whim. That is where he would
                    receive not only the ambassador, but the senators and the congressmen.
                    Occasionally he would see them at his home in Panama. But, you usually would
                    have to go to the beach to see him. My idea of some kind of institutional
                    government didn't exist and there certainly was no political structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Panama Canal Company, what were the
                        relationbetween it and the embassy and what was your impression of this
                        entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: As an entity, the Panama Canal Company was an extremely competent and
                    efficient operation without a doubt. It was run by top professionals. The head
                    of the Canal Company and the Governor of the Canal Zone were one and the same
                    person. They had the most experienced pilots and professionals in charge of the
                    operation of the canal. This was all a legacy of the way the thing was built to
                    start with. It was an admirably efficient and modern operation in every respect.
                    The basic premise of the people who had invested their lives into running that
                    company was that we, the United States, could not afford to give that up and
                    that the Panamanians basically would never be competent to run the zone much
                    less the canal. Therefore, most of them felt deeply and often vehemently that to
                    proceed with the treaty was totally contrary to U.S. interests.</p>
                <p>Q: In a way, the world had gone through one of these before, the Suez Canal back
                    in 1955/1956, where the conventional wisdom was that the Egyptians would never
                    be able to run the canal. Therefore, it has to be in the hands of the British.
                    Was the example of the Suez Canal something that came into the conversation and
                    into the calculations?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>DACHI: No, it never did. Neither the Panamanians nor the Canal company people
                    were especially known for their global outlook. This was almost completely a
                    dialogue of the deaf. To make a lame pun, it was like two ships passing in the
                    night. There was no basis for conversation. When I got there, the treaty had
                    already been signed. Perhaps before the treaty was signed, while it was still
                    being negotiated, there may have been if not conversations, bitter debates about
                    what we should do. But once the treaty was signed, the die was cast and there
                    was no more point as far as the canal people were concerned. The only hope they
                    had was that some sort of passive resistance or subtle non-cooperation would
                    somehow prevail and the treaties would not be ratified. That is where they
                    placed their hopes. There were a lot of people in the Panama Canal police force
                    who were saying, “Once Panama takes over, not only are we out of a job, but who
                    is going to keep the Zone safe, who is going to keep these Panamanians in line?
                    The people who work with the canal are going to be retained and work here, but
                    there will be no protection for their homes. We'll have no legal protection. We
                    will come under Panamanian laws. We will lose our commissary and so on. Our
                    entire way of life, free housing, etc., will all come to an end.” In their minds
                    their very existence was seriously threatened. Everybody was dug in concrete on
                    this issue.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were talking to the senators, were you using as sort of a not very
                    subtle weapon saying, “Look, these are a bunch of people who are hard working,
                    but at the same time, their living pretty high up?” I'm talking about the
                    Americans who had free housing and all that. So, their judgment is not one to
                    prevail.</p>
                <p>DACHI: I would characterize it as sort of an unspoken rule that nobody at the
                    embassy, including the ambassador, would ever say anything, certainly speak no
                    evil of anyone in the zone and no one in the zone would speak evil of the
                    ambassador. There was never anyone there in a visiting delegation who would hear
                    such comments from one side about the other. Each side was just trying to avoid
                    antagonizing even one senator. It was really a rigid, tense, uncomfortable
                    situation. Superficially, everyone was polite. But people were dug in on
                    opposite sides of the issue. There wasn't what you would consider reasoned
                    dialogue for one instant that I ever recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the senators? Did you find, by and large,
                        thewere asking the right questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>DACHI: Some of them were. A lot of the conservatives like Jesse Helms and others
                    came down, but their minds were already made up. There were some people on the
                    other side, those in favor of ratification, whose minds were made up as well.
                    But there were key people who kept an open mind. That included some very senior
                    and major players in the senate like Howard Baker, Robert Byrd, Paul Sarbanes
                    and Wendell Ford. We carefully and deliberately concentrated on those who were
                    uncommitted and wasted little time on the hard line opponents who were obviously
                    never going to come around. The key to the visits wasn't so much what the
                    embassy or the Panama Canal people said, the senators knew those positions, but
                    what their take on General Torrijos would be and what he did and told them. In
                    the end, what it boiled down to in the minds of most senators was “Are we going
                    to give the canal to this man, who is a dictator, this guy who may not be
                    threatening us directly, but is making friendly noises with Fidel Castro and
                    Qadhafi, and who may be involved in drug running and corruption. His brother,
                    Moises, was widely believed to be involved with the narcotics trade.</p>
                <p>Ronald Reagan, still a private citizen but with plans to run for President,
                    played a big role in the anti-treaty campaign. He was brought into it in an
                    interesting way. A man in Panama by the name of Arnulfo Arias had been elected
                    President four different times. Each time he was overthrown by a military coup.
                    The last time, it was by Torrijos in 1968. Arias was a popular, demagogic
                    populist who was sort of right-wing. After the 1968 coup he went into political
                    exile in Miami and took his entire coterie of political aides with him. They
                    turned into very skillful lobbyists for their cause. They got to people like
                    Ronald Reagan and others saying, “Look, yes, there should be a Panama Canal
                    treaty. We should get our canal and our canal zone back. It is the right thing
                    to do. But don't give it to this military dictator who has overthrown a
                    legitimately elected democratic government. Insist first that there be a return
                    to democracy, have elections. Then give the canal to me. Don't give it to
                    Torrijos.” Arias was sure he would get reelected easily. This is what carried
                    the day with Ronald Reagan and other conservatives. They were dead set against
                    “giving away the Canal” to Torrijos whom Ronald Reagan called “this tin horned
                    dictator.” They wanted Panama to return to democracy first and give it to
                    Arnulfo Arias.</p>
                <p>Anti-treaty senators always reminded Americans that Torrijos was a dangerous, out
                    of control dictator who was posturing at the United Nations, denouncing the
                    United States and boasting of being an ally of Qadhafi and Castro. In private,
                    Torrijos would always claim that he did these things as a political ploy to
                    pressure the United States into giving him the canal, without fully appreciating
                    that this was like feeding raw meat to the treaty opponents. Many of the key
                    conversations with senators while he was swinging inebriated in his hammock at
                    the beach, consisted of vigorous give-and-take on these points. Some of the
                    greatest anecdotes about that whole period originated there. On the whole, he
                    managed to charm most of them, and win over quite a few. He was a crude, vulgar
                    man, but he had great political instincts and he sure did know how to handle
                    American senators, who were always impressed with his earthy style and shrewd
                    debating skills, whether they agreed with him on the substance or not. Even
                    Jesse Helms was impressed, although quite obviously he was not about to be won
                    over.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I would say the balance sheet of these congressional visits was that of all the
                    people who came, everyone who was opposed when they arrived left the same way.
                    We didn't get a single pro-ratification vote from anyone who arrived there
                    opposed. On the other hand, not a single senator who came there uncommitted or
                    in favor ended up voting against the treaty. I think we were successful. The
                    treaty was ratified by the requisite two-thirds majority, without a single vote
                    to spare.</p>
                <p>Q: Here was Torrijos as the man. As it turned out later, he died in a helicopter
                    or airplane crash. Within the embassy, those who were having to look beyond the
                    ratification, was there concern after Torrijos? Was there concern among
                    yourselves about Torrijos if he took over the canal?</p>
                <p>DACHI: I think it was always clear that after the treaties were ratified, nothing
                    much would change right away as far as the canal operations. First of all, there
                    was a long transition. This was back in 1978. There was a period of about 11
                    years where the majority of the board would be American and the minority
                    Panamanian, then in 1989 that ratio would be reversed. The military bases were
                    not going to be handed over until the year 2000. Back then I don't think there
                    was anybody around down there who thought that the year 2000 would ever come
                    around. So there was to be a long transition period. We're talking about a 20
                    year period in which the Torrijos types would not be able to exercise full
                    control and our military presence would continue. Torrijos always made it clear
                    that he wasn't interested in a forcible political takeover. After all, Panama
                    desperately needed the revenue from that canal. Any Panamanian would know,
                    including Torrijos, that it had to be a professionally run operation or it would
                    fall apart. And they would need U.S. help with that for many years. So there was
                    no problem with that. His political stance was, “You want democracy? All right.
                    You give me the treaty and I'll give you democracy afterwards.” And, in a
                    limited way, he kept his word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking at the figures that the Panama Canal was
                        ceasinto be as important as it used to be because of changes in
                        transport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: There are a number of factors which have been making the Panama Canal
                    somewhat less important over time. You could argue that. But any way you cut it,
                    thCanal continues to be of extraordinary importance. Even today in 1997, if you
                    look at the number of ships and the tonnage that goes through there, that place
                    is being utilized at full capacity. They just widened the Gaillard Cut so it can
                    handle two-way traffic 24 hours a day. Even though there is an increasing number
                    of ships that are too wide to go through the canal, the number of ships that can
                    go through is also increasing. You may need other ways to transport goods across
                    the isthmus, including a container line on land. But the canal is always going
                    to be needed. It has been expanded, upgraded and modernized, because the need
                    for it remains.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Q: What about the American press? They would play an important role in molding
                    American public opinion and would help sway undecided senators. Did you find you
                    had much American press coverage?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Oh, yes, there was quite a large presence. We're talking about a nine
                    month period in which there was almost a permanent presence, including
                    television. They were usually looking for the spectacular, showy things. When
                    anti-treaty senators came, Torrijos would always pull some kind of a stunt. He
                    would organize demonstrations in front of the embassy for their benefit, and the
                    media loved to cover those. When they came into Panama City, these senators
                    would always be circumspect and never attacked or insulted Torrijos, but when
                    they returned to the canal zone and held a press conference, they would call him
                    all kinds of names. They were hoping to provoke some intemperate response from
                    Torrijos. So, the senators were pretty good copy.</p>
                <p>The question always was, what is going to happen if the Senate denies
                    ratification? Is that going to cause violence, the breakout of some kind of
                    revolution, or what? Torrijos always said that, no, there wouldn't be any
                    violence. But a lot of the senators used the usual arguments and said, “We've
                    got a lot of U.S. citizens living there and we're obligated to protect the lives
                    of U.S. citizens.” Of course, that is the code word for military intervention.
                    Everybody knew that. There was always talk about whether Torrijos will be able
                    to guarantee the safety of Americans after there is no more Panama Canal Zone
                    and no more zone police, or conversely if the treaties were rejected in the
                    senate. That was an explosive issue. As it turned out, one of the last
                    amendments to the treaties and the one hardest for Torrijos to swallow was the
                    clause retaining for the U.S. the right to intervene in Canal operations if our
                    security interests were threatened even after the year 2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much contact between the embassy and yourself
                        and th“Zonians,” as they were called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Very little contact. I myself as public affairs officer had regular
                    contact with the public affairs officers of the Panama Canal Company and the
                    U.S. Forces Southern Command, which was very important and necessary. We were
                    working together all the time, for different bosses and different purposes, but
                    not at cross purposes. There was a certain courtesy in informing each other of
                    what we were doing. But beyond that, there was very little dialogue between
                    embassy people and Zonians and hardly any socializing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about with the Panamanians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>DACHI: The Panamanian “friendlies,” such as they were, were mostly in the
                    business community and among the well-to-do. A lot of them went to school in the
                    United States and were overwhelmingly pro-American. But they were outnumbered,
                    at least in terms of decibel power in the streets by a huge leftist element, the
                    university students, the unions, the peasants, Torrijos' popular base. There was
                    tremendous hostility at the universities. That was where the demonstrators came
                    from. The press was also very anti-American, very hostile. I can't think of more
                    than a tiny handful of journalists who were even remotely objective. The
                    inflammatory anti-American language which was used for years as they were
                    fighting for the treaties was carrying over into the ratification process. That
                    was one of the things that Torrijos had to deal with. He had to reign in and
                    tame these so-called revolutionaries, the leftist extremists and the
                    provocateurs. The same language they had to use to confront the U.S. and try to
                    get the administration to give in to them on the treaty obviously wasn't going
                    to work with the Senate and the ratification process.</p>
                <p>With the business community, the professionals and the civilian leadership, we
                    had good relations. The thing that united all Panamanians, everyone agreed, was
                    that the treaty should be signed, approved, and ratified. There may have been
                    some who felt that democracy should be allowed to return first, but at that
                    point, that argument held a low priority in Panamanians' minds. It was only in
                    certain circles in the U.S. where people felt that we should hold back on
                    ratification until elections were held. Arias was certainly no role model for a
                    democratic leader. In the end, some time after the treaty was ratified,
                    elections were held and Arias came back. But he was getting very old by then.
                    Then General Noriega got in the picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at this time about narcotics in
                        Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes, absolutely. Torrijos' brother had been widely considered to be
                    involved in narcotics trafficking. Colonel Noriega, who at the time was head of
                    security and intelligence for Torrijos, was also strongly suspected of being
                    involved in narcotics. That plus all the other things he was subsequently
                    accused of, playing both sides, playing footsie with the Cubans while playing
                    footsie with us. That was all going on then. There was also widespread
                    corruption in the Colon free zone on the Caribbean coast with involvement of
                    National Guard officers up to their eyeballs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do? We couldn't sit on it. Did you explain
                        thiproblem away?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>DACHI: It was not convenient for us to focus on this at that point in time. But
                    everybody on the U.S. side who was involved in this thing knew what was going
                    on. Jimmy Carter wanted his treaty, and it was now or never. Everybody figured
                    we'll deal with these other problems later. The Cuban intelligence agencies were
                    using Panama as their number one center of operations for all of South America.
                    It was a safehaven for guerrillas being trained in Cuba transiting to and from
                    South American countries. Panama provided safehouses, false documents, all kinds
                    of other support. All this stuff was known. The question was, what can we do
                    about it? You had a treaty and it had to be ratified. It just couldn't be put
                    off any longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about after the treaty was ratified? You had been
                        therabout nine months. Did that change things at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It calmed things down, yes. Win or lose, the game was over. Everyone went
                    back to the locker room, showered, dressed and went home. It calmed things down
                    considerably. The next thing that happened was that Jimmy Carter came down for a
                    formal ceremony to exchange the instruments of ratification. That created a
                    great public event, of course. In Panama City, he was received very well.
                    Torrijos organized a huge public gathering where he and Carter spoke to a huge
                    crowd. Carter was welcomed there as a hero. Then, much to his credit, he went
                    into the Zone. He visited the locks and observed canal operations. He had a
                    meeting with Zonians at a stadium to answer questions. They were polite with
                    him. It was tense, but correct. There were no incidents. Shortly thereafter,
                    they switched their efforts to lobbying to make sure that, as they lost their
                    jobs, their benefits would be paid, they wouldn't lose housing, they could
                    retain their commissary for another couple of years, the schools passed over to
                    the Defense Department and kept open. There was no bitter aftertaste that
                    expressed itself.</p>
                <p>After Jimmy Carter left, Bill Jorden retired and Ambler Moss became the
                    ambassador. I had one last job there, introducing him to Panama. I set up a
                    slightly unorthodox schedule for him in the sense that, parallel with making all
                    the customary calls of a new ambassador, I took him all through the canal zone
                    and had him spend quite a bit of time there. He visited schools and canal
                    installations, met with workers, teachers, the police, the military. It was like
                    a political campaign for Congress. He made a lot of speeches and stressed that
                    all of us as Americans now have to respect and cooperate with what the
                    administration has signed and Congress has ratified. Moss then concentrated on
                    this and did an excellent job of getting the implementation process underway. As
                    for myself, I was transferred.</p>

                <p>DACHI: I went to Washington and spent the next six years there.</p>

                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1978-1984.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. First I was deputy area director and two years later director for
                    Latin America and the Caribbean for USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1978-1984. You were there during a tumultuous time after a
                        while. I'm talking about when the Reagan administration came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk prior to the Reagan administration coming in, which would be
                    1978-1981. What was the atmosphere concerning USIA? What were your concerns in
                    Latin America and the Caribbean?</p>
                <p>DACHI: That was the early period after the Sandinistas had overthrown Anastasio
                    Somoza and come to power in Nicaragua. It was a time in which everyone was
                    waiting to see whether the Sandinistas were going to turn into Castro-like
                    communists or whether we were going to be able to find a modus vivendi with
                    them. That was one of the big questions. Another issue was that Jimmy Carter,
                    having successfully navigated the Panamanian treaty waters, now thought that
                    maybe the time had come to start to make some progress on relations with
                    Cuba.</p>
                <p>The whole time I was there, there was this bizarre inversion of priorities in
                    U.S. interests. While the huge countries in Latin America like Brazil,
                    Argentina, Mexico were receiving virtually no attention from us, all our
                    priorities, concerns, resources and efforts were going to the countries of
                    Central America and Cuba. That is what I remember spending most of my time on.
                    It was a strange thing. In the USIA Area Offices you had a director and a deputy
                    director. Before, the director always dealt with the big issues and the big
                    countries and the deputy did the small ones. The whole time I was there, it was
                    the opposite. I was crashing on crises in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Cuba, Jamaica,
                    Grenada, and so on. My deputy worried about “insignificant things” like Brazil
                    and Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stick to the Carter years first. What about Mexico?
                        Werthere any issues then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>DACHI: There were plenty, even though we rarely focused on them. And they were
                    vastly different from what they are today. There was a dividing line that
                    occurred in the Reagan period. Prior to that, the “old Mexico” was basically one
                    that followed a policy of anti-Americanism and a distinctly Third World foreign
                    policy. They were unusually friendly with Cuba, and were one of a small handful
                    of Latin American countries to maintain diplomatic relations with them. They
                    opposed us vehemently in Central America. Even when Jimmy Carter was President
                    and there was movement on the Panama treaties, they were still sticking their
                    fingers in our eyes on all sorts of other issues. A few years earlier they even
                    supported the infamous U.N. resolution that equated Zionism with racism.</p>
                <p>In those days, they were just an unfriendly country that complicated our
                    relations with other Latin American countries. Whatever we were for, they were
                    against. They had a huge impact on their hemispheric neighbors. No leader dared
                    to agree in public with the U.S. on any foreign policy issue, for fear of being
                    accused by the Mexicans of “selling out to the gringos.” They always had to be a
                    little more anti-American than anybody else, particularly on political issues
                    that they felt would not affect bilateral relations too much. That was the only
                    way they could show their independence from the U.S. even though, of course, on
                    the economic side they were almost totally dependent on us and painfully aware
                    of it. Things really started heating up in Mexico when Jose Lopez Portillo
                    became President. Mexico became a big oil producer, the narcotics issue began to
                    rear its ugly head and before long big-time corruption entered into the picture.
                    Mexican banks were nationalized. Then their currency, the peso, collapsed. (For
                    the first time). A few years after that, as the global economy began to take
                    shape, they finally realized that relations with the U.S. had to be totally
                    turned around.</p>
                <p>Q: When you came first to the Latin American desk of USIA in 1978, what was the
                    feeling about the Sandinistas at that time? Was it a little bit rosy colored, we
                    could do business with these people?</p>
                <p>DACHI: I would say that there was always a great deal of suspicion that we
                    couldn't work with these people. In other words, it wouldn't be fair to accuse
                    Jimmy Carter of having been taken in or siding with the Sandinistas. I don't
                    think that's true. I remember very clearly because I was directly involved in
                    this particular thing, the Sandinistas' first argument was, “We want to be
                    friends with the United States, but you have to understand that we are not
                    responsible for the debts of the Somoza government and you are going to have to
                    give us a lot of economic assistance to atone for your past sins, plus we
                    deserve it.” The Carter administration had its doubts whether we could work with
                    the Sandinistas, but decided to give the constructive approach a chance. They
                    patiently started working with Congress to come up with an aid package for
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>As soon as Congress approved a modest aid program, it became high priority for us
                    to monitor whether they were going to publicly give us credit for it and stop
                    attacking us so ferociously about our past support for Somoza, whether it was
                    going to have any impact on their policies, whether they were going to continue
                    to be “buddy-buddy” with the Cubans, and whether it was true that they had
                    accepted Soviet and North Korean advisors. National Security Advisor Zbigniew
                    Brzezinski wanted to make sure that the “comandantes,” as the top Sandinistas
                    were called, didn't just quietly pocket the aid and continue to openly side with
                    their leftist allies. Most importantly, Congressional approval of the aid was
                    specifically conditioned on the Sandinistas not providing military assistance to
                    their fellow guerillas in neighboring El Salvador, where an insurgency was
                    getting underway. He wanted to keep an eye on that.</p>
                <p>Brzezinski asked USIA to give him a weekly summary of everything that was said in
                    the Nicaraguan media about the United States, about any assistance we gave them,
                    and about relations with their communist friends and allies. I ended up with the
                    task of putting that summary together. I remember making a trip down there. I
                    arranged to get FBIS reports, Managua newspapers, and asked our FSNs to send
                    media summaries. I would go through a mountain of material, track every word
                    uttered by the Sandinista leaders as reported in the media and systematically
                    catalogue what they had to say on all these issues. We would boil this down into
                    a one page summary that was sent to Brzezinski every week. Most of the stuff in
                    those reports was not what the White House was hoping to hear. The tone of the
                    comandantes' public utterances as well as the substance of their actual deeds
                    did not change much. Our aid program was virtually never mentioned.</p>
                <p>By the time of the 1980 Presidential election, there was already a lot of
                    evidence piling up that in spite of the fact that we had conditioned our aid,
                    the Sandinistas were helping the Salvadorean guerrillas, materiel was filtering
                    across the border and they were, in fact, surreptitiously but wholeheartedly
                    cooperating with them. Some warnings were already going out, even before the
                    election, saying, “Hey, you do this and we're not going to be able to continue
                    with the aid.”</p>
                <p>Between the election and Ronald Reagan's inauguration, these things started to
                    come to a head. I was down there on a trip at the time. I personally witnessed
                    some of these things. Robert White was our ambassador in El Salvador. I was
                    present at a country team meeting when he said, “There is no doubt the
                    Sandinistas are giving aid to the FMLN, as the Salvadorean guerrilla front was
                    called, and this is going to screw everything up. We can't allow this to
                    happen.” He called a press conference to say it publicly. After he left there,
                    he spent the rest of his life bitterly denouncing the Reagan administration's
                    subsequent policy toward Nicaragua. But he was the first guy, and I heard him
                    myself, fingering the Sandinistas at that press conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The ambassador to Nicaragua was Lawrence Pezzulo, a brilliant man who was an
                    outstanding ambassador. He was doing all he could to make it clear to the
                    Sandinistas that continued aid to the FMLN was going to bring on a serious
                    crisis in our relations. This also happened before the inauguration. I was
                    present at a dinner at the Residence, and I heard him tell the Sandinista
                    leaders directly that aiding the Salvadoreans was going to result in the
                    suspension of our aid and that Ronald Reagan was not going to let it pass
                    without a vigorous response. After the inauguration that is indeed what
                    happened. Both of those ambassadors were replaced soon after Reagan's
                    inauguration. I think they both did an excellent job in the transition, although
                    neither one could support the new policies of the Reagan administration. I also
                    remember being at an event in Washington prior to the inauguration, where I sat
                    with a friend who was to become the Latin American director of the National
                    Security Council who told me something to the effect that “Soon after Ronald
                    Reagan is inaugurated, you are going to see a group set up, armed, and trained
                    to combat and try to overthrow the Sandinistas.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: This was Roger Fontaine. He told me outright that it was going to happen.
                    The consequences of that fateful decision came to have a major historical impact
                    on our foreign policy for the next ten years. Its roots lay not only in the deep
                    distaste of the Sandinistas but also in the strong accumulating evidence that
                    they were not going to be content with taking over Nicaragua but were already
                    actively engaged in trying to spread their revolution to El Salvador. In effect,
                    it was a reprise of the “domino theory,” and not without justification.</p>
                <p>In subsequent years, I was drafted for many public affairs shows that were put on
                    regularly by Ollie North at the White House explaining or “ selling” the Reagan
                    Central American policy. (That was well before the days when the “Iran-Contra”
                    issue surfaced.) I became the USIA point person at these briefings. I was also
                    sent around to give lectures and explain the policy throughout Latin America and
                    several countries in Europe, including Socialist International meetings in Spain
                    and Finland. It was not a very popular policy, to put it mildly, and I had a
                    rude initiation to what it was like to face hostile audiences. I was thrown to
                    the lions, in a manner of speaking. I was certainly easily dispensable. But, to
                    be honest with you, I sort of enjoyed the task. I love being involved in a
                    passionate political debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a designated target.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I was a designated target. I went in there and did my best. I mixed it up
                    with the best of them. Larry Pezzulo, whom I admired greatly, never forgave me
                    for it. My position was, I work for the U.S. government. I have been designated
                    as a spokesperson. I am going to go out there and be the most articulate
                    spokesperson that I can be for the policy of my government. Larry felt that was
                    not correct, that I should have refused to do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Q: Can you tell me about the transition in USIA? I have lots of people who were
                    in ARA in the Department of State during the transition period between the
                    Carter and Reagan administration, whereas in Africa, the Near East, and European
                    Affairs, it was a fairly peaceful thing. There was almost blood in the corridors
                    in Latin America. What about USIA?</p>
                <p>DACHI: That didn't happen there. I was deputy area director in thCarter
                    administration and became director in the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you attribute this? It was a hostile takeover in
                        ARA ithe State Department, no ifs, ands, or buts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: There were a couple of reasons. First of all, the State Department is a
                    hell of a lot more important than USIA. It is something that any administration
                    watches closely and USIA is something that it pays attention to rarely, if ever.
                    But that is only a small part of the story. The Reaganauts were all convinced
                    that “the liberals at the State Department” were responsible for everything that
                    had gone wrong in Central America.</p>
                <p>The first guy to get slaughtered even though he was totally innocent, was Bill
                    Bowdler. He got a phone call out of the blue on the first day of the new
                    administration and was bluntly and unceremoniously told he had twenty-four hours
                    to clear out of his office. Nothing further was said. Bill Bowdler was a
                    consummate professional with an impeccable track record as a diplomat and
                    ambassador. He was absolutely apolitical, a man with the highest standards of
                    ethics and integrity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That was just unconscionable what they did to him. On personal grounds,
                    there was absolutely zero justification, none whatsoever. It is one of the most
                    blatantly unfair things that I have seen in all the years. He didn't deserve to
                    die such an ignominious political death for the perceived sins of his superiors
                    and associates.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The deputy assistant secretary who aroused their ire more than anyone else was
                    Jim Cheek. They were just as bitterly and viciously vindictive against him. The
                    rest of the people just sort of disappeared on their own. His story is a
                    fascinating one. He spent the next twelve years in “deep exile,” first at Tufts
                    University, then as deputy chief of mission in Nepal and finally as charg�
                    d'affaires in Ethiopia. Toward the end of the Bush administration he finally
                    gave up and decided to retire. He went back to his home in Little Rock,
                    Arkansas. Imagine his surprise when his fellow Arkansan, whom he knew from
                    earlier days, became President of the United States. Next thing you know,
                    President Clinton put him in charge of the transition at the State Department.
                    How about that for “the last shall become first.” Soon thereafter, he became
                    ambassador to Argentina.</p>
                <p>At the time of the “massacre of 1981,” Jim Cheek was the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary responsible for Central America. He was the lead person in
                    articulating the Carter policy for that region, which he believed in and fully
                    supported. He would go down to Central America and lecture to business people
                    about their “reactionary attitudes” and preach to them about acquiring a social
                    conscience. So, when Roger Fontaine and these guys came in, they really zeroed
                    in on Jim Cheek more than anybody. He had been outspoken on the opposite side of
                    every issue they believed in. He was particularly vocal in denouncing human
                    rights violations by the Central American military. There was a cutoff of
                    military cooperation with El Salvador in the Carter administration, which was
                    very controversial. He was a point person for that, although the principal
                    author of the policy was Pat Derian, the Assistant Secretary for Human
                    Rights.</p>
                <p>The linkage between military assistance and human rights has been, and still is
                    the cause of bitter divisions in the foreign affairs community. The rationale
                    for our military assistance and training programs always was that it is the best
                    tool for gaining access and influence with foreign military leaders, the better
                    to inculcate them with support for democracy and respect for human rights. Cut
                    that aid off, and we lose all chances to advocate our views, thus taking off the
                    restraints on potential military coup leaders and human rights violators. And
                    back in those days, military regimes were in power in a lot of Latin American
                    countries. The other side of that coin has been visible in many battles in
                    Congress over the years about cutting off funds for the U.S. Army School of the
                    Americas. Those who have fought for that cutoff argue that our training and
                    assistance programs, far from restraining them, have aided and abetted Latin
                    America's military dictators and human rights violators.</p>
                <p>Pat Derian was adamant about cutting off military aid to all Latin American
                    military regimes throughout the Carter years. Among those whose aid was cutoff
                    were the military in El Salvador. By the time the FMLN guerrillas became a major
                    threat there, the military, with nothing to hope for by way of aid from the
                    U.S., threw all restraints to the winds and became the most egregious human
                    rights violators in the hemisphere. Thousands were killed, with a number of
                    American clerics among them.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>That unleashed the justified fury of many human rights and religious groups in
                    the U.S. But it would have been heresy in those days to ask the question “If we
                    had continued to work with the military instead of turning them into pariahs,
                    could any of this have been avoided?” Pat Derian would never abide it. Whatever
                    the merits of the issue, a large part of the Reaganauts' anger against Jimmy
                    Carter's Latin Americanists and the personnel purges that followed could be laid
                    at the doorstep of this watershed issue. They blamed that policy for allowing
                    the Salvadorean guerrilla problem to get out of hand and providing the
                    Sandinistas with an opening to get involved.</p>
                <p>Another thing that bothered the Reaganauts was that most of the Latin
                    Americanists at U.S. universities were considered to be leftist liberals and
                    were exercising inordinate influence in the Carter administration. When Reagan
                    came in, the few prominent people from academia with a conservative bent came
                    out of the woodwork and joined the administration. Foremost among them was Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick, one of the few who was actually quite well known and did in fact
                    enjoy considerable respect both as a conservative and as a professor at
                    Georgetown University. She was very critical of what she called the “blame
                    America firsters.” That referred specifically to all those “leftist” academics
                    who were the bane of the Reaganauts' existence. Then there were a bunch of other
                    conservative Republicans with academic credentials who over the years had not
                    achieved many tenured professorships at the “better” universities in the U.S.,
                    or so the reasoning went, because of their political leanings. As they saw it,
                    they were locked out by a closed, elitist circle of leftist academics who were
                    king of the hill on most of these campuses. There was blood in the water.
                    Several became ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of them were at the University of Arizona and the
                        Universitof New Mexico, not exactly in the center of academia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: They always felt embattled. They were never accepted by the powerful
                    people who ran the establishment of academic Latin Americanists. They came in
                    with a vengeance as ambassadors, Jim Theberge and several others.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I recall an interesting little anecdote that happened to me at that time, in the
                    months before the Reagan inauguration. Sometimes you get credit for great things
                    you don't really deserve, just like sometimes you take the blame for things you
                    don't deserve either. In this case, I got the credit for something that,
                    admittedly I did, but I was barely conscious of. USIA had a speakers program,
                    called “American Participants.” Prominent people in various fields were sent
                    overseas as lecturers. In election years, they usually included speakers
                    representing the views of both parties. They would speak around the world on the
                    election process. I was the deputy area director then. One day, a memo came my
                    way. Would I sign off on a new list of proposed speakers? Two of the speakers
                    were Jeane Kirkpatrick and Roger Fontaine, who were supposed to go to Latin
                    America to talk about what Ronald Reagan's foreign policy would be if he became
                    President. This was always an important part of our election year program. We
                    were supposed to send people from both sides. I can confess now, I didn't know
                    who these people were. I just signed off on the whole list. They were all
                    academics. They went over there. Jeane Kirkpatrick in particular, was quite
                    outspoken in Argentina and Uruguay. She said that Latin American policy under
                    Ronald Reagan would totally change, which was the truth. She spelled out very
                    clearly all the ways in which it would change. And, it did, in fact, change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of her basic themes was, we should stop beating up on
                        thesdictators because there really isn't much to replace them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. One of her most memorable statements was when she drew a
                    distinction between totalitarian and authoritarian governments. In those days,
                    everyone knew that no communist government, once in power, had ever been
                    overthrown and no one could imagine that it would ever be, much less that it
                    could be changed by peaceful means. She argued that improving relations with
                    authoritarian governments was justified because, contrary to communist regimes,
                    there was a reasonable chance that we could help bring about some change for the
                    better or a transition to democracy. Subsequent events in Latin America proved
                    her right. But all this was anathema to Brzezinski. When he found out that she
                    had spoken under USIA sponsorship, he was absolutely enraged. He demanded the
                    head of the guy who authorized these people to go out. That was the first time I
                    even realized that it had been me who authorized this. It was so routine at the
                    time that I never focused on it. As it turned out, the senior career officer in
                    USIA, the Counselor of the Agency, Jock Shirley, knew me very well. He went to
                    bat for me and defended me. First of all, he thought I had acted correctly. He
                    went head to head with Brzezinski and said, “Leave this guy alone. He was doing
                    what he was supposed to do.” So, I survived. Then when this became known to
                    Jeane Kirkpatrick and Roger Fontaine after the Reagan inauguration, they thought
                    they had discovered a stealth sympathizer, a kindred spirit who had been a mole
                    in the Carter administration. What was I going to tell them, that I didn't know
                    what I was doing?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Charles Wick coming in as the Director of USIA?
                        Diyou feel his hand at all in Latin America in what you were dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I most certainly felt his hand, but in Latin America I felt the hand of a
                    lot of people, his being far from the heaviest. I was the guy who was carrying
                    the water in USIA on Latin America, so all the ideologues from the new
                    administration were telling me what to do. Wick did not involve himself that
                    much in Latin America, and he was never anything but correct with me. He was
                    trying to remake USIA into the most effective instrument to make his friends,
                    Ronnie and Nancy (Reagan) look good. He was a colorful personality with a very
                    idiosyncratic style. He infuriated a lot of people by the way he worked,
                    including me at times, and he could be very unkind to people on his staff.. But
                    he didn't see himself as an institutional leader. He saw himself as a man who
                    was out there to get this thing to work for Ronald Reagan. He certainly was not
                    an expert in institutional management. But in spite of his shortcomings, when
                    all was said and done, he got USIA more money and visibility than any of his
                    predecessors or successors in recent times. He left USIA with a global
                    television capacity that it couldn't have gotten any other way and, for or
                    better or worse, aroused a degree of interest in Congress that no one has been
                    able to equal since. USIA would certainly not have been “consolidated” into the
                    State Department if he was still at the helm.</p>
                <p>Wick acquired a reputation in foreign affairs circles as a bit of a laughing
                    stock. That doesn't mean, however, that anyone forgot who his patrons were. His
                    wife in particular was a close personal friend of Nancy Reagan. Even when they
                    were in the White House, the Reagans had Christmas Eve dinner at the Wicks' home
                    every year. For Christmas dinner, the Wicks went to the White House. So people
                    knew better than to trifle with Charlie Wick. Directors of USIA used to attend
                    the Secretary of State's weekly meeting. Wick didn't exactly acquit himself
                    honorably in those meetings. He certainly wasn't a foreign policy specialist,
                    nor did he pretend to be. There were a lot of things he wasn't interested in and
                    in those areas he let other people run the agency. On the other hand, he would
                    fall in love with producing certain television spectaculars that he thought
                    would make a global impact.</p>
                <p>There was the famous case early on, when the communists clamped down on Lech
                    Walesa in Poland. Wick ordered up a television production called “Let Poland Be
                    Poland.” It was a tacky political propaganda film and it bothered a lot of
                    people that such a thing was made by USIA. But it was a Reagan priority to
                    support Lech Walesa. When the Soviets shot down a Korean airliner, he put
                    together a TV program that was played at the UN and showed the world the
                    culpability and perfidy of the Soviets. Some people also sneered at that, but it
                    did make the Soviet representative at the Security Council squirm uncomfortably
                    in public view. People say he politicized USIA, and maybe he did, but that was a
                    lot better than Joe Duffey, the last director, under whose addled bungling USIA
                    was allowed to disintegrate and be gobbled up by the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about some of the issues you had to deal with in the El
                    Salvador/Nicaragua period from 1981 to 1984. You became the spokesperson in
                    USIA. I go back to Vietnam, where I served. We had a tremendous USIA presence
                    there in dealing with Vietnam. Was there a comparable proportionate reallocation
                    of personnel and funds onto Nicaragua and El Salvador?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes, there was, and to Honduras as well, where the Contras were based.
                    There was a huge permanent media presence in these places. It was vitally
                    important to us to present our side of the highly contentious issues in play as
                    effectively as possible. We were “crashing” on some crisis or another every
                    single day. In that sense, the similarities to Vietnam were quite evident. We
                    provided public affairs support for the push for free elections in Nicaragua and
                    an end to human rights violations in El Salvador. We were trying to prop up the
                    fragile Christian democratic government of Napoleon Duarte there and later
                    trying to avoid a right-wing party that included the infamous Major Roberto
                    D'Abuisson, reputedly a notorious killer, from being elected. But it happened
                    anyway. We were heavily involved in denouncing and exposing the murderous
                    activities of death squads in El Salvador and D'Abuisson was widely believed to
                    be one of their principal leaders. And, of course, keeping “the lid on” and
                    putting the best face on our involvement with the Contras in Honduras was a
                    never ending and excruciatingly sensitive task. There was a huge American
                    presence there, intelligence, military and otherwise, in connection with the
                    Contra war. There was a tremendous amount of time, resources, and effort spent
                    in “putting it in context,” providing the rationale, and justifying it.</p>
                <p>To this day, I think about my role. I can possibly be criticized for having been
                    overzealous. I thought of it as giving my best effort. My job obviously was not
                    to make policy, I don't recall having been elected to do that. I had a job to
                    explain the policies of my government and it was my job to do it as well as I
                    could. I thought of myself somewhat like a lawyer. You have a client, you know
                    who you're working for, what the policy is, and you put that policy into the
                    best light. In any event, I was politically more comfortable with the Reagan
                    foreign policy than I had been in the Carter administration. That doesn't mean I
                    agreed with all of it, but my personal views on these matters were beside the
                    point. So, even though there were people who thought that I was too vigorous, I
                    was out there advocating as well as I could.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find the fact that you had cut your teeth on the Panama Canal issue
                    with Torrijos that this was pretty good preparation? On the Panama Canal, we had
                    to do it. It was a messy thing, but we did it. It seemed to come out alright. In
                    a way, he wasn't the most wonderful person, so when you moved over to the rest
                    of Central America, none of the characters were saintly.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>DACHI: Yes, Panama indeed was good preparation for what lay ahead. But in many
                    ways the issues in Central America were much tougher. The main charge we faced
                    this time around was that we were trying to overthrow a legitimate government in
                    Nicaragua. That we had no place questioning its legitimacy even though it was
                    not democratically elected. That we had no moral standing to question the
                    legitimacy of the Sandinista revolutionary forces, because all we had ever done
                    in the past was to support the Somoza dictatorship. And, there was more. We were
                    “in bed” with a pretty questionable bunch of people in Honduras. Some of those
                    fighting on the Contra side were no choir boys either. In El Salvador, they had
                    all these guys in the army that had killed nuns, killed Americans, massacred
                    peasants, and killed the Archbishop of El Salvador, and we were powerless to
                    stop it. These were messy issues, to put it mildly. They were saying, “You
                    denounce the Soviet Union when it invades Czechoslovakia, but you don't hesitate
                    for a minute to intervene militarily in Central America.” It seemed to me that
                    there was quite a distinction there, but the critics were not inclined to admit
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk a bit about this European trip you made trying to explain
                    particularly to the socialist side. I have a feeling that, particularly on the
                    relatively moderate left of Europe, particularly at that time, there would be a
                    great deal of joy... It was almost automatic that they would come out against
                    the United States, whatever we were trying to do, and to overembrace the
                    Sandinistas, who had become the focus of the chattering class, the liberals and
                    the socialists. Did you find yourself up against this?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely. They really went after me about it in places like Finland and
                    Spain. At the lofty plane on which they considered themselves to be, it was
                    easier to be judgmental. And preaching to the United States was a popular
                    pastime, particularly in Socialist International circles. But, I also had a big
                    advantage. I was a small fish, and they knew I had no policy input. They felt
                    that here was a middle level bureaucrat sent out to parrot the administration's
                    policies, so there was no point in arguing with me. I wasn't worth engaging and
                    they were not going to push me too far. Besides, I did not rank high enough to
                    rate as a worthy dialogue partner in the eyes of these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit more about your dealings with
                        lieutenancolonel Oliver North?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>DACHI: I didn't have that many dealings with him. Wednesday afternoons, he used
                    to hold a public affairs briefing at the Old Executive Office Building on the
                    administration's Central American policy. From time to time, I would be called
                    upon to give a briefing on my most recent trip to Central America or whatever
                    experiences I or my staff had had with Salvadorean media, how the trip to Europe
                    went, how people were reacting to our policy, what I had to say to foreign
                    audiences. The group he gathered there every Wednesday afternoon, when you pull
                    together audiences in this town for this kind of a “dog and pony show,” there is
                    a whole list of people, former “something or others” who love to get invited and
                    will show up, particularly if it is at the White House. You can fill any room
                    with bodies in this town. Most of these people were “friendlies” to the Reagan
                    line. I don't think any prominent person in public life or the media ever came
                    to these briefings. It was a group of 30-50 regulars, a bit of a motley crew,
                    who just said, “Amen” to everything they heard. It was not a significant event
                    by any means. But it made Ollie North and his team feel better because they were
                    putting out their line in a forum from which the “poisonous leftist media” could
                    be excluded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever go to El Salvador or to Nicaragua during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes, several times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how things were going in those
                        twcountries when you were there? This was in the early 1980s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: There is no doubt that on the ground in Nicaragua what you saw was a
                    regime running things very much in the totalitarian communist style of
                    operation. I was born in Eastern Europe. I grew up there during the war and I
                    didn't emigrate to the West until after a few years of the Stalinist takeover.
                    So, I had some experience as to how these systems worked. My memory had been
                    refreshed in Hungary when I served there in the 1970s. There is no question that
                    these people were running a totalitarian regime in which individual rights were
                    violated and denied, people were arbitrarily arrested, their property
                    confiscated, put out of the way without much legal recourse. There was certainly
                    extensive cooperation with Cuba and a great deal of hostility to the United
                    States in Sandinista circles and the state controlled media. There was
                    absolutely no question that on the ground, whatever their protestations to the
                    contrary may have been, this was a Cuban-style regime, more so than an East
                    European one. I wouldn't flatter those guys by putting them in the same
                    intellectual category even with East Europeans party hacks.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>El Salvador was not a right-wing dictatorship as such. In fact, the president
                    during most of that time was Napoleon Duarte, a Christian democrat,
                    democratically elected. But there were always death squads beyond the
                    government's control that were killing people suspected of leftist sympathies on
                    the slightest pretext. There were constant human rights violations. The military
                    were particularly bloody and lawless. El Salvador was a place where we had
                    extraordinarily overburdened ambassadors who always had their hands full trying
                    to get the military to be more civilized, to get judges and lawyers trained in
                    human rights and observe the rule of law. It was a steep uphill struggle.There
                    was a huge foreign media presence there requiring constant attention. We had the
                    best and the brightest of our public affairs and information officers and the
                    best language speakers assigned all over Central America by that time. They all
                    had high pressure, challenging jobs and they acquitted themselves extremely
                    well. These were “career enhancing” assignments. For an official visitor like
                    myself, it was a fairly decent experience going to El Salvador. That was a
                    comfortable trip. Going to Managua was a hardship.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find in going to El Salvador... I speak with my experience when I was
                    in Vietnam where those dealing with the press, the American media, were
                    essentially dealing with a hostile power by this time, which was 1969-1970. In
                    fact, the American media there were mostly young people having a wonderful time
                    attacking the United States. What was your impression of the media in El
                    Salvador?</p>
                <p>DACHI: It wasn't that bad. Most of the time in El Salvador, there was a
                    quasi-democratic government. Dean Hinton was the ambassador. He was awfully good
                    with his media relations. It wasn't nearly the bitter situation that Vietnam had
                    been. I think that in Vietnam it didn't take long before it became very apparent
                    that this thing was wrong. That wasn't anywhere nearly as clear in Central
                    America. There were plenty of people who were opposed to it, but it just wasn't
                    as clear cut between right and wrong as it was in Vietnam. There were a lot of
                    journalists critical of U.S. policy, but it never got close to getting out of
                    hand.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, we weren't putting young American lives (there were exceptions
                    obviously), drafted young people, on the line, which made for a difference. The
                    reporters belonged to the same generation as the men who were doing the
                    fighting.</p>
                <p>DACHI: Without a doubt, the fact that American troops were not engaged in combat
                    there made it a much easier situation to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got out of this whole thing prior to the time when
                        what became known as the Iran-Contra Affair became known, didn't you? Oliver
                        North was arranging for money to go to the Contras and all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>DACHI: I left there in 1984. This Iran-Contra thing came to light a little later.
                    I don't remember exactly when. I don't think Ollie North was in bad odor yet
                    when I was there. I don't remember any public debate about Ollie North at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you feel about Ronald Reagan? He would sometimes make comments about
                    “If El Salvador, Nicaragua goes. Next thing you know, Brownsville, Texas is
                    under siege. These Contras are equivalent to the freedom fighters or to American
                    patriots.” How well did you think Ronald Reagan was engaged in and understood
                    the situation?</p>
                <p>DACHI: Ronald Reagan was Ronald Reagan. I thought he was a great president. He
                    was a decent guy who was sometimes given to these rhetorical excesses on cold
                    war issues that didn't make him or us look very good. But I always took it in
                    context. If you're in favor of a guy, you tend to rationalize away these things.
                    When it came to the main policy issues though, to Ronald Reagan the situation in
                    Central America was as simple as black and white. The “evil empire” of communism
                    was trying to establish a second beach head in our hemisphere and form an
                    alliance with Cuba. He saw that as a direct threat to our national security. He
                    may not have been engaged in all the details, but he was very aware of the “big
                    picture” and the implications were crystal clear to him. Occasionally, his
                    rhetorical flourishes or misstatements could be an embarrassment. I was on a
                    trip with him on a White House press plane once when he went to Brazil, Costa
                    Rica, and Honduras. When he got to Sao Paulo, he made a speech and said
                    something about how he was happy to be in Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any of us could do that. That is the awful thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I remember landing in the press plane in Costa Rica. Just before Air Force
                    One touched down, there were people at the airport with big signs saying,
                    “Welcome to Bolivia.” Things like that. Somehow, you could forgive Ronald Reagan
                    for these things because he was such a powerful president in so many ways. I
                    thought he was a great man. He wasn't always as deeply engaged in some of these
                    issues as you would hope a President would be, but he came just after Jimmy
                    Carter, who had been deeply engaged in everything to every last detail and
                    didn't exactly succeed at coming out on the right side of many issues. Panama
                    was an exception. So, I was a fan of Reagan's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the trip when he came out and said, “Gee whiz, I
                        hadn'realized how different these countries are?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I don't remember that.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the Latin American advisors in the National
                    Security Council and others who were playing a role, even USIA political
                    appointees?</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>DACHI: The NSC people were quirky and a bit far to the right sometimes. The
                    Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Panamanian exiles were playing an inordinately important
                    role in exercising influence over them, not to mention some of the conservative
                    republicans in the Senate. The NSC chiefs, Richard Allen, Judge William Clark,
                    the Roger Fontaines, the Ollie Norths and the other people, were focused
                    exclusively on the Contras, the Sandinistas, El Salvador and Castro, and
                    eventually on Grenada. The rest of South America didn't exist for them.</p>
                <p>Tom Enders was the first Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America in the
                    Reagan administration. He was a career officer and a brilliant man. He was
                    opinionated and overbearing at times, but brilliant, capable and very competent.
                    He was certainly not quirky. He was not the first, nor was he to be the last
                    Assistant Secretary for Latin America to be second guessed, overruled and all
                    too often disregarded by the NSC Adviser or his aides. Enders was followed by
                    another highly competent guy, Tony Motley. Motley was shrewd enough though to
                    sense as soon as the Iran-Contra thing started that it spelled big trouble. So
                    he got out of there in short order. He saw the thing coming and he got out. Then
                    Elliot Abrams came in, but his ship ran aground when his involvement with an
                    Iran-contra financial contribution by the Sultan of Brunei came to light.</p>
                <p>There are greater outside pressures from a multitude of lobbies and exile groups
                    with axes to grind on Latin America than for any other part of the world. They
                    always manage to get the ear of key people in the White House and Congress and
                    carry more weight than any policy input by the State Department. With the
                    exception of Bernard Aronson who served during the Bush administration, (we've
                    got him to thank in large part for taking Central America off the map as a
                    crisis center for U.S. foreign policy), Assistant Secretaries for Latin America
                    rarely managed to prevail over these powerful special interest groups and never
                    had as much influence on policy as they rightfully should have had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to Grenada. I assume it was a place you had to
                        loofor on a map.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Pretty much. Actually I didn't, because Grenada didn't totally come out of
                    the blue. The Maurice Bishop government there and his New Jewel Movement had
                    been an irritant, a thorn in our side, for quite a while. They were using
                    militant leftist revolutionary rhetoric, putting their words into action in a
                    way that was bound to raise red flags at the White House at a time when turmoil
                    in Central America was forever on the front burner. They were heavily involved
                    with the Cubans and brought in communist advisors from all over, including North
                    Korea. They were building a huge airport there, obviously financed with outside
                    money of suspect origin. They claimed it was built to facilitate tourism, but
                    that was patently disingenuous. It looked a lot more like a potential jumping
                    off point for Cuban forces which at that time were engaged in combat in Angola,
                    Mozambique and Ethiopia. That, in the eyes of the Reagan administration was no
                    small matter. What the real truth was, we will never know.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>As it happens, USIA ended up as a critical “bit player” in the Grenada story at
                    the time of the U.S. military intervention. Grenada came under our embassy in
                    Barbados, responsible for covering all the Eastern Caribbean countries from
                    Antigua in the north to St. Vincent in the south. Sally Shelton was the
                    ambassador. From Barbados, she traveled extensively to the other Eastern
                    Caribbean capitals to conduct our bilateral relations. When Grenada heated up
                    and Bishop became increasingly menacing to U.S. interests, Sally was instructed
                    not to travel to Grenada any longer, as a sign of our pique and a way to
                    downgrade the level of our relations. The only official American who could still
                    travel to Grenada was my public affairs officer in Bridgetown, Ashley Wills, and
                    he would do so on a regular basis. He was the only remaining diplomatic link
                    left. He became our main Grenada expert, and turned into a valuable political
                    reporter for the embassy.</p>
                <p>When it came time for the military action there, as you may recall, General
                    Norman Schwarzkopf was the commander of the Army contingent slated to lead our
                    troops into Grenada and Admiral Metcalf was the commander in chief. Your
                    question was, “I assume it was a place you had to look for on a map.” Well, they
                    did. Only they didn't have a map. Or at least one that was sufficiently detailed
                    and accurate so it could be used for military operations on the ground. Nobody
                    in our intelligence community ever thought we would need such a map for Grenada,
                    so they never made one. The stated purpose of the military action was to rescue
                    a group of U.S. citizen medical students, but nobody had a fix on exactly where
                    the medical school was located, not to mention other government buildings or the
                    bases or barracks of the minuscule Grenadan army. But Ashley Wills knew. And he
                    was the only one who could be rounded up in a hurry.</p>
                <p>They came and got Ashley Wills out of bed at 2:30 in the morning and took him to
                    Admiral Metcalf. Next thing he knew, he was up in the Admiral's plane with him
                    flying over Grenada, pointing out where the medical school and the other
                    “strategic” points were, because there wasn't anybody else who had a clue as to
                    what was where. He was the one who had to draw up a “verbal map” of Grenada for
                    them and point out where things were. So, he became quite a key figure.</p>
                <p>I heard about the invasion probably about 24 hours before it occurred. The
                    decision had been made that the press wouldn't be allowed to accompany the
                    landing forces. The first landing force going in there did, however, take a
                    public affairs officer with them so that, when the press inevitably arrived
                    shortly thereafter, they would be in place ahead of them. I was instructed to
                    provide two officers. I secretly pulled out two of my best people, one from Sao
                    Paulo and one from Lima. One of them, James Dandridge, actually got there in
                    time to go ashore with the first contingent. As the days wore on, we had to
                    rotate a number of people through there rather quickly, even though the
                    operation was short lived. Some people refused to go because they were
                    philosophically opposed to the intervention, but we chose not to make an issue
                    of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>After the military phase was over, we opened an embassy in short order and
                    assigned a full-time public affairs officer. Everybody made noble statements
                    about all the great things we were now going to do in Grenada, to show how much
                    better off it would be with the U.S. as its friend instead of Cuba, help with
                    development, private investment and so on. But very little of that ever came to
                    pass. Eventually, Grenada sank back into obscurity, faded from the U.S. radar
                    screen and we closed our embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the initial time, was it a difficult operation to sell
                        froyour perspective or did it come out fairly well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: I didn't have any trouble selling it. I believed we were doing the right
                    thing. You could predict that every country in Latin America would automatically
                    come out against it and indeed they did. Somewhat surprisingly though, their
                    protestations were quite mild and pro forma. This was an interesting thing. They
                    felt they had to be against it because they have historically opposed any form
                    of U.S. military intervention in the hemisphere. But in this case, they seemed
                    to be uncomfortable making a big issue of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The colossus to the north.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: In this case, they were on extremely shaky ground because four perfectly
                    legitimate, democratically elected Caribbean governments had in fact formally
                    requested the U.S. military intervention. That included two of the more serious
                    governments in the area, Jamaica and Barbados, who could hardly be accused of
                    being habitual “yes men” for the U.S., along with two smaller ones, St. Lucia
                    and Dominica. True, Trinidad and Guyana stayed away from it, as did St. Vincent.
                    Nevertheless, the request was totally legitimate and came through the
                    Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). That may have been a small,
                    little known organization most Latin American countries undoubtedly had never
                    heard of, but that didn't make it any less legitimate. All its members were
                    democratic countries and all had democratically elected leaders, which was more
                    than you could say for many of the Latin American countries at the time. They
                    formally asked the United States for assistance. It was done legally and
                    correctly. Nobody was willing to acknowledge that, not Reagan's domestic
                    opponents nor the Latin Americans who always looked down their noses at these
                    small English-speaking Caribbean countries anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>And last but not least, not many people ever understood what drove these
                    Caribbean leaders to swallow their pride and take the unpopular step of asking
                    for U.S. help in the first place. The fact was that when Maurice Bishop (who by
                    the way was assassinated by one of his fellow revolutionaries some time before
                    these events) overthrew an admittedly unpopular but nevertheless democratically
                    elected Prime Minister, it was the first time that had happened since any of
                    these English-speaking Eastern Caribbean countries became independent. The first
                    thought on the minds of those leaders was “There but for the grace of God go I.
                    This could happen to me.” The precedent of condoning a coup against a legitimate
                    government was one they felt would be extremely dangerous to allow to go
                    unchallenged. They didn't want to fall into the same hole that so many of their
                    Latin American neighbors had languished in for years. Later on, when the tables
                    were turned and the Latin Americans were screaming bloody murder about our
                    intervention in Panama, the Caribbean countries just shrugged their shoulders
                    and said, “Don't ask us for support. You didn't stand by us when we legitimately
                    asked the United States to intervene, so don't ask us to fall on our swords for
                    you now.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you treat this reaction from the Latin American countries almost with a
                    shrug and say, “Okay, this is something that we're going to do. They'll get over
                    it. It's not really going to change things.”</p>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely. Our policy was: we have our security interests, we have valid
                    reasons and a formal request, and we're going to carry it out. These guys are
                    always going to be against us because nobody in Latin America can afford to be
                    publicly on our side whether they agree with us or not. If we're going to let
                    them bluff us out of everything we feel we have to do in our national interest,
                    we'll never get anything done. So, let them say whatever they like.</p>
                <p>Q: The American cause was helped by that one thing (I have a feeling you almost
                    must have bribed the guy.), the American student who got onto the ground from
                    the plane and kissed the runway. If they had come out and somebody had said,
                    “What is this all about? We were having a good time” or something like
                    that...</p>
                <p>DACHI: I never had any contact with those students. Obviously, it must have been
                    a group that included people of all kinds of political persuasions. Frankly, it
                    doesn't surprise me that some of them were relieved to get out of there.
                    Clearly, the potential for danger was there. I am sure some of them thought that
                    it was the wrong policy because they felt that we should have left the Grenadans
                    alone. What would have surprised me would have been if they all had reacted the
                    same way. It was one thing for students at Berkeley or wherever to fancy
                    themselves as radicals, at a time when it was very fashionable to march around
                    in political protest in their own country, surrounded by police who protected
                    their constitutional rights. But when you are in a foreign country where your
                    own rear end is potentially in danger, you are not going to be quite as flippant
                    when you see Uncle Sam coming to your rescue, even if you suspect that he may
                    possibly be overreacting. Besides, these guys were medical students, surely a
                    more staid lot than the philosophy and political science majors at Berkeley.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Q: I was not involved in this Grenada thing, but as a good consular officer, I
                    could see that it was a dangerous situation. Whatever other reasons, we were not
                    allowed contact and there were a bunch of people going around with a lot of
                    heavy weapons. The situation was basically not under control.</p>
                <p>DACHI: You were asking about a tough sell. I'll tell you what was a tough sell,
                    what nobody took seriously. After we restored order there, we discovered
                    mountains of communist country supplied arms caches. A huge effort was made to
                    photograph and document all the weapons that were seized and get the information
                    out for the whole world to see. Yet, nobody would look at that stuff, read it,
                    or believe it, even though it was absolutely true. So, that also gets you to
                    saying, “We should go ahead and do what we think is right, whether these people
                    believe us or not.” People only believe what they want to believe. If it doesn't
                    fit their preconceived notions, they're not going to believe it even if it's
                    true. So, first and foremost, we've got to act in our national interest. That is
                    what Presidents are elected to do.</p>
                <p>Q: I agree completely on that. It's nice to be concerned and hand hold, but at a
                    certain point, people with no real responsibility want to sit on the sidelines
                    and kibbitz and complain.</p>
                <p>Let's talk about your involvement from USIA headquarters with Cuba.This goes from
                    when to when?</p>
                <p>DACHI: It starts from early 1979 through about 1983 or 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your concern with it and also your observance of
                        how whandled this? What were some of the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Not too long before I came into the Latin American office at USIA, I don't
                    know whether it was a year or two years, we had opened the U.S. Interests
                    Section in Havana. There was from the beginning a USIS office in that interests
                    section. We had an officer there. I think the first one was Barbara Hutchison.
                    It was functioning a little bit like our USIS offices had functioned behind the
                    Iron Curtain, as one of the very few channels for talking to Cubans beyond the
                    highly restricted official contacts in various ministries. This was an Interests
                    Section, ostensibly a part of the Swiss Embassy. We didn't have formal
                    diplomatic relations as such. So, our little USIS outpost there was unique by
                    Latin American standards. It resembled what I had known in Eastern Europe, but
                    it was a novelty for Latin Americanists. I must say that USIS was then, and for
                    all I know probably still is even now, much more limited in what it can do in
                    Cuba than it ever was in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe, because relations
                    are so tense.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it that relations were so tense or that you had the Cuban-American
                    community, particularly in Florida, looking over your shoulders?</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>DACHI: The community has been historically the dominant, controlling factor in
                    U.S.-Cuban relations. When I was in Hungary, the Hungarian-American community
                    was rather influential. On a scale of zero to 10, it was about a five. It
                    certainly had a great voice in preventing the United States from returning the
                    crown of St. Stephen for more years after it made sense to do so than it should
                    have. But other than with the crown, it was not much of a factor. In the case of
                    the Cuban community and particularly the Cuban-American Foundation, they have
                    been and still are a decisive voice in every respect. They totally and
                    completely dominate U.S. policy toward Cuba. They have steadfastly stood in the
                    way of anything resembling a normalization process. They have been influential
                    way beyond their real importance with a lot of Congressmen and Senators and with
                    every President since 1961.</p>
                <p>The first time I got involved was when I came in as deputy director of the Latin
                    American office in October or November of 1978. No one from the office had gone
                    to Havana up to that time to visit our USIS officer. The people in the area
                    office seemed perplexed at having a post in a communist country, and had no idea
                    how it should operate. I think they were scared to go down there. With the
                    Hungary experience under my belt, I was more excited than scared about going.
                    So, in about January or February 1979, I went to Havana. At that time, the chief
                    of the U.S. Interests Section was Lyle Lane, who had opened the section a year
                    and a half to two years before. That first visit was sort of an orientation for
                    me, and I found it absolutely fascinating.</p>
                <p>I was intrigued by all kinds of things. The U.S. Interests Section came under the
                    protection of the Swiss embassy. That embassy was located in a modest former
                    private residence and consisted of an ambassador and a first secretary. The U.S.
                    Interests Section had 60-70 people located in the same large building that had
                    been the American Embassy until Cuba and the U.S. broke diplomatic relations in
                    the early '60s. It even had Marines in civilian clothes. From the time we broke
                    relations until we returned in 1977, the building was closed, with a lone Swiss
                    diplomat stationed there as a sort of custodian. When it was reopened, we
                    discovered some interesting historical relics. As I was taken on a tour of the
                    basement, I saw a series of doors and wooden partitions. They had names on them:
                    Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, etc. I learned that as each of these embassies closed
                    years earlier under pressure from the OAS, they all packed up everything, took
                    what they could with them and the rest, mostly furniture, they stored in our
                    basement. Those things were still there for the countries that had not yet
                    reestablished relations. It looked like a basement warehouse in an Alfred
                    Hitchcock movie.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>The embassy was on the waterfront, the malecon, as they call it. In the parking
                    lot of the Embassy there were these totally rusted out skeletons of American
                    cars that had been left there in 1961. Castro had made a point of never removing
                    them. As far as he was concerned, that was diplomatic property and those were
                    the Americans' cars. People long ago took the engines, the tires, the wheels,
                    anything that could be removed, but the skeletons were left there. With all that
                    saltwater in the air, they were totally rusted. It was an open air chop shop,
                    frozen in time, right under Uncle Sam's diplomatic tombstone. Now that the
                    building had reopened, the parking lot looked even more surreal. Although the
                    Interests Section had been reopened for at least a year and a half, they still
                    hadn't found a way to have those skeletons removed.</p>
                <p>It was apparent to me that there was not a whole lot for USIS to do. We certainly
                    couldn't have anything approaching normal contacts with journalists, which is
                    one thing that USIS was partially successful in doing even in the Soviet Union
                    and Eastern Europe. From a State Department standpoint, if all the formal
                    official channels are closed, you can still have a very useful channel through
                    the media, but that was really not available in Cuba. That was the first
                    visit.</p>
                <p>Several months thereafter, Cuban affairs burst to the surface in U.S. public
                    awareness, after a long absence. We are talking about late 1979 and into 1980.
                    There was a revelation in the media that we had evidence of 5,000 Soviet combat
                    troops on Cuban soil.</p>
                <p>Q: It was known as the Soviet Brigade.</p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. They had been there all along, ever since the Cuban missile crisis,
                    but somehow it surfaced at this particular point. This created quite a problem
                    for President Jimmy Carter. When Jimmy Carter took over, he had several foreign
                    policy initiatives in mind, among them that he was going to finally bring about
                    a Panama Canal treaty, which he did. He also had in mind that he would make
                    progress toward normalizing relations with both Cuba and Vietnam. The Vietnam
                    thing never got off the ground, but he was playing with the idea of doing
                    something with Cuba. This was just after the Panama Canal Treaty had been
                    successfully concluded and ratified. Then this thing about the Soviet combat
                    troops came out. So, National Security Advisor Brzezinski crafted a new, more
                    hard line policy toward Cuba. This was in the summer or fall of 1979.</p>
                <p>Then, to put a carrot with the stick, the President decided that we should look
                    for ways to expand people-to-people and cultural exchanges. On the one hand, we
                    got really tough on a number of issues. On the other, USIA was given the task of
                    seeing how we might expand cultural exchanges, even though there was plenty of
                    opposition on the horizon in this country even to that. I was given the
                    assignment to see what could be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I went back to Cuba and we actually worked out in late 1979 or early 1980 two
                    things that were without precedent. First, we were going to help sponsor the
                    visit of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company to Cuba. The Cuban National Ballet, a
                    highly regarded ensemble that was internationally famous, had come to the
                    Kennedy Center to perform under unofficial auspices several months before. This
                    was going to be a reciprocal visit and the Cubans were all in favor of it. With
                    the newly declared presidential policy, we were going to sponsor that trip there
                    in some discreet way without making a public announcement of our involvement.
                    Second, there was a privately sponsored art exhibit that was traveling to
                    several countries around the world. I am a little bit hazy on the details, but
                    it was an exhibit of fairly good quality sponsored by a consortium from the
                    private sector. We decided to send this art exhibit to Cuba. We got the
                    sponsoring companies to agree to it. I went down to Havana and we negotiated the
                    sending of this art exhibit that was going to be shown in the Casa de la
                    Cultura, the ideological “palace of culture” of the Cuban communist party.</p>
                <p>Then came the Mariel crisis followed by the presidential campaign of Ronald
                    Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Long before those cultural exchanges could actually
                    take place, these two events caused them to fall by the wayside. After Mariel,
                    going ahead with cultural exchanges became politically out of the question.
                    People at the NSC refused to acknowledge that the subject had even been raised
                    before. The private sector sponsors of the art exhibit withdrew their support as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Mariel crisis was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: This was a crisis of major proportions because Fidel Castro, for a variety
                    of reasons, opened the floodgates to tens of thousands of Cubans to get into
                    boats and sail across to Florida in all kinds of makeshift boats. By the time it
                    was over, there must have been at least 100,000 arrivals. Cuban policy always
                    had an element that believed the best way to deal with political opposition was
                    to let them go to Florida. Castro did that when he first came to power. He let a
                    lot of people go. That is how the Cuban community got started in Florida. I
                    don't think he ever dreamed that the Cuban-American Foundation would become that
                    powerful a political instrument. Then, for a lot of years, people couldn't leave
                    anymore. Mariel was a major decision on his part to open the doors once again
                    and let everybody go. This was something very different from the Soviet Union
                    and Eastern Europe. Those regimes considered it high treason for people to want
                    to leave their homeland, pull up their roots and go to America. In the
                    Caribbean, on the other hand, that was always an acceptable thing to do.
                    Hungarian intellectuals would have to face truly intolerable conditions before
                    they could tear themselves away from their home. That has never been the case in
                    Cuba or in the English-speaking Caribbean. People have always gone north with
                    the greatest of ease and a minimum of psychological conflict.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The events leading up to Mariel started with an invasion of the Peruvian embassy
                    by large numbers of Cubans demanding the right to emigrate. Somehow, they
                    managed to jump the fence of the Peruvian embassy. Within a couple of weeks,
                    there were hundreds of people on the embassy grounds, and the event created a
                    media furor around the world. (Ten years later a similar happening, the invasion
                    of West German embassy grounds in Prague by East German asylum-seekers became
                    one of the key turning points in the fall of the iron curtain). This created
                    quite a problem for Castro. Originally, his position was that if he's going to
                    let them go, he's certainly not going to let them go to the United States. He
                    might let them go to Peru. Well, Peru wasn't about to let them in. Then a second
                    alternative came up that maybe they could go to Panama. But Panama wasn't too
                    thrilled with it either. In the meantime, the crisis was growing and becoming
                    tenser by the day. There were hundreds of people on Peruvian grounds who had to
                    be fed, provided with sanitary facilities and given medical attention. They were
                    surrounded by security forces. We were trying to help and get other Latin
                    American countries, any countries, to take these refugees because we didn't want
                    them in the U.S. either. The bottom line was, nobody was willing to take
                    them.</p>
                <p>Castro kept saying, “Of course, it's the U.S. that's behind this.” Finally, he
                    said, “Well, if the U.S. was the one that provoked this, then let them have
                    them.” Since we wouldn't take them, he said, “Alright, we'll just put them on
                    boats and send them over there.” He started warming more and more to the idea.
                    He said, “Well, if these several hundred will go, why don't we let anybody who
                    wants to leave go?” The next thing we knew, this thing turned from a trickle
                    into a flood. It was at that point he opened up the prisons and psychiatric
                    institutions and put hundreds of mentally ill person and scores of criminals on
                    the boats as an extra measure of vengeance against the United States. That is
                    how the Mariel exodus came about.</p>
                <p>As soon as the first few boats started to arrive, it created a crisis in our
                    government. I was designated to be the USIA representative on the White House
                    Mariel Task Force. Technically, the USIA representative was the deputy director
                    of the agency, Charlie Bray, but I was the one who ended up going to these
                    meetings. It was one of the most interesting and memorable experiences of my
                    entire professional life. There were two types of meetings. A general meeting
                    was held every day at the Old Executive Office Building, where every agency
                    expected to play a role in dealing with the evolving crisis was represented.
                    Then there was a smaller group of fewer than 10 people that met in the White
                    House itself, in the office of the White House Chief of Staff Jack Watson. I was
                    on that group also.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>The big group was an unbelievable scene. We sat at this huge conference table.
                    There must have been 20 or 30 agencies represented there from the State and
                    Defense Departments to the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, the
                    State of Florida, Health Education and Welfare, the Justice Department, the
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service, etc. There was an enormous number of
                    people. Jack Watson would sit at the head of the table and chair the meeting. We
                    would go around the table and everybody would say their little thing about what
                    their parochial interests were, how this thing looked to them, putting whatever
                    they were doing in the best light and, most importantly, clamoring for more
                    money because they had nothing in their budgets for this sort of thing. But the
                    administration had a national problem that it had to face. It wasn't going to be
                    able to address it by assembling 45 different people talking about their
                    agencies' own concerns, about what kind of tents they were going to have, where
                    they were going to put up the refugees, whether the Coast Guard is going to
                    steer them to one port or the other, what kind of immigration or refugee status
                    they were going to get, who was going to pay for what, etc. And, with every
                    passing day, a number of boats and people arriving was increasing by leaps and
                    bounds.</p>
                <p>At no time was there any hint as to what administration policy would be or what
                    the President wanted to do. Jack Watson never said a word about that. The key
                    question that nobody seemed willing to face was, were we going to let this
                    stream go on or were we going to stop it? That was an issue that we never came
                    to grips with in this meeting. But we kept on meeting every day. Every day,
                    there were more people arriving than the day before. The only thing that changed
                    in these meetings was that the people who were stuck with dealing with the
                    refugees had more and more acute problems: who is going to pay for this, who is
                    going to feed them, provide tents, transportation, deal with legal problems,
                    deportation? Where are we going to deport them to? How can we divert the stream
                    to Panama? Jack Watson just sat there and listened. Nothing ever happened. There
                    was never an outcome. Nothing was ever resolved.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile over at the White House, after several days of seemingly endless
                    procrastination, a decision finally appeared to materialize that this had to be
                    stopped. At our next meeting, we talked about how we were going to stop it.
                    Again, these 50 people at the big meeting couldn't possibly give a national
                    perspective on how this was going to be done without some sort of guidance or
                    directive from above. I remember going into a small meeting in the office of the
                    Chief of Staff. Under Watson's direction, we finally started talking about who
                    was going to do what. Watson was speaking for the President. What kind of steps
                    are going to be taken to stop these boats? How will the Coast Guard be
                    instructed to proceed? How are we going to talk to Latin American chiefs of
                    state to let them know that we did it, why, and how? Everybody was tasked to
                    carry out some portion of the plan.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>We were sitting there talking about this in the most serious and intense way when
                    a secretary came in and slid the Chief of Staff a piece of paper. He looked at
                    it and turned pale. He said, “The President just made a speech this morning and
                    said 'Open hearts, open arms. We can't let these people perish on the high seas.
                    We're going to let them all in.'” Jack Watson and everybody else there from the
                    NSC was absolutely speechless. They had no idea that Jimmy Carter was even
                    giving a speech that day, much less that he was going to mention Mariel. Nobody
                    had an inkling that the President was going to announce a total reversal of the
                    policy which we were talking about implementing. And we were sitting in a room
                    only a few feet from the Oval Office. Instead of keeping these people out, those
                    who were already on the high seas that is, as well as those who were already
                    ashore, we were now going to let them in and let them stay. (After that, the
                    Coast Guard would have orders to interdict all other boats that left Cuba
                    subsequent to this decision). Literally, nobody knew what to say. They said,
                    “Well, I guess we can end this meeting.” That meeting, I'll never forget as long
                    as I live. I could have never imagined something like that happening.</p>
                <p>Q: I think you're putting your finger on what was conceived by many people to be
                    a really major fault with Jimmy Carter, that he would let his heart take over
                    from his mind or something from time to time. There was a very famous thing
                    where he was pushing the Europeans, particularly the Germans, very hard to
                    accept what had been called the neutron bomb. It was a type of weapon. Then
                    overnight, after getting everybody on board and putting a great deal of pressure
                    on them, he changed his mind, purportedly because his daughter had said, “Maybe
                    we ought to do something else.” Among many government workers, myself included,
                    Jimmy Carter was not considered a very stable person (not crazy). He just was
                    too emotional on things.</p>
                <p>DACHI: This was certainly my baptism by fire into that reality. After that, our
                    Mariel task forces stopped meeting. Not too long ago we were still reading about
                    the criminals who were kept for years in U.S. prisons, a few of whom eventually
                    were repatriated. Then we had sort of a reprise recently at our base in
                    Guantanamo with Cuban and Haitian refugees. So, that was a memorable experience
                    with Mariel.</p>
                <p>Between Mariel and the election campaign, all thoughts of cultural exchanges
                    disappeared. After Ronald Reagan became President, our policy became even more
                    hardline. By the time of his inauguration in 1981, I had become area director
                    for Latin America and the Caribbean. I thought it was time to go to Cuba again
                    to see how our USIS program was going. After all, we routinely visited all our
                    overseas posts once or twice a year. But that was out of the question. You
                    couldn't even broach the subject with anybody at the State Department. Everybody
                    was scared of doing anything that could possibly be interpreted at the White
                    House as some kind of initiative toward Cuba. As it turned out, I wasn't able to
                    go down there again to visit our USIS program until early 1983. We all realized
                    there was nothing constructive to be done. When I finally got to Havana in 1983,
                    I just made a supervisory visit and spent some time with John Ferch, who was at
                    that time the head of the U.S. Interests Section.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I recall one revealing anecdote from the period. As area director in USIA, I used
                    to attend the Assistant Secretary's meeting for Latin America at the State
                    Department however often it met, three times a week or whatever. I lived across
                    the street in those days at Columbia Plaza. My habit was, first thing in the
                    morning, I would watch the news on the Today show and then walk across the
                    street to the Assistant Secretary's meeting. One morning, in about 1982,
                    somewhere in there in the early part of the Reagan administration, I saw a news
                    report that Fidel Castro had given another one of his long speeches in Havana.
                    The NBC report said he had made some remarks that could be interpreted as a new
                    opening toward the United States. I walked over to the meeting. It must have
                    been early in the Reagan administration because Jeane Kirkpatrick was our UN
                    Ambassador.</p>
                <p>In the State Department, at least in the Latin American bureau, which admittedly
                    from an ideological standpoint was the most sensitive, they had what I a little
                    irreverently called a “political commissar,” one of Jeane Kirkpatrick's special
                    aides, who was sitting in that office and attending every meeting to make sure
                    there was no State Department deviation from administration policy. (Republican
                    administrations always had a deep distrust of career foreign service officers
                    whom they considered to be invariably liberal and too far to the left). That
                    morning, there was some minimal discussion about the Castro speech. I don't
                    think anyone else had even seen the TV report. Maybe they had, but they didn't
                    mention it.Then this woman walked in. She was one of the Cuban-American
                    Foundation people, now an aide to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who was there as an
                    “ideological watchdog” in the Assistant Secretary's office. She came in and
                    said, “We have to get in touch immediately with the chief of the Interests
                    Section to make sure that he reports there was nothing new in Fidel Castro's
                    speech and there was no new initiative or opening whatsoever. The Today show
                    report is opening a can of worms. They are implying that Castro is going to take
                    some kind of initiative. So, it's essential that you get in touch with John
                    Ferch immediately and send him explicit instructions to send a cable that this
                    speech had nothing new it in and there was no opening or initiative whatsoever.
                    We don't want him sending us his own analysis.” That is the way she wanted it,
                    and that was what was done. Well, that was another memorable day for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: No reaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, nobody was going to fight this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>DACHI: No. There was not a peep. . I thought it was a watershed event.This was
                    one of the most egregious instances that I happened to witness, but I had seen
                    plenty of others at USIA when political appointees would put their foot down and
                    insist that the conservative ideological line prevail in every program decision,
                    choice of speakers to send overseas or the preparation of analytical papers.</p>
                <p>Q: Of course, sometimes you get something like this and then the bureaucracy
                    takes over and takes care of the problem, but not an open confrontation with
                    somebody who comes in.</p>
                <p>DACHI: The background to this is that a career officer named Wayne Smith had been
                    the chief of the Interests Section in Havana for a good part of the Carter
                    administration before John Ferch, another career officer, went down to succeed
                    him after the Reagan inauguration. Wayne Smith, a firm proponent of improving
                    relations with Cuba, didn't get fired as rudely as Bill Bowdler and Jim Cheek
                    had been, but he certainly was forced to leave, and he retired from the Foreign
                    Service shortly thereafter. Ever since, he has been a prominent, open and vocal
                    critic of U.S. policy toward Cuba. Wayne believed that normalization and
                    dialogue was preferable to confrontation, isolation and embargoes. He reported
                    honestly and conscientiously from Havana for the two years or so that he was
                    down there. That was unacceptable to the Reagan administration, so they got rid
                    of him and they sent John Ferch in his place. Ferch was a highly regarded
                    foreign service officer. He had been deputy chief of mission in Mexico and was
                    considered to be one of the most expert and sensitive analysts of Mexican
                    affairs. As often happens with senior DCMs when they're ready to become
                    ambassadors, there may not be an embassy available for them immediately. For
                    John, being “parked” in Havana as chief of the Interests Section was a nice
                    interim step.</p>
                <p>At the time they pulled Wayne Smith out, the head of Cuban Affairs at the State
                    Department was Myles Frechette, also a very able and substantive man. Myles
                    wanted to be and should have been the next U.S. Interests Section chief, but he
                    was a career officer and thus automatically assumed to be too liberal, a fatal
                    flaw in those days, and that was out of the question. He was ideologically
                    suspect just like Wayne Smith. He was, in fact, an enlightened normalizer as
                    opposed to a dogmatic confronter. Frechette was not gotten rid of, he ended up
                    as ambassador to Cameroon, but the Reagan administration would not allow him to
                    have an embassy in Latin America. Sending ideologically suspect Latin
                    Americanists to Africa was a form of subtle exile, less extreme than an outright
                    purge, that was often resorted to in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>They sent Ferch to Havana because they felt that he was not involved with Cuba
                    previously and he would represent less of a danger of freelancing there.
                    Dangling a future ambassadorship in front of him as a reward for not deviating
                    from official dogma helped to make the message clear. But at the same time,
                    Ferch was a brilliant guy, so the possibility that he would start acting
                    independently couldn't be discounted. So, they gave him specific instructions:
                    “Go down there and keep your mouth shut. Don't start getting ideas. You may
                    think that your job is to assess the situation there, report on developments and
                    add your policy recommendations. That's okay up to a point. But if you want to
                    be an ambassador, keep your nose clean and don't stray off the reservation.”
                    John did go down there and did keep his nose clean. He succeeded well enough at
                    it to be named ambassador to Honduras.</p>
                <p>Even so, Ferch went down in flames shortly thereafter. As the “Contra War”
                    against Nicaragua was going on and becoming more intense, Honduras became the
                    “privileged sanctuary” from which all the attacks were launched, and the contra
                    war was becoming a political bombshell in the U.S. John ran afoul of Elliot
                    Abrams, who by that time was the Assistant Secretary. Ferch fell into the trap
                    of thinking that now that he was ambassador, he could start exercising his
                    judgment and make policy recommendations. He was wrong. He ran into trouble with
                    the ideologues running the show, Abrams fired him and he left the Foreign
                    Service also. So, this was a rough and rocky road for some of the finest and
                    most experienced Latin Americanists in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that by the time you left USIA, our Cuban policy
                        was odead center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It was dead in the water and still is. It has gotten more hard-line under
                    successive republican administrations. Even democratic administrations like the
                    current one, President Clinton has not at all felt the need to distance himself
                    from the Cuban-American Foundation. Now they have two members of Congress from
                    that community plus the Helms-Burton Act. There is Radio Marti and TV Marti.
                    There is an ever stricter embargo. Then you had this Guantanamo thing with the
                    Haitian and the Cuban refugees and then finally the Helms-Burton Act which is a
                    secondary boycott that dictates to Canadians, Europeans, and other Latin
                    Americans how they can and cannot do business with Cuba. So, there has just been
                    a constant series of steps which have put U.S.-Cuban relations into an
                    increasingly rigid straitjacket. From 1978 to now, almost 20 years, this has
                    been the one place where our foreign policy has been totally consistent. We
                    haven't changed anything there in 20 years.</p>
                <p>Q. Let's move to Sao Paulo. Sao Paulo is a really major post. You went there as
                    Consul General. This by many is considered the equivalent to an ambassadorship.
                    It's of that rank. How did you get this assignment?</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>DACHI: Probably the way most such assignments come about. The Assistant
                    Secretary, Tony Motley, knew me from the time we had worked together on various
                    things when he was ambassador to Brazil and I was Latin America director. Then
                    we had worked together to some degree once he came back as Assistant Secretary.
                    He is the one who chose me and got me paneled to go down there.</p>
                <p>Q: There is the usual Foreign Service vs. USIA conflict over jobs. This is a
                    fairly high one. I would have thought this one would have meant that the State
                    Department Foreign Service would have fought on this.</p>
                <p>DACHI: The State Department Foreign Service will fight on things like this, but
                    if the Assistant Secretary really wants something done, the system has a hard
                    time stopping it. If you try to go through the system, if USIA decided to
                    nominate you by having the chief of personnel from USIA say to the Director
                    General “Here is a guy I think you ought to consider,” that is a different
                    story, you can forget about it. If the Assistant Secretary wants you, that is
                    something else.</p>
                <p>In those days, there always was a small handful of USIA people who through some
                    personal relationship they developed on their own with someone at the State
                    Department managed to get assigned to senior jobs, but there were very few.
                    There was no institutional cooperation on personnel matters whatsoever. Nowadays
                    there is more. For one thing, USIA has been ahead of the State Department as the
                    latter came under increasing pressure to give senior jobs to women and
                    minorities and there were many instances when they just didn't have as many
                    people coming up the ranks as USIA had. So, more USIA officers became
                    ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission.</p>
                <p>Leaving aside for the moment politically correct language, white males have not
                    necessarily had equal opportunities in the foreign service in recent years, but
                    even white males from USIA have held some top jobs. Christopher Ross, a USIA
                    officer, has been ambassador in both Algeria and Syria, as well as Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary and director of the Office of Counterterrorism. Bill Rugh, a
                    white male, also served as ambassador twice. Jock Shirley was ambassador to
                    Tanzania. Michael Pistor was ambassador to Malawi. Robert Gosende was chief of
                    mission in Somalia at one point during the war. One of the recent ambassadors to
                    China was a former USIA officer. It happened. There were quite a few. But the
                    point is that each and every one of them got these jobs through whatever
                    relationship they had with senior people in the State Department. USIA as an
                    agency never did anything for any of them to get them consideration in the State
                    Department personnel system. There are almost no exceptions to that. As for
                    minorities, Cresencio (Cris) Arcos is Hispanic, a very, very qualified guy. He
                    became ambassador to Honduras; Marilyn McAfee was ambassador in Guatemala. There
                    was also Kenton Keith, who was ambassador to Qatar. I got another job with the
                    State Department as DCM in the U.S. Mission to the OAS after my time in Sao
                    Paulo. That was also done through personal contacts from the Sao Paulo
                    assignment.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Brazil in 1985, what was the
                        political-economisituation as we saw it and American interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: U.S.-Brazil relations have always been dominated by economic, trade, and
                    investment issues almost to the exclusion of others, to a much greater extent
                    than most anywhere else. Brazil had had a 20 year period of military rule that
                    was coming to an end just as I was going down to Sao Paulo. We certainly looked
                    with favor at this transition to civilian rule, although we never exerted much
                    proactive diplomacy to get it to happen sooner. We got along quite well with the
                    military regimeThere might have been some minor exceptions, but not many.</p>
                <p>So, the U.S.-Brazil relationship has always had an unusually small political
                    component and an extraordinarily large economic component. One reason for this
                    is that Brazil is very sensitive vis a vis all of its Hispanic Latin American
                    neighbors not to be seen as some kind of a leader of Latin America, a
                    trendsetter. They always thought it was more important to promote their
                    interests in the economic sphere than to exert leadership in the Latin American
                    regional context. They were, however, somewhat interested in playing a greater
                    role at the United Nations, where they felt they were entitled to a permanent
                    seat in the Security Council as the largest and most important country in the
                    Southern Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>As I was saying earlier, the most important political and ideological influence
                    in the Spanish-speaking Latin American countries has always been wielded by
                    Mexico, until they got into the economic reform and liberalization phase in the
                    1980s. They were the anti-American ideological trend setters. They were the ones
                    that never broke with Cuba, the ones that voted for Zionism as racism in the UN
                    and almost always opposed U.S. Latin American policy initiatives, just to show
                    their independence from the U.S. This, in turn, was done to compensate for the
                    obvious and painful reality that on the economic side they were totally
                    dependent on the U.S. It was virtually impossible in those days for any
                    Spanish-speaking Latin American country to openly side with the U.S. on any
                    issue, for fear of displeasing the Mexicans and appearing to break solidarity
                    ranks.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The Brazilians always felt they wanted to stay out of most of that. They did to
                    some degree want to make it clear they were not under U.S. influence in any way,
                    and there is certainly plenty of nationalist sentiment in Brazil. On the whole,
                    however, they felt that the business of Brazil was business. They didn't want to
                    be Latin American ideological leaders. They were interested in exporting,
                    investing, expanding their markets around the world and keeping the
                    international banks they were “stiffing” on their massive foreign debt off their
                    backs. This has always bothered a lot of people in the academic and think tank
                    Latin Americanist community in this country, who all are much more politically
                    than economically oriented and are always looking toward giving the U.S.-Brazil
                    relationship a more heavily political character. It has never been in the cards,
                    not during the military regimes, not during the unstable civilian regimes that
                    followed, and not during this latest period of greater economic stability,
                    progress, and growth that has taken place in the last three years under the most
                    recent president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso.</p>
                <p>When I got there, two things were noteworthy. First it was the period when the
                    first civilian president, Tancredo Neves, was going to take over after 20 years
                    of military rule. He was not popularly elected, but indirectly elected by state
                    and federal legislatures. But he became ill and died before taking office. Then
                    Jose Sarney, who had been elected to be vice president, actually became the
                    first civilian president. So, this was an important historical transition.</p>
                <p>The other thing, the really big issue, was that about six or eight months before,
                    Brazil had passed the so-called Informatics Law that cut out U.S. trade and
                    investment in the area of computers and software and eventually tried to squeeze
                    the U.S. out of other high tech electronic market segments. This created quite a
                    problem. It ended up becoming the first case where the United States brought a
                    301 action for unfair trade practices against another country under the U.S.
                    Foreign Trade Act. From the standpoint of the birth pangs of the early days of
                    economic reforms and globalization, this was historically a landmark case. That
                    was just beginning at the time I got there. It was tremendously significant in a
                    process (globalization) that today is far down the road from where it was then.
                    That was a turning point. Those were the two things. I was up to my neck and
                    heavily involved in both of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The two issues...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: One was the conversion to democracy and civilian rule from the military
                    and the other was the so-called Informatics Law. Informatics means what today we
                    call information technology, everything that is computers, software, electronic
                    controls, information and telecommunications technology etc. They used the word
                    “informatics” in those days.</p>
                <p>Q: Why don't we deal with that first and then we'll go to the transition period.
                    Why and what was this law and how did it impact on us?</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>DACHI: This is really a big, terribly important subject. What was the thing about
                    this law? First of all, Brazil along with most of the rest of the developing
                    countries in Asia and Latin America, were still following the import
                    substitution economic model. These economies were basically closed and the
                    policy was to become as self-sufficient as possible by maintaining very high
                    tariffs, stimulating and subsidizing public and private domestic industry,
                    having huge state enterprises, and shielding the economy from foreign
                    competition. We still see these giant state enterprises in China and elsewhere,
                    including Western Europe. In Brazil, as we speak, most of the state enterprises
                    have been or are about to be privatized and the economy has been opened up.</p>
                <p>In spite of having a closed, protected economy, Brazil had an unusual amount of
                    foreign investment, more so than any other import substitution economy in the
                    world. This seeming contradiction was more apparent than real and was an example
                    of Brazilian ingenuity in trying to have their cake and eat it too. The case of
                    IBM is one of many illustrative examples. They were allowed in, but once there,
                    they became captives of the protected economy. They had to play according to the
                    anti-competitive rules established by Brazil, which of course was fine with IBM,
                    since they became its beneficiaries rather than victims. If they played along,
                    as IBM and the most of the others who were allowed in in fact did, other foreign
                    competitors including Japanese computer firms, for example, were kept out.</p>
                <p>The basic rule was that no foreign company could get in the way of any Brazilian
                    company that wanted to develop and dominate a particular market sector for
                    itself. So, outsiders were allowed to come in, invest, and do certain things
                    that Brazilian companies were not ready for or interested in, even though they
                    were a foreign investor. In return for being “good companies” and playing by
                    “Brazilian rules” they were then also protected against other foreign
                    competitors as if they were a Brazilian company. This was done for a lot of
                    industries.</p>
                <p>The historically significant point here was that once the high-tech revolution
                    broke out all over the world and started introducing personal computers,
                    software, etc., this by definition meant that you could no longer have national
                    barriers, and closed economies. It became impossible. No customs or tariff
                    barriers could possibly keep such foreign products out. For one thing, they were
                    absolute musts for any Brazilian company that had any hopes of remaining
                    competitive in either the national or global marketplace. Secondly, it always
                    was and still is child's play to smuggle such products into Brazil through
                    Paraguay and even in those early days contraband computers, software and
                    electronic products were practically inundating the Brazilian market via that
                    route.</p>
                <p>Brazil was the first and only country that thought it could control the “foreign
                    threat” from the high-tech revolution the same way they successfully did for all
                    the other areas of investment, just like all the other countries in Southeast
                    Asia, India and Latin America that were wedded to the import substitution
                    economy. The latter all stopped short, however, of trying to extend that to
                    information technology. That was a preposterous and unworkable idea.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>In the case of IBM, which was already there, they took away many of the rights
                    they had to make certain kinds of computers, and passed a law saying that
                    personal computers, mini computers, and a number of other products could only be
                    manufactured or assembled by Brazilian companies. They bought off IBM by
                    allowing them to continue making mainframes and certain large printers, and so
                    on, that were beyond the capacity of the newly-formed Brazilian companies, and
                    allowed them to sell those at three times the “normal” profit. In effect they
                    “bought off” or co-opted companies like IBM by cutting down their product lines
                    by two-thirds, and then allowing them to triple their profits on the remainder,
                    guaranteeing them a non-competitive domestic market and making the consumers pay
                    for it by keeping out all the alternatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the law passed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: In the fall of 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was just before you arrived.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. So, the main reason was to try to bring information technology into
                    the traditional system of economic control and protectionism. But there were
                    other reasons. We have to go back a couple of years to the Falklands War to
                    understand the background. The Brazilians had nothing to do with that war
                    directly, but when the Argentines managed to sink a couple of British ships with
                    Exocet missiles, one of the most up-to-date versions of missile technology at
                    the time, that they had bought from the French, everybody in Latin America was
                    ecstatic. I wasn't stationed in Brazil yet, but I happened to be traveling
                    through Bolivia and Chile. Chile was normally antagonistic toward Argentina, but
                    in this case even they were excited. For a few brief days everybody fancied that
                    missile as the great equalizer between the powerful developed countries and the
                    poor, underdeveloped Latin Americans. They wanted to believe that even a
                    relatively small country like Argentina, given a few Exocet missiles, could sink
                    the British navy.</p>
                <p>This had an incredible impact on Latin American minds. Who would have ever
                    thought that a Latin American country could face down a powerful Western
                    military force like that of the British. But what really happened? After they
                    sank the two ships and fired a few more missiles, they ran out of them and had
                    to get more. But the French said “No, there is a war going on. We're not giving
                    you any more.” The United States did its part, by weighing in with France not to
                    sell the Argentines more of the missiles. All of a sudden, Argentina woke up to
                    the fact that the “great equalizer” vanished into thin air virtually over night.
                    As much euphoria as there was before, now there was this tremendous wave of
                    revulsion that “These Westerners have got us again. When we really need this
                    stuff, they cut us off.”</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The Brazilian military drew their own conclusions. “See, you can't rely on
                    foreigners. We have to be self-sufficient in technology just like we became
                    self-sufficient in everything else. We can't let foreigners dominate high
                    technology, otherwise we can no longer assure our own national security. When we
                    really need it, they're going to see to it that our country is defeated in a war
                    just like they did with Argentina when the chips were down.” So, the idea was
                    spawned not just by the import substitution economists. In Brazil, the military
                    regime labeled information technology as a national security issue. That would
                    facilitate their subsequent decision to retain veto power over that policy, as
                    one of several preconditions to turning the country over to the civilians in
                    1985.</p>
                <p>The Generals were already aware of the fact that the time was coming when the
                    military had to step back and let the civilians in after 20 years. This had to
                    be a very delicately negotiated process, not only in Brazil but in every one of
                    the South American, Southern Cone countries. In Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay,
                    even more so than in Brazil, the issue of amnesty to the military officers who
                    had committed so many crimes and human rights violations while in power had to
                    be resolved before there was a chance to get them to agree to a return to
                    democracy and civilian rule. These military weren't just going to withdraw to
                    their barracks, let the civilians take over and be put on trial for their human
                    rights crimes.</p>
                <p>In the Brazilian case, the political compact that the military imposed as the
                    price for allowing the civilians to return was that the military would retain
                    residual rights in certain areas. One of them was to retain control over policy
                    for the Amazon region and the security issues, as they perceived them, that
                    played themselves out there. That included veto power over any initiative the
                    government might undertake to restrain logging and agricultural settlements in
                    the Amazon rainforest, and the attempt to rein in the rampant burning and
                    deforestation that was reaching new heights. The other was in high technology.
                    They were going to have the final word and absolute control over what happens in
                    the area of high technology. As far as the Informatics Law was concerned, the
                    word of the military was decisive, “Yes, we have to be self sufficient, so we're
                    going to build this into our closed economy and develop our own national
                    industry.” So, this was settled as part of the necessity of granting them their
                    residual rights in the last few months before they actually left office. No one
                    in the civilian domain, even had they wanted to do it otherwise, could have
                    stood in the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>There was a third area, a kind of mixture of politics, old, and new. Brazil has
                    always been haunted by inflation, the kind of inflation we can't even fathom, up
                    to 40-80% a month. One of the sectors that became astronomically profitable as a
                    result of inflation was banking. You can imagine what interest rates are when
                    there is that kind of inflation. So, to put it in the simplest possible terms,
                    if banks can take three days to pay a check that you wrote and collect the money
                    due to them in one day, that two day interval float between what they take in
                    and what they pay out, they make a hefty profit. Actually, that is also how many
                    other industries and companies survived in Brazil. Everybody was trying to do
                    the same thing: keeping their heads above water by collecting in 20 days and
                    paying in 30 or 40. You couldn't make any money by increasing production,
                    because of the inflation.</p>
                <p>For the banks, it was absolutely imperative to stay on top of the inflationary
                    process, knowing they could make a ton of money if they handled it right. The
                    way to make this thing work was to computerize the entire banking sector as
                    quickly as possible. They decided that the quickest and cheapest way to do it
                    was by developing their own domestic computer and ATM industry. So, it was the
                    banks that decided, with full government blessing, to stake three Brazilian
                    entrepreneurs to start up their own computer companies. They financed it, bought
                    the stock, and literally controlled it lock, stock, and barrel. All of a sudden,
                    three Brazilian companies popped up that were going to make Brazilian computers,
                    obviously with “borrowed technology,” to put it euphemistically, and they were
                    going to have a huge, instant, protected, guaranteed market in the banking
                    sector to help them get launched and compete against some of the most
                    experienced, technologically advanced and cost-efficient multinationals. Without
                    that protection, they wouldn't have had the ghost of a chance.</p>
                <p>Not surprisingly, countless Brazilian and foreign companies, large and small,
                    that had needs for thousands of new computers refused to buy these overpriced
                    second-rate Brazilian computers built with pirated, obsolescent technologies.
                    That was the beginning of a gigantic contraband operation that resulted in the
                    smuggling in of American computers through Paraguay, to the tune of an estimated
                    $300-400 million a year. But none of it made any difference. Brazilian
                    authorities turned a blind eye to it all for a long time, because there was too
                    much money to be made at their end of the operation. The three Brazilian
                    manufacturers were guaranteed to sell thousands of computers and all that goes
                    with them, including tens of thousands of ATM machines, to the banks that owned
                    them, so that the banks could automate their operations and lock in these
                    incredible inflation-derived profits. That is, in fact, what happened. In order
                    to do that, they shut down the corresponding product lines of their foreign
                    competitors, IBM, Hewlett Packard and what is now UNYSIS. They called the policy
                    “market reserve.” Those were the main ingredients and the hardball tactics that
                    signaled the inception of the informatics law.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>In 1985, the year after the law came into effect, nobody appreciated or
                    understood yet all the global dimensions and implications of what was happening.
                    We were just dealing with the minutia. Nobody had the context. I certainly had
                    no idea. But we knew that this law was damaging to U.S. economic interests. IBM
                    was the first to start complaining. There were many others who soon followed
                    suit. Soon enough though, many of them stopped complaining when they woke up to
                    the fact that the government would “buy them off” by granting them market
                    reserves of their own in product lines that did not impinge on Brazilian
                    companies' interests. Things got worse later in the year because after they did
                    it to computers, Brazilian policymakers realized that you can't stop there. They
                    moved on to software and the gamut of electronic products, optical scanners in
                    supermarkets, electronically controlled windshield wipers in automobiles,
                    computerized numerical controls for factory machines, and even computerized
                    system controls for entire industrial production lines. So, this grew like topsy
                    over the next 12 months. And in all these latter fields, buying off the
                    multinationals proved to be much more complicated than was the case with
                    computer hardware.</p>
                <p>It was very tough back then to really know how exactly U.S. interests were going
                    to be hurt. But by that time, there was something else going on in Washington.
                    Democrats in Congress led by Richard Gephardt began to accuse the Reagan
                    administration of not being sufficiently zealous in defending our commercial and
                    economic interests in other countries and not backing and supporting the
                    American private sector as much as the Japanese. In particular, the
                    administration was faulted for not combating unfair trade practices against U.S.
                    exporters vigorously enough. Remember that in those days the Japanese were seen
                    as all-powerful in international trade, due to heavy government support and
                    subsidies that allowed them to run circles around American companies. That
                    sounds pretty funny today as we have witnessed the vaunted Japanese economy
                    flame out in many areas, but it seemed real to a lot of people back then.</p>
                <p>Section 301 of the Foreign Trade Act was available to us to press for resolving
                    such unfair trade practice, and failing that, to invoke sanctions. The Office of
                    the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), was set up to deal with this kind of
                    thing, but the administration had chosen not to pursue any cases under section
                    301 up to that time. Now Congress was saying that they were going to take away
                    from the administration some of the leeway that over the years it had given to
                    the Executive Branch to deal with foreign trade. After all, in the Constitution,
                    that function is given to Congress. There was a concerted move in Congress to
                    tighten up foreign trade legislation and basically reduce the administration's
                    flexibility in conducting foreign trade policy on the grounds that they weren't
                    tough enough. So, by the summer of 1985, it became apparent to the White House
                    that in order to head off these congressional initiatives, it was essential to
                    find some device to start acting tougher and find some cases to invoke Section
                    301 of the Trade Act. That provision basically says that if a county practices
                    unfair trade practices, we investigate it, determine what that unfair trade
                    practice is and the extent of the damage it has caused to U.S. exporters, and
                    try to negotiate a solution. If we can't negotiate a solution, we apply
                    sanctions.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Sanctions have increasingly become a big part of our foreign policy, many times
                    in ways that I think are counterproductive, but at other times, they make a
                    certain amount of sense. This was one of the early steps in the intensification
                    of that process in the foreign trade field. By August, the administration
                    decided to bring a couple of 301 cases on an accelerated basis. It was deemed
                    politically imperative to head off Congress.</p>
                <p>So, in September, the first two 301 cases were brought by the administration. One
                    of them was with Korea. I'm not familiar with that one. The other was with
                    Brazil, specifically about the Informatics Law. It was obvious that this was
                    something new and had potentially far reaching consequences. There were a lot of
                    big American companies involved. The political decision was made at the White
                    House that they had to move quickly on a 301 because Congress was breathing down
                    their necks, and they picked this one. But because of the political urgency,
                    they rushed into bringing the case before they really knew very much about
                    exactly what the problem was in terms of the impact on U.S. companies.</p>
                <p>The Informatics Law was a great topic of discussion even before I went to Sao
                    Paulo. At the time, I didn't even know that there was a U.S. Foreign Trade Act,
                    but it quickly became apparent to me that this thing was going to be an issue in
                    our relations. Most of these companies and industries, both the Americans that
                    were being harmed and the Brazilians who were the beneficiaries, were in my
                    consular district. Sooner or later, I knew that I would have to come to grips
                    with this topic. At the outset I was completely ignorant. I didn't know a chip
                    in a computer from a chip in a chocolate cookie. I set out on my own to try to
                    learn something about the computer business from the ground up. I started going
                    around educating myself. By September, I had learned probably about five or 10%
                    of what I needed, but it was a start. It seemed to me that I had learned a
                    lifetime's worth, but compared to what was left, it was nothing.</p>
                <p>Somewhere in late September, USTR decided that according to Section 301 it was
                    time to start an investigation and prepare a report defining what our problems
                    were. Then we would have to go to the Brazilian government to try to negotiate
                    and resolve the problem. I ended up getting the task of doing this investigation
                    and documenting the case in an environment in which nobody yet had any idea what
                    the specifics of the problem were. Then, of course, they had to have it by
                    November 10th or 15th. There was no way on earth I could get it done by then,
                    but I did get it done by the end of the year. It was a hundred page report that
                    brought out a lot of information, although in hindsight it still only scratched
                    the surface of the totality of the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It suddenly occurred to me that, alright, we wanted to use
                        Brazil as a case to prove our point on trade matters and be tough, but at
                        the same time I could see people on the Brazil Desk saying, “Wait a minute!
                        We want to have democracy in Brazil and you don't want to put any pressure
                        on this government as it moves into democracy.” I would imagine that you
                        would get caught between these two. How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That was precisely the way it was developing. The Brazilian government was
                    trying its best to exploit that obvious division of interests. The Brazilian
                    attitude was that Brazil and the United States have a broad array of interests
                    across many issues. We are the two biggest countries in the hemisphere. We have
                    always had cordial relations working out a multitude of issues. Now they accused
                    us of trying to create a confrontation about some petty commercial details and
                    endanger the overall relationship.</p>
                <p>The State Department was always resistant to the idea of another agency carving
                    out a piece of the action for itself in foreign affairs. There was nothing they
                    could do when the agency involved was the Defense Department, but having USTR
                    moving into the picture in a big way, as was the case in this instance, was
                    definitely distasteful. The whole idea of contentious economic and commercial
                    relations muscling into the otherwise cordial U.S.-Brazil relationship, recently
                    warmed up after the transition to democracy, was not welcome. At the same time,
                    State was well aware of the fact that this was a White House initiative with a
                    lot of Congressional pressure behind it, so they treaded very carefully and just
                    tried to stay out of it whenever they could.</p>
                <p>It was a little bit unusual. Here was a major new issue between the two
                    countries, and State was content to stay as a mere observer in the background,
                    showing no more than a minimum of interest and allowing all the action to pass
                    to USTR. The agency that requested the original 301 investigation was USTR. So,
                    from the very beginning there was a gap between the State Department and USTR.
                    Our reports were going to USTR. Info copies were of course showing up in the
                    Department, but the people who were responsible for carrying the case forward
                    were in USTR. As is often the case in such situations, they were perhaps not as
                    diligent as they might have been in keeping the State Department informed. The
                    State Department was always a little bit peeved about not being totally in the
                    loop, even if they wanted no part in the reaching of any tough decisions. But
                    all of my phone calls and all of the things between Washington and, not only the
                    consulate general, but more importantly at the Embassy in Brasilia and
                    Ambassador Harry Shlaudeman, were per force done mostly with USTR.</p>

                <p>It was new for the United States to take such an energetic approach to dealing
                    with what in those days was defined as “unfair trade practices.” The Brazilians,
                    for sure, felt that maybe the U.S. government was not as aware as it should be
                    that it was really taking a whole new direction in its foreign policy. Today,
                    the administration deals with these issues with the highest priority as a matter
                    of course. Many of the issues today even in presidential elections such as
                    NAFTA, the World Trade Organization, and the trade surplus with Japan and China
                    are really front burner issues. But back in 1985, we were only at the beginning
                    of what has now become one of the dominant trends in our foreign policy. In
                    those days, it was new. It was new to everybody. The Brazilian government, I'm
                    sure, was not the only one. It must have been one of many that were waking up to
                    the fact that the kind of protectionist practices they had been following
                    without getting too much heat from the outside world were all of a sudden coming
                    under much more intense scrutiny and were going to move front and center in
                    bilateral relations with the United States. It started then.</p>
                <p>Q: Anybody serving in a country doesn't want to have an issue like this come up.
                    It makes it difficult. I would have thought part of the reaction from the
                    American side and maybe even from the Brazilian side, “Why us? Why Brazil? Why
                    not the most blatant one, Japan?” Japan was really sticking it to us on all
                    these things.</p>
                <p>DACHI: We were plenty concerned about Japan. But the reason that we were focusing
                    on Brazil was because Brazil, one of the most important of the developing
                    countries with a closed, import substitution economy, took protectionism to a
                    new and different level by extending it to the high technology computer,
                    software, and electronics areas. That made the case unprecedented in nature.
                    Brazil was the first and then ended up being the only country that tried to
                    bring all of this new technology under the old closed economy system. They
                    thought it was possible to bring high tech under the kind of protectionism that
                    everything else had been under. That was exactly why you had to take this on.
                    This was indeed plowing new ground. That was the reason Brazil was singled
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work out? What were you doing and how did you
                        seit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: The first phase was to really define the problem. That had not been done.
                    The Foreign Trade Act in Section 301 speaks of unfair trade practices. That was
                    the terminology at the time: unfair trade practices. That meant that countries
                    will play games with tariffs, varying interpretations of dumping laws,
                    countervailing duties, and things that have come to be known as non-tariff
                    barriers to spin the web of a protected economy. It turns out that we began
                    laying on the table what eventually became the starting point for what the World
                    Trade Organization is about today, even though it still doesn't include many of
                    the areas like investment and trade in services that need to be in there.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Trade is where it began, but it was only one aspect. Investment is another, in
                    many ways more important than trade. Brazil had a number of ways in which it was
                    controlling investment, making regulations about how joint ventures were to
                    operate, what percentage of equity could be held by foreign investors, how much
                    a multinational company had to export of products made in-country in exchange
                    for getting import licenses for components, raw materials, or intermediate
                    products. In the latter case, for example, the country would liberate foreign
                    exchange to bring in these components, but demand that the company export a
                    certain amount and earn back for Brazil some of the hard currency expended in
                    allowing the components to come in. So, one of the first points to come out of
                    our investigation was that unfair trade practices is too narrow a term. What we
                    were really talking about was both unfair trade and investment practices.</p>
                <p>We also expanded our database both on tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The list
                    of such barriers that surfaced in our investigation began to grow greater and
                    greater. One non-tariff barrier is the regulation I mentioned a minute ago that
                    says that if you're going to import, say $10 million worth of components, you
                    have to export at least $12 million worth of finished product. That way, you're
                    not going to undermine the host country's balance of payments. Every foreign
                    company had to agree to a yearly contract requiring specific export target
                    figures in each of the product categories they were manufacturing in Brazil.
                    More investors went into Brazil than into most other developing countries with
                    import substitution economies, because Brazil was the country with the largest
                    population and therefore the one that offered the largest domestic market. A
                    multinational corporation that wants to manufacture, which was the name of the
                    game in those days (Services were still small potatoes then), would be attracted
                    to Brazil because a large percentage of its production could be sold on the
                    domestic market where they enjoyed all kinds of advantages in price,
                    productivity, and efficiency.</p>
                <p>At the same time, there were always limitations as to the profits that could be
                    remitted, although these laws were generally quite reasonable. Brazil
                    represented an almost ideal situation for a multinational manufacturer/exporter,
                    because of the balance between a sizable domestic market and a favorable
                    geographic location as an export platform. General Motors would make
                    transmissions there. Half of them would go into cars sold in Brazil and the
                    other half shipped to other countries where GM automobiles were assembled,
                    including the United States. Export requirements in exchange for import licenses
                    was only the first step in the non-tariff barriers game. The next thing was,
                    they would say, “We're not going to license your bringing in a certain component
                    because we have a Brazilian industry that can make that componen(That was the
                    origin of the so-called National Similar Law.) If something similar is made
                    here, you can't bring it in.” Never mind if the quality or price of the domestic
                    “national similar” was competitive or not. That expanded our agenda of
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happened while you were in Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>DACHI: Some of these things were in place before, but we brought it all out into
                    the open, defined it, and put it all down on paper to show that there was a
                    whole mosaic of issues that came into play here with this Informatics Law. When
                    a foreign company couldn't import a P.C. and couldn't assemble one there because
                    only Brazilian companies were allowed to do it, that was a non-tariff barrier.
                    Even though IBM had a plant in Brazil, they were no longer allowed or licensed
                    to assemble personal computers in Brazil. As I said earlier, that was the
                    essence of the market reserve.</p>
                <p>The National Similar Law would come into the picture when a foreign company would
                    want to import a product or component and SEI, the Brazilian regulatory agency
                    would say, “There is a company here that makes that component.” The import
                    license applicant would retort that the part in question was not as modern and
                    didn't have the latest technology that theirs did. Then SEI would decide who was
                    right, almost invariably in favor of the domestic producer, and would deny the
                    import license. Foreign companies would argue that they couldn't export the
                    product if it contained second-rate components from the domestic market, and
                    they would no longer be competitive in the international market. Accordingly,
                    they couldn't comply with the export requirements Brazil was demanding in return
                    for import licenses. But the Brazilian regulators almost invariably retained the
                    upper hand. To overrule them required the personal intervention of the Minister
                    of Finance. Occasionally one of the big multinationals with powerful political
                    connections might succeed in winning out on a specific matter in the minister's
                    office, but that was only the exception to prove the rule.</p>
                <p>On all of these things, the Brazilians required the individual companies to deal
                    with them on a case-by-case, company-by-company basis, insisting on
                    confidentiality so that neither the companies nor the U.S. government could ever
                    compare notes on how this policy was implemented on a countrywide basis. They
                    did it pretty much surreptitiously. For USTR, this was new ground, to put
                    together a road map of what in fact was the entire gamut of unfair trade and
                    investment practices, and the specific regulations invented by Brazilian
                    regulatory agencies to keep the economy closed and to make it work in a
                    discriminatory fashion. By extension, these very same methods have been used by
                    many other countries and still are. So, we really began to produce a documentary
                    on the art and science of unfair trade and investment practices which USTR was
                    able to put to good use in many other countries over the ensuing years.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you go about getting the data? I'm talking about you as the Consul
                    General. You said you had already when you got there started to inform yourself.
                    Did you have economic officers/trade officers at the consulate general who could
                    help?</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>DACHI: We had a small but very good economic section with excellent officers. The
                    State Department tried hard to make sure that well qualified people were
                    assigned to Sao Paulo in this area. But basically I did a great deal of this
                    myself. As often happens, younger officers are really not in a position to take
                    the lead when it comes to carve out new policy ground or risk creating turmoil
                    with host country officials. I had some help from them, but I did most of it
                    myself. Later on, the second and third years, they started participating and
                    contributing more and more.</p>
                <p>How did I do it? I started first by just talking to the American companies. It
                    often took the Consul General to get these people to talk about things of such
                    political sensitivity. This was a new issue, and it was new for the U.S.
                    government to show such interest in the companies' dealings with Brazil. They
                    were initially very uncomfortable with it. Every one of these companies had been
                    there for years. Even though they were running into big problems in some areas,
                    they had other product lines and other things where the Brazilian government not
                    only allowed them to go on as before but would keep out competitors in order to
                    help them become more profitable in areas that were not of immediate interest to
                    the Brazilians. In exchange for being “good corporate citizens” and keeping
                    their mouths shut about the new restrictions that were being applied in the
                    high-tech field, they received more lenient treatment on other issues. So,
                    particularly the big companies like IBM and Xerox were very uncomfortable, much
                    more uncomfortable than the State Department, with this new administration
                    thrust to get tough on Brazil for its Informatics Law. They were afraid that a
                    huge part of their other businesses were going to be jeopardized because we were
                    pushing so hard in one area, without due regard to all of the others.</p>
                <p>The Brazilians very cleverly exploited this, just like they skillfully played on
                    the divisions among American companies later on when the debt moratorium came
                    into play. They, in fact, succeeded briefly in dividing the American business
                    community along several lines. Xerox would tell us, “Stay out of this. We will
                    work this out for ourselves.” The Brazilians would tell them, “Look, if you play
                    ball and you're a good citizen, we'll close our eyes to some of your other
                    practices. We'll keep such and such a competitor out. We'll let you charge twice
                    as much for this. We will give you an extra import license for something you
                    want in exchange for your getting out of this other field that we want to
                    reserve for ourselves. If you keep quiet about it, you're going to make money.”
                    So, for me or for any of us at the consulate to get to talk to the Americans,
                    this was a very touchy business because they were under very real pressure from
                    the Brazilian side not to be too candid with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>What I did was a methodology that I learned in Hungary in the communist era where
                    no one was willing to tell you too much about anything, but lots of people were
                    willing to tell you one little thing. If you talk to a hundred people and get
                    one thing from each of them, you'll have the whole picture even though none of
                    them will give you more than one piece of information. That is indeed what I
                    did. First I talked to the American top executives and then I would ask to see
                    if I could see their plant. The foreman would take me around. The foreman was
                    not as concerned about some of these things as the men up higher. They would
                    tell me some things, sometimes on the shop floor. Next I went on and asked to
                    visit the Brazilian companies and they were also willing to talk to me. They
                    very cautiously presented me their points of view, but each time I had a
                    conversation, some new fact came out that I was pinning on my map. Before it was
                    over, I visited the Japanese and the German companies too. Everybody was afraid
                    to talk to me, but they were polite enough to receive me and try to give me a
                    little bit. By the time we got through, I had most of what I needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it play out during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: The report went to USTR. They said, “Well, we've got a lot of ammunition
                    here.” The 301 says that once you define the problem, you try to negotiate it.
                    So, the next phase after documenting all these issues, was a series of
                    negotiations. On the U.S. side, there was Clayton Yeutter, who at that time was
                    the U.S. Trade Representative. On the Brazilian side, it was Paulo Tarso Flecha
                    de Lima, who was the number two man in the Foreign Ministry. He is now the
                    Brazilian ambassador to the United States. I was on the U.S. team and there were
                    many others on the Brazilian team as well.</p>
                <p>There would be talks to try to straighten this out, try to negotiate, see if we
                    could resolve these issues. It was sort of a ping-pong match. The Brazilians
                    would start out by saying, “You folks don't understand. There is really not a
                    problem here. We work things out with each company. Clayton, you are looking at
                    the big picture and you don't understand, Paulo Tarso would say. We have nothing
                    but satisfied American companies with whom we've worked out all of these things
                    in an amicable fashion.” Then Yeutter would turn to me and say, “Steve, tell
                    them about Westinghouse or the Varian Corporation.” I would spell out the
                    problem cases in detail, those cases to which the companies involved had no
                    objection to being brought up. I would put on the table some of the most
                    egregious discriminatory practices that had been brought into play. SEI was
                    represented and was absolutely astonished. People would blanch. “How did the guy
                    find all this stuff out?” There were people taking notes like crazy. They
                    couldn't believe that we had actually documented and found out all these things
                    which they had been doing under the surface and meticulously kept out of the
                    public eye until then.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Their next tactic was to accuse me of singling out as problems only the cases of
                    “bad American companies,” companies that were “bad citizens” who were not
                    willing to play the Brazilians' game. I remember at a reception one night at the
                    Brazilian Embassy in Paris, where Sebastiao do Rego Barros, who was the number
                    two man on the Brazilian team, said to me, “Tell me, Mr. Dachi, do you
                    distinguish between good companies and bad companies among your Americans in
                    Brazil?” I said, “I don't know what you mean.” He said, “Well, you know,
                    companies that cooperate and play a constructive game with us here and the ones
                    that are looking to get unfair advantages and so on. The way you were talking
                    this afternoon, you don't distinguish between good companies and bad companies.”
                    I said, “Mr. Ambassador, I have to confess to you that I've never looked at our
                    companies as good companies and bad companies. I only distinguish between
                    companies as either ours and yours.” He said, “Well, we're going to have a lot
                    of trouble then.”</p>
                <p>Clayton Yeutter was a great negotiator as well as a hell of a nice guy and he was
                    trying to be very reasonable, but he couldn't get past this point, that the
                    Brazilians refused to look at all this as a policy issue between our two
                    countries rather than a Machiavellian “rewards and punishments” game with
                    individual companies. In the end, we couldn't get much to satisfy USTR. So,
                    according to section 301, if you can't negotiate a satisfactory resolution,
                    then, by law, you move on to invoke sanctions.</p>
                <p>To invoke sanctions, hearings chaired by USTR are held in Washington. in which
                    all interested parties including the companies that would be damaged by the
                    sanctions and the companies that are complaining about discrimination against
                    them can be heard. Then a list of products for sanctions and retaliation is
                    drawn up. That series of hearings took place. By this time, things were becoming
                    very unpleasant and tense in Brazil. It was becoming apparent that even though
                    they had been willing to bet the house that this would never happen, it looked
                    like the U.S. was really serious. We were really going to invoke sanctions.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>The sanctions hearings surfaced the next set of issues. Some companies, including
                    IBM, were uncomfortable with sanctions because they had something to gain as
                    well as to lose by letting things stay as they were. But the toughest, biggest
                    issue was, how do you apply sanctions? The trade law sanctions originally were
                    based on the premise that if you don't buy computers from us in some kind of a
                    fair way, then we're not going to buy computers from you. Well, Brazil didn't
                    export computers to the United States. In fact, Brazil didn't export anything in
                    the high-tech category. So, a serious question arose, can you retaliate with
                    products that are not in the same category? This became a very tough issue to
                    resolve. For example, Brazil was exporting over $1 billion a year of frozen
                    orange juice concentrate to the U.S.. That was one of their biggest exports.
                    Were we going to place barriers to that? You couldn't do it because Coca-Cola
                    and Procter and Gamble make orange juice in this country using Brazilian
                    concentrate blended with Florida concentrate. You can bet your life that those
                    companies were all represented with their lawyers to make sure their clients
                    were not affected. That made such a step politically impossible. Every American
                    wants orange juice on their breakfast table and all of it is a blend. We
                    couldn't retaliate with orange juice.</p>
                <p>The next biggest item was $1 billion worth of shoes. But, President Reagan had
                    said earlier that we were not going to play any games with shoes because we've
                    got issues with shoes in Italy and in Spain, leather shoes, and in Asia with
                    sandals and so on. He didn't want to open up that huge issue by singling out one
                    country for sanctions, when similar arguments could be made in several other
                    cases where invoking sanctions would not have been convenient for us.</p>
                <p>That took the two biggest exports off the table. Pretty soon, a number of other
                    exports were taken off the table for similar kinds of considerations. Finally,
                    we came up with a sanctions list that made virtually no sense at all, consisting
                    of miscellaneous items that almost nobody cared about. Inevitably, they were
                    products imported by companies that were too small to hire high-priced lobbyists
                    to ward off the sanctions. The Brazilian defense was, “How is it fair to
                    retaliate against a machine tool or some other unrelated item for something that
                    you don't like about computers?” So, it became very tough. Since that time, a
                    similar dilemma has arisen on a number of other occasions when the U.S. decided
                    to impose trade sanctions against foreign countries.</p>
                <p>Brazil's attitude was, “We don't want sanctions of any kind.” Our position was,
                    “Some kind of sanctions have to be imposed.” The situation came to a head in a
                    unique way. There was one young but fast growing company involved that didn't
                    have a preexisting stake or physical presence in Brazil. That was Microsoft and
                    the now world famous Bill Gates. Gates was big enough even then, however, that
                    when he said, “No compromise” all the others who wanted to compromise were
                    stymied.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>The Microsoft situation was very interesting because it brought software into the
                    equation for the first time. Up to then, all the biggest interested parties were
                    in hardware. In those days, the leading Microsoft software was MS-DOS, which
                    today is only found in museums, I guess. Every few months, Microsoft would come
                    up with a new generation of MS-DOS. They all had a number attached to them.
                    There was 3.3, 4.1, 5.2 etc. This saga began a year or two before the sanctions
                    hearings, when the Brazilian regulatory agency (SEI) had decided that they were
                    going to sponsor, or to be more accurate to subsidize the development of a
                    “national similar” for MS-DOS software. They selected a small Brazilian software
                    company with close ties to the military, paid them to develop a Brazilian MS-DOS
                    version, (we considered it a pirated version), which they did. The deal was that
                    in exchange for coming up with this MS-DOS-like “Brazilian software” SEI would
                    keep the market closed and allow the Brazilian company to make a ton of money by
                    selling it without having to worry about the “real” Microsoft MS-DOS. So they
                    went ahead and did it. Now, all along, the controversy was, was any of this
                    pirated? They insisted that they had developed this at home in its entirety. We
                    insisted that it was pirated, at least in part.</p>
                <p>Next, another new reality of the high-tech era came to the surface. While the
                    Brazilians developed their version of MS-DOS 4.2, Microsoft was ready to go with
                    MS-DOS 5.1. Brazil could close the market and develop their ersatz stuff, but
                    they were too slow. They were coming up with software that was obsolete by the
                    time it hit the market. Bill Gates was saying, “Fine, close the market for 4.2
                    and sell all you want. Let me bring in my 5.You don't have a national similar
                    for that.” They said, “No version oMS-DOS can come in.” Bill Gates' position was
                    firm. “In that case, I will insist that USTR must apply sanctions.” The way our
                    sanctions system works, the CEO of an important U.S. company can in fact do that
                    because USTR considers that its mandate is to take action on behalf of the
                    interests of U.S. companies.</p>
                <p>I remember Bill Gates coming into my office one day. I didn't even know who he
                    was at the time. He was not the giant that he is today. He sat in my office and
                    told me, “I'm not going to go along with this. They can't do this to me.” When
                    it came time to play the game in Washington, he said, “I've got the leading
                    software technology for computers all over the world. These guys aren't going to
                    keep me out of Brazil by coming up with some pirated second-class version of it.
                    If I let them get away with it in Brazil, they are going to start doing it to me
                    all over the world. I'm number one. I'm the greatest and the biggest. I'm not
                    giving an inch.” Since he didn't have a direct investment such as a plant in
                    Brazil, he didn't have a foot in both camps like IBM, Xerox, and all the rest of
                    them, he just said, “No.” He couldn't be bought off.At this point Brazil finally
                    realized that sanctions were really going to be imposed. They decided it was
                    time to try and cut another Brazilian-style deal. They chose me as a back
                    channel. They said, “All right, if we can't do it this way, look at this
                    alternative. We know that Microsoft is going to come out with Windows software
                    soon. What if we guarantee you that all Windows systems that Microsoft makes
                    will be admitted, in exchange for you leaving us alone with our own MS-DOS? We
                    can't put this on the table. We're just giving it to you back channel as a
                    deal.” They were getting pushed to the wall.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The reason they had to try this was that the company they subsidized to develop
                    their MS-DOS was tied to the military. Had they tried to revoke their license
                    after having invested all the time, money, and energy into developing this
                    second-rate software, they would have an impossible political problem on their
                    hands. Alternately, if they allowed the real MS-DOS to come in, nobody would
                    have bought the Brazilian product and the company would have gone bankrupt. The
                    only way out that they could see was to “buy them out” with more money than the
                    company could have made by selling the software in a closed market. They had
                    done this before with private start-up companies they had subsidized that
                    subsequently went bankrupt and were bailed out with this method. I had one
                    friend in Sao Paulo who became a very wealthy man by selling off his bankrupt
                    company to the state in this manner. So, they had a precedent for trying it
                    again. When Bill Gates heard about it, he just laughed. He said, “I am making no
                    compromises. Nobody pushes me around. I don't have to make any compromises.
                    Either it's my way or it's no way.”</p>
                <p>In Brazil, there was a Supreme Council of Informatics that was a sort of board of
                    directors for SEI. It had 16 members. They were all Cabinet ministers and
                    military. This Council had been rubber stamping everything SEI had proposed
                    since its inception. But in the case of Microsoft, they found themselves for the
                    first time between a rock and a hard place. Sooner or later, it came down to the
                    fact that the only way Brazil could avoid sanctions was to back down on this,
                    have the Supreme Council overrule SEI and vote to license Bill Gates exactly the
                    way he wanted it. We launched a discreet lobbying campaign that I carried out
                    with the full support of Ambassador Harry Shlaudeman. It was one of the things
                    that I feel the best about in my career because when we got through, that
                    Council voted something like 16:6 to cave in and license Microsoft software. Of
                    course, the threat of sanctions played a large role in that as well. That was a
                    big turning point. Within two years, the Informatics Law was gone. We played
                    that really well, I thought. We were the visiting team playing in someone else's
                    field and we won. I just loved that.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me ask a couple of questions. Did you get any support as you were moving
                    on this issue from other countries (the French, Germans, British, and
                    Japanese)?</p>
                <p>DACHI: That is a very good question. They did what they always do. They said,
                    “Terrific! Go get'em [them]! We're going to watch. We're not going to get
                    involved. You are the only one that can play this kind of big power game, but
                    we're behind you 100%. We are a few steps behind, but we support you totally.
                    You're absolutely right. Do this.” In real terms, they did nothing. They gave us
                    a lot of “moral support.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That and 25 cents will get you a cup of coffee.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>DACHI: Right. But they were delighted that we were doing it. It would be
                    inconceivable to the French or the Germans to do something like this. Only
                    Americans who are used to playing the superpower game take to this
                    naturally.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, in a way, this appeals to the Americans in that there is a principle
                    involved. Often, we'll go off on a principle rather than make deals. It's in our
                    psyche. Would you say that?</p>
                <p>DACHI: It's true in general. But there is an additional, specific thing behind
                    it. We have a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prevents American companies
                    from playing the kind of game that Europeans and Japanese play with impunity all
                    the time. All of these kinds of corrupt practices and bribes that they use
                    without a moment's hesitation is something that is legally prohibited to
                    American companies and the largest majority of them don't engage in it. That
                    means that the Europeans feel they can work things out in the traditional third
                    world style, by pulling their own kinds of deals. They did it then and they're
                    doing it to this day wherever they can. That is not available to us.</p>
                <p>Let me give you a couple of other specific examples of things going on in
                    connection with informatics during my time there. General Motors was upgrading
                    the automobiles they were assembling in Brazil. More and more electronic
                    components were coming into use, from electronic windshield wipers to disk
                    brakes, sophisticated radios, cruise control and so on. GM has a subsidiary
                    called Delco Electronics that has been part of General Motors since the 1930s.
                    Delco Electronics developed the first electric starter so you no longer had to
                    use a crank to start a car. It has been developing new products and more
                    recently electronics for General Motors worldwide ever since.</p>
                <p>One fine day, the Brazilians decided that Delco Electronics would no longer be
                    allowed to supply electronic components to General Motors in Brazil. GM would
                    henceforth have to purchase those products from a Brazilian company under the
                    guise of the national similar law. The only fly in the ointment was that there
                    was no Brazilian company making such components. So, they set up a new Brazilian
                    dummy company and wanted to force Delco to sell, or to be more exact pass
                    through its electronics through them. They in turn would then sell it back to
                    General Motors as a Brazilian product. It created the absurd situation that GM
                    couldn't import technology components for their own cars from their own
                    subsidiary.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>What made the Brazilians do it? It is common knowledge by now that corruption has
                    become a highly sophisticated art form in scores of developing countries around
                    the world, and Brazil has had its share of spectacular cases to come to light.
                    Just a few years ago, President Fernando Collor de Melo was in fact impeached
                    for corruption and had to leave office, an unprecedented event. In the GM case,
                    the Brazilians set up a dummy company with the sons of three retired military
                    officers. It was a paper company. It produced nothing, had no operations. They
                    obviously offered no value added to the Delco products. All they wanted to do
                    was get this stuff from Delco and resell it to General Motors. It was laundering
                    General Motors' own proprietary technology through a fictitious company. That's
                    a blatant form of corruption, even though it was set up ingeniously to look like
                    a legitimate business in keeping with Brazilian laws. Again, this type of thing,
                    another textbook example of the infinite variety of corrupt third world
                    practices, is happening in lots of countries nowadays. I recently read a story
                    of a similar giant scale scam in the pharmaceutical field run by the Algerian
                    military. The Indonesians were pretty good at it too. It didn't surprise me that
                    General Motors wouldn't have any of it. No company in its right mind would go
                    along with that. Whether it would bother Fiat or Renault or Toyota, let me just
                    say I don't know.</p>
                <p>Westinghouse was another example. Some years earlier, they won a contract to
                    supply the high-tech equipment for a number of large energy plants in Sao Paulo
                    state. Before the informatics law came in, they had installed what are called
                    system controls, where the entire production line is regulated by a series of
                    computers, a whole integrated, portal-to-portal system that is
                    computer-controlled. When it came time to upgrade the plant, to come up with a
                    new generation of technology, Westinghouse was not allowed to bid on modernizing
                    its own high-tech system. Only Brazilian companies could bid on it. These to me
                    were outrageous kinds of things. When we started putting such cases on the table
                    in government negotiations, everybody feigned shock because these high-level
                    officials don't normally either like to admit knowledge about such things or
                    else don't like to get their hands dirty by poking their nose into such matters.
                    Unless of course they have a piece of the action. At our first round of
                    negotiations in Paris their reaction was to deny it all, but it was clear they
                    were embarrassed. Whether they knew about it or not, obviously it was painful to
                    have such shady practices brought out by a foreign delegation in a diplomatic
                    negotiation.</p>
                <p>Q: As you were going through this, did the Brazilians try to retaliate against
                    American firms. Were there problems? What about the American firms that, like
                    IBM, had been learning to live with this situation? What was happening?</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>DACHI: There was always talk of counterretaliation. When things were coming close
                    to sanctions, they were always threatening to do that. (Recently, the subject
                    came up in negotiations with the Chinese and they did retaliate. They bought a
                    number of airplanes from Airbus Industries when they promised earlier to get
                    them from Boeing. They got mad at our pressure on them in U.N. bodies on human
                    rights). However, the options for Brazil at the time were very limited. They
                    knew that in the end, if they start counterretaliating, they are going to be
                    playing our game and nobody knows how to play the big power retaliation game as
                    well as we do. They knew they would lose if they did that. What they did instead
                    as a last resort was to try to divide the American business community. By the
                    time the sanction hearings were held in Washington, they had almost won the
                    game. Every company that was invested in Brazil backed down and was trying to
                    work a compromise. At the hearings, most U.S. companies testified against
                    sanctions. The only guy that couldn't be split off was Bill Gates. He didn't
                    have anything by way of direct investment in Brazil, so in effect he had nothing
                    to lose. As we said earlier, however, the Brazilians backed off at the last
                    minute, Microsoft Dos software was licensed for import and the sanctions never
                    came to pass.</p>
                <p>They used the same strategy with the foreign debt. At the same time as all this
                    was going on, they had also declared a moratorium on the foreign debt. They
                    wouldn't (or couldn't) even pay the interest, much less the principal on their
                    nearly $100 billion foreign debt. That put the western banks, American, European
                    and Japanese into a bind all their own. But soon, another “Brazilian solution”
                    was devised which of course remained an unstated policy. Citigroup and a few
                    others had large retail commercial banking operations in the local market. The
                    Brazilians left those alone. In the hyperinflationary atmosphere of the times,
                    the foreign banks were allowed to make the same huge windfall profits as the
                    Brazilian banks. Those profits helped to compensate in part for losses from the
                    medium and long-term debt moratorium. Then there were the short-term loans for
                    commercial transactions Brazil absolutely had to have to finance essential
                    imports. Those were also left alone, even allowing the banks to greatly increase
                    their interest rates on them and thus recover a large part of the remainder of
                    their losses. The net effect was that the major U.S. banks also opposed the
                    proposed informatics sanctions because they were spared major losses from the
                    debt moratorium and allowed to continue operating freely in Brazil.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Then there was a large group of companies like Monsanto, Dow, Dupont, Eastman
                    Kodak, the auto makers and the auto parts manufacturers that weren't involved in
                    either the informatics or the debt moratorium problems. They never had any
                    trouble taking out profits from Brazil and faced no new restrictions on
                    remitting them in hard currency in spite of the moratorium. They initially made
                    their profits in Brazilian currency of course. According to the law, they could
                    take out more or less eight percent of their profits at no remittance tax, the
                    next four percent at a relatively low tax and the next four percent at a much
                    higher tax. (I'm not sure of the exact figures). They could go to the Central
                    Bank with their Brazilian currency and convert them to dollars. The American
                    banks, on the other hand, although they were receiving interest payments on the
                    debt in Brazilian currency, could not go to the Central Bank and convert it into
                    dollars. (The moratorium was on hard currency payments which all the loan
                    agreements required.)</p>
                <p>Given the volatility of the situation, it was not surprising that most of the
                    CEOs from the 400 some American companies in Sao Paulo were down there visiting
                    all the time. I was in on several dozen meetings in which these kinds of issues
                    would be discussed. As I was saying, there was a moratorium on debt payments. On
                    the other hand, Dow, Monsanto, Dupont, and the others could always take their
                    profits in Brazilian currency, convert them to dollars, and take their money
                    out. The large difference in the way American companies were treated led to a
                    significant split between them, just as the Brazilians intended. I would have
                    breakfast with the heads of Citibank, Chase and Manufacturers Hanover. Then
                    there would be the guys from the other companies. They would inevitably start
                    arguing vigorously with each other over the perceived favorable treatment one
                    group was receiving over another. Obviously, the Brazilians split off all the
                    manufacturers who were having no difficulty operating. The latter in turn were
                    hassling the banks as to why they were making such a fuss about some stupid
                    little interest on part of the debt, while keeping their other operations going
                    at higher profits, and making it more difficult for the rest of the companies to
                    work normally in Brazil. That was the Brazilian “divide and conquer” strategy.
                    For a short while, it was fairly successful.</p>
                <p>The story of the banks was revealing. Take Citibank, for example. It was the
                    biggest one. To elaborate a little more, there are several kinds of debt. There
                    is long and medium term debt. That is where the moratorium was in effect. There
                    is also short-term debt. Short-term debt is what is used to finance exports and
                    imports. In other words, if Brazil wants to import something, they have to come
                    up with dollars to pay at the point of shipment. The importers wouldn't get
                    their money back until they sold the product. Somebody had to finance that. So,
                    the banks continued financing that trade and Brazil had no choice but to pay the
                    interest on it. Otherwise, they couldn't finance their everyday import
                    necessities. So, what did banks like Citibank do? They weren't getting paid
                    interest on the medium or long term debt, but the Brazilians allowed them to
                    charge three times as much interest as the market rate on their short-term debt.
                    So, Citibank would make back what they lost on their long-term debt by charging
                    more on the short-term debt. The Brazilians used that gambit to keep Citibank
                    “playing the game and staying on the Brazilian side.”</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>There was another component. Citibank had retail banks. They had Citibank
                    branches all over Brazil. As we briefly touched on earlier, when you have 40-60%
                    inflation a month, banks make a lot of money in this kind of an inflationary
                    situation. Citibank was making a fortune along with the Brazilian banks on their
                    domestic operations. So, that was a Brazilian strategy, to play the Brazilian
                    game, make a deal with every company consisting of “get hurt here but benefit
                    there,” and so on. That is how it was working. So, even though the U.S.
                    government was ostensibly acting to defend American business interests on
                    informatics, the Brazilians were brilliantly managing their American investors
                    and trade partners to divide their loyalties and keep them from lining up into a
                    solid front with the U.S. government on the sanctions issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the moratorium, did that get settled while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Over a period of many months, Brazil's debt was restructured and the
                    moratorium on interest payments ended. One avenue that was employed was what
                    eventually came to be known as Brady bonds. On the informatics side, MS-DOS was
                    licensed shortly after I left. Not long after that, there was another election.
                    There was a new government, economic reforms and trade liberalization were
                    introduced and the informatics law gradually disappeared.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the local situation for your consulate general vis a vis the
                    Brazilian government? What were we observing and what were we doing?</p>
                <p>DACHI: In Brazil or in Sao Paulo?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stick to your dealings in your consular
                        district.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: After this trade and investment issue, which was number one, there were
                    two other big issues that were of great interest to the U.S. government and
                    which were also basically playing themselves out in the Sao Paulo consular
                    district. One of them was the nuclear issue. Both the Brazilians and the
                    Argentines were suspected of working on a nuclear bomb at that time. They
                    wouldn't sign the Treaty of Tlateloco, a regional version of the Nuclear
                    Non-Proliferation Treaty, but I should quickly add that since then, both Brazil
                    and Argentina have gotten out of this business. That is no longer an issue. At
                    that time, it was a big thing. The other problem was that Brazil had a very
                    substantial arms industry. They made fighter planes, satellites, ground to air
                    rockets, missiles, possibly nuclear weapons, and a lot of sophisticated
                    conventional weapons that they were exporting to other countries, not all of
                    which were on our list having the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. They did
                    business with Libya, Iraq, and Iran. All of this was of great concern to us. A
                    lot of that monitoring was going on through our consulate general, but obviously
                    by intelligence agencies that I didn't directly control. But it was all playing
                    there. People were very busy doing very important things.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>In a more traditional and conventional way, since well over half of Brazil's
                    gross domestic product is produced in the Sao Paulo consular district, which
                    includes Sao Paulo as well as another economically significant state, Parana, to
                    the south, we did a great deal of economic reporting. I would say we did about
                    half the economic reporting for the country and about 1/4 of the political
                    reporting. Again, a lot of the movers and shakers in the Brazilian political
                    picture were from Sao Paulo. That also held true in the agricultural area.
                    Brazil is a huge coffee producer. There is an international coffee agreement.
                    Between half and three quarters of the coffee in Brazil is grown in Sao Paulo
                    and points south. Brazil is the second largest soybean producer after the United
                    States and our biggest competitor in soybean exports to Europe. A lot of the
                    soybeans were grown in that area. So, we had a very large agricultural attache
                    operation just like they had in Rio. Both Rio and Sao Paulo had military
                    attaches which is practically unheard of in consulates general. The country
                    labor attache was stationed in Sao Paulo. The commercial office and the U.S.
                    Trade Center in Sao Paulo was also to some degree a tail that was wagging the
                    dog, because so much of the trade and business was taking place in that
                    district. So, all of these things made that place unique, not to mention maybe
                    1,200 non-immigrant visas a day issued with a tiny staff during high season.
                    That kept us pretty busy.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you deal with the governors of Sao Paulo and the municipal and state
                    governments? What was your impression of how they worked?</p>
                <p>DACHI: As far as how I dealt with them, our dealings with these official state
                    and municipal agencies were minimal. Government to government relations were
                    carried on in Brasilia. Even the governor of a state like Sao Paulo with a
                    population of 32-34 million people, bigger than all of Argentina, didn't have a
                    whole lot to do with issues that were of interest in our bilateral relationship.
                    I would say that 95% of it was a protocol relationship. There was very rarely
                    some issue to deal with on the government side.</p>
                <p>Q: In this 1985-1988 period, were there problems with urban terrorists? An
                    American military officer had been assassinated in Sao Paulo earlier on.</p>
                <p>DACHI: That had diminished very greatly by then. We were still on a relatively
                    high state of alert. I certainly had a lot of security around me. I still had a
                    fully armored vehicle and bodyguards and the residence was protected to a very
                    high degree. But by that time, people were beginning to think that that was no
                    longer essential. They started phasing it out shortly after I left. There was
                    and still is a great deal of crime, but terrorism had abated considerably. Our
                    residence, the car and everything, our procedures were still at a pretty high
                    level of terrorism alert, but there was practically no terrorism anymore in
                    Brazil by the time I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues that we should talk about
                        before wmove on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>DACHI: There is this transition business. That is actually just one story. Then
                    the other, I don't know whether you want to talk about it or not. It's also a
                    specific circumscribed case. In my first year there was when the remains of Nazi
                    war criminal Josef Mengele were found and exhumed. I had a very key role in the
                    investigation that allowed him to be identified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this go back to your dental work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That's right. That was an interesting story. Whether ibelongs in here or
                    not, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might tell it, but first why don't you talk about
                        thtransition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: There is only one story of my involvement in that. After 20 years of rule,
                    when it became apparent that they were going to let the civilians take over, the
                    military, as we said earlier, made sure that certain areas in public business
                    would remain under their control or influence. Secondly, they would only agree
                    to an indirect election of the first civilian president. The man who was sort of
                    chosen by a civilian consensus to be the man to run in this election was an old
                    traditional politician, Tancredo Neves. There was a lot of suspicion that in the
                    last minute the military would change their minds and somehow prevent Tancredo,
                    as everybody called him, to be elected. Anyway, the election was held and he
                    won. The Vice President was Jose Sarney. Tancredo Neves unfortunately died
                    before his inauguration. But the circumstances of his death were most
                    unusual.</p>
                <p>On the surface, the case seemed to be simple enough. He developed some kind of
                    tumor in the abdomen. They operated on him. Instead of getting better, however,
                    he got worse. They performed all kinds of heroic medical measures, far too late
                    to do any good, and he died anyway. What happened afterwards goes to show that
                    the United States is not the only country that loves to be absorbed by
                    conspiracy theories. The speculation about what really happened, and the
                    suspicions and tales of dark conspiracies as to why it happened spread like
                    wildfire. Our superiors in Washington also got caught up in the game of
                    “whodunit.” The temptation to suspect foul play was great, given that Tancredo
                    seemed to be in perfect health until the sudden announcement of his operation,
                    and the flood of speculation and political intrigue about his emergence as the
                    military's chosen candidate was running rampant. Everybody was asking “what
                    really happened, what are they covering up?”</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>The background to this story is enriched by an interesting coincidence. Ronald
                    Reagan and Tancredo Neves were more or less the same age, in their early 70s.
                    They both developed a tumor of the intestine in practically the same location,
                    at practically the same period of time. The tumor of Tancredo Neves turned out
                    to be benign. He was operated on and within six weeks was dead. The tumor that
                    Ronald Reagan had in the same spot was malignant. Six weeks later, he was back
                    at the White House giving a state dinner for the Prime Minister of China and was
                    fully recovered. The difference, as it turned out and as I unearthed and
                    reported, was a difference in the standards of medical care as practiced in the
                    United States and in Brazil.</p>
                <p>It turned out that poor Tancredo Neves did not die as a result of a political
                    plot or conspiracy, but became a victim of a blatant case of “miscarriage of
                    medical care.” Standard medical and surgical procedures that were common
                    knowledge practically since the beginning of this century were ignored and
                    violated. The CIA was extremely interested in finding out what exactly had
                    happened. The administration was interested in it too, because there was a risk
                    that the transition to democracy could be imperiled if Jose Sarney, who didn't
                    have the status and the prestige that Neves had, were to become president. So,
                    we were concerned, but we weren't getting much information because Tancredo's
                    doctors and the Neves family really circled the wagons and kept all information
                    about his medical status out of the public domain. As always happens in such
                    cases, that just brought rumors and public speculation to a fever pitch.
                    Tancredo got worse and worse and finally died. And, nobody knew what the hell
                    had happened. Certainly the Brazilian public didn't know.</p>
                <p>How did we find out? By the time Tancredo Neves was so sick that he obviously was
                    going to die, the family and his doctors finally called in an American
                    specialist from the Boston area. They swore him to secrecy. The man was a
                    renowned specialist in emergency care. He had looked after several chiefs of
                    state including various kings, queens as well as Leonid Brezhnev. He came and
                    examined Tancredo, talked to all the physicians involved, but by the time he got
                    through with that, Tancredo died. Even after his death, the specialist did not
                    make himself available to anybody. No one in the family or among the Brazilian
                    doctors was talking to anybody about anything either. Had any part of the truth
                    come out at that point, it would have unleashed one of the biggest scandals in
                    Brazilian history.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>I “cold called” the American doctor at his hotel. I said to him, “I just wanted
                    to say hello. I am the Consul General here. Is there anything I can do for you.”
                    He said, “I'm fine, thank you. It's all over and I'm leaving tomorrow.” I said,
                    “How about lunch?” He said, “Okay, we'll have lunch.” We sat down to have lunch.
                    I started chatting with him about my medical background and slowly, almost
                    without realizing it, he began to tell me the medical story of what had
                    happened. He had really unearthed this thing from a medical standpoint from
                    beginning to end. Well, with my background, I was able to follow what he was
                    describing, the terminology. I could tell from the beginning that this was
                    extremely exciting. I decided to tell him that, unfortunately, I had an upset
                    stomach and so every 10 minutes I had to excuse myself. Every 10 minutes, I
                    would got to the bathroom and furiously write down everything he had said up to
                    that point and then go back and talk to him some more. The end result was that I
                    got the whole story. The whole story was basically that of a bunch of doctors
                    failing to use common medical and surgical practice that had been well known and
                    accepted for at least 50 years. They committed the most atrocious medical and
                    surgical errors imaginable every step of the way. So, in that sense, they
                    literally killed the man. They couldn't have, medically speaking, done any worse
                    than they did.</p>
                <p>There was a series of things there. It actually started with Tancredo himself and
                    the fact that he was very suspicious of everybody and everything going on at the
                    time. Plus, he didn't like to go to doctors. He refused to go to specialists
                    early on because he didn't trust them. He insisted on staying with his own
                    little village hometown doctors who truly didn't know enough about modern
                    medicine. Tancredo himself made matters worse by refusing to consider the
                    possibility that he may need an operation. So his local doctors gave in to him
                    and treated his worsening abdominal pain with antibiotics, even though there
                    were growing signs that he was developing a bowel obstruction. That was a
                    horrible mistake, delaying the inevitable at the insistence of the patient,
                    until the case became a life threatening emergency. Finally the obstruction did
                    set in, and he had no choice but to go to some surgeons in Brasilia. They
                    operated on him two days later. What they found at surgery, as we learned from
                    our American specialist, was that a benign tumor of the bowel which should have
                    been removed much earlier, had grown to the point of obstructing the bowel.
                    Inevitably, an infection and an acute abdominal abscess developed, necessitating
                    the surgical intervention that was performed.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>That should have been the beginning of his recovery, but instead it turned into
                    the beginning of the end. The surgeons in Brasilia acted unconscionably. They
                    were so eager to derive maximum publicity for operating on the President-elect,
                    they called photographers into the patient's room the day after the operation so
                    they could have their pictures taken with him. They got Tancredo to sit with
                    them on the couch, which in itself is not that big of a deal the day after
                    surgery, and had their picture taken. But they made a fatal mistake. It so
                    happens that after intestinal surgery, the intestines become paralyzed and stop
                    functioning normally for a while. Without sounding too indelicate, one of the
                    things that happens is that you generate a lot of gas that has to escape some
                    way. It can't come out in the usual channel because that is temporarily stopped
                    up. For patients who have abdominal surgery it is therefore standard practice to
                    put a tube through the nose into the stomach so that one can get rid of (pass)
                    the gas. Well, Tancredo, not unlike many willful patients, wanted that tube out
                    of there so he could get his picture taken looking like nothing had happened.
                    The surgeons said, “Fine.” They took the tube out so that they would have a nice
                    photograph. But as every minimally competent surgeon knows, after all it was a
                    routine surgical fact known for decades, once the tube is taken out you can't
                    put it back in. What followed was as predictable as night follows day. Within
                    three or four days his stomach, bloated with all the trapped gas, literally
                    exploded. It blew up! The sutures opened and everything blew up. The infection
                    that was present from the original obstruction and the ensuing operation spread
                    all through the abdominal cavity, provoking a generalized systemic infection
                    known as sepsis. It was criminal to allow something like that to happen.</p>
                <p>But that was not the end of it. They compounded the error with two more crucial
                    mistakes. They sewed his stomach back up with steel wire, once again cutting off
                    all possible escape routes for the abdominal gases, and flooded the patient with
                    a mixture of all the different antibiotics they could lay their hands on in the
                    hospital pharmacy, to combat the system-wide infection that was now threatening
                    the survival of the patient. That is the exact opposite of good antibiotic
                    therapy, which calls for culturing the organisms recovered from the abscess and
                    running laboratory tests to see which specific antibiotic they are most
                    sensitive to. On the one hand, they failed to even take a culture, on the other,
                    by mixing all the antibiotics together they made it impossible to subsequently
                    test for sensitivity to any one of them. When you spend all your antibiotic
                    bullets at the same time, if an antibiotic-resistant organism develops, it
                    becomes resistant to the entire mix and you have nothing left with which to
                    treat it. The result: the infection gets out of control, spreads all over, and
                    the patient dies. That is what happened to Tancredo. (When Tancredo took a major
                    turn for the worse, he was sent down to Sao Paulo into the care of some of the
                    most prominent specialists in Brazil, but by that time it was too late).</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>I wrote this up in a cable called “The Death of a President.” I wrote it up in
                    medical terms, laicized a little bit, and sent it off. This created a sensation
                    in Washington. Tony Motley was the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin
                    America. He called me up and said that this was the only cable from a Latin
                    American embassy during his time there with which Ronald Reagan was so
                    fascinated he actually read it from beginning to end. I got a letter of
                    commendation from Director William Casey of the CIA. He said the CIA doctors had
                    read the whole thing from beginning to end and concurred with my analysis and
                    description of the medical events that led to Tancredo's death. I was sort of a
                    “folk hero” there for a while in the Agency because of this cable. So, on the
                    one hand, this information showed that there was no military or other nefarious
                    political manipulation. On the other hand, it was a dramatic story of how
                    doctors had actually killed the President-elect of Brazil out of pure ignorance,
                    at the very time when the finest medical techniques had saved Ronald Reagan from
                    a cancerous condition that was far worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might tell the story about Mengele. Who was Mengele
                        and hodid this happen in your consular district?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Josef Mengele was a doctor with the German SS. He was assigned to
                    Auschwitz. At Auschwitz, he was the man who conducted the bulk of the medical
                    experiments on the inmates and, in particular, was doing all this research on
                    twins that became so notorious subsequently. He was one of the major Nazi war
                    criminals who was not in custody at the time of the Nuremberg trials. After the
                    war, he hid in Germany for a while but then with the assistance of his family,
                    which owned a farm tool company in Germany, escaped to Argentina, where he lived
                    under an alias for quite a few years during the Peron era without much danger to
                    him. After Peron was deposed in 1955, many of the Nazi war criminals hiding in
                    Argentina began to feel less safe and Mengele for one, moved to Paraguay. He
                    acquired Paraguayan citizenship under his own name. President Alfredo Stroessner
                    the Paraguayan dictator was well-known for hiding Nazi war criminals, although
                    Argentina was the most notorious of them all. They certainly protected a huge
                    number, took their wealth, and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>In 1961, after about 18 months in Paraguay, Mengele moved to Brazil. By that
                    time, the West German government was trying to look into his possible
                    extradition. Another dangerous development for him was the fact that the chief
                    administrator of the holocaust, Adolf Eichmann, had been captured in Argentina
                    in 1960 by the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service and spirited out to
                    Israel, where he was tried, convicted and eventually executed. Mengele went to
                    Brazil in 1961 and went back undercover with a new alias, Peter Hochbichler,
                    after living openly under his own name in his last few years in Argentina and
                    subsequently in Paraguay. He was taken to a remote farm in the interior of Sao
                    Paulo state by a fellow Nazi who aided him in crossing the border, and he was
                    sheltered there by an Austro-Hungarian Nazi couple for several years. They at
                    first didn't know who he was. Later, they found out, but continued to shelter
                    him. He eventually moved on to be harbored by a German-Brazilian couple with
                    Nazi sympathies in Sao Paulo. (The wife was a teacher at the German school in
                    Sao Paulo.) Eighteen years later, in 1978, he went to the beach in Bertioga, a
                    town not far from Sao Paulo with this German couple. While he was swimming, he
                    had a stroke and as a result, he drowned. They buried him secretly under a false
                    name. Even after all that time, everybody in the world still thought that he was
                    in Paraguay. No one suspected he was in Brazil, even though his son had gone
                    there clandestinely to visit him once before he died and once again after his
                    death, to recover some of his possessions.</p>
                <p>All those years, no one, not even in the network of the many Nazi fugitives
                    hiding out in neighboring countries, really knew where he was. His family in
                    West Germany always knew and had been in regular contact with him both by mail
                    and through personal emissaries. But they had always paid off enough people in
                    the local police in G�nzburg, Germany where they lived, so that they could never
                    find or seize any evidence. Then in 1985, about the time I arrived in Brazil,
                    the last guy at the local police in G�nzburg that they had paid off died or
                    retired. At that point the German police raided the Mengele family house and,
                    for the first time caught them by surprise and found some letters and other
                    documents. Based on that evidence, they found out where he was living. They came
                    over to Brazil, staked the place out in the Sao Paulo suburb of Santo Amaro and
                    together with Brazilian police went in, seized the couple that had hidden him
                    and learned that Mengele was no longer alive. The family took them to a grave
                    where they claimed they had secretly buried him and the remains were exhumed.
                    Then the large scale operation to determine if this really was or wasn't Mengele
                    began.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>The U.S. had just signed an agreement with Germany and Israel that we would
                    henceforth cooperate more closely on Nazi hunting operations. But the Germans
                    were so eager to nail Mengele and get the sole credit for it that they actually
                    came over and together with the Brazilian police staked out the house and
                    exhumed his body without telling us. Of course, we didn't like that, to put it
                    mildly. In any case, the Brazilians didn't buy into the proposition that all
                    this was to be done in secret, and we found out about it when they invited a TV
                    crew to the exhumation, which was then covered in macabre detail on national
                    television. Within hours, a large group of people including hordes of
                    journalists, were on the way down from the United States. The Justice Department
                    sent a team of forensic specialists, including fingerprint and handwriting
                    experts. A group of U.S. Marshals was on the way. The Simon Wiesenthal Center in
                    Los Angeles was sending its own set of independent specialists. This was serious
                    business.</p>
                <p>As I was learning in a stream of phone calls about all these people who were
                    coming down from Washington on the next plane, I happened to see Brazil's
                    Minister of Justice holding a televised press conference stating that none of
                    the American specialists would be given a visa, because Brazilians were
                    perfectly qualified to perform all the necessary investigations and forensic
                    tests and no foreigners would be allowed to horn in on that process. Within
                    minutes, I got another call from Washington, where people already knew of the
                    Minister's statement. They instructed me to do whatever was necessary to make
                    sure that when that plane arrived early the next morning, everybody on it would
                    be issued a visa on landing and be allowed to enter Brazil, a step Brazilian
                    authorities had without exception refused to take in the past.</p>
                <p>I requested and was granted an immediate appointment with Romeo Tuma, the Sao
                    Paulo head of the Brazilian Federal Police, the legal controlling authority for
                    decisions on visa issuance. On my way to his office, I thanked my lucky stars
                    that I had made a courtesy call on Tuma shortly after my arrival in Sao Paulo
                    just four or five weeks earlier, so at least we were acquainted.</p>
                <p>When I sat down in Tuma's office, he of course was also aware of the statement
                    the Justice Minister, his boss, had made a couple of hours before. I decided to
                    try a personal approach. I told him of my childhood in Eastern Europe, of having
                    lived through World War II, of having witnessed the holocaust. I mentioned the
                    fact that six million people had perished in the holocaust and that Joseph
                    Mengele had been one of the most infamous of the Nazi war criminals, in charge
                    of sending people to the gas chambers and performing the cruelest of human
                    medical experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Then I came to the point. I said there were still thousands of holocaust victims
                    and survivors living all over the world, many of whom had been personally
                    tortured by Mengele. I said, “Mr. Tuma, those people are still suffering today.
                    Maybe their wounds have closed, but they have not healed. There is nothing more
                    important to them than to find out what happened to Joseph Mengele. And those
                    people, Mr. Tuma, have the right to be present, to be a witness to this
                    investigation. The people coming down on that plane are coming to represent
                    them. Please do not keep them out.” The results of that little speech were
                    stunning. Tuma, who had listened to me intently, said O.K. without a second's
                    hesitation. The next morning, everybody was admitted to Brazil without a
                    hitch.</p>
                <p>By the next afternoon, the U.S. team of forensic experts was in place, ready to
                    go to work. The Brazilians as well as the Germans put together their own teams.
                    The Israelis, who have always kept their distance from cases like this and
                    choose not to get directly involved, just sent an observer.</p>
                <p>My instructions were to follow this case for the U.S. government because, better
                    late than never, we wanted to know exactly what was going on and we wanted to
                    make certain that we knew for sure whether this really was Mengele or not.
                    Nowadays, you can identify people by DNA. That was not yet the case back in
                    1985. You only had fingerprints and dental records. Of course, there were no
                    fingerprints. The exhumation only yielded a skeleton. If you have dental x-rays
                    taken of someone before he died and you are certain of his identity, you can
                    take x-rays of the skull and match up the teeth very accurately. So, a bunch of
                    people went to work on this. I was just an observer at that point. I was sitting
                    in on all these sessions.</p>
                <p>After about a week, the various forensic specialists started comparing and
                    discussing their findings, using slides to project their data on the wall, and
                    so on. The Germans were the most methodical. They projected a chart of the skull
                    on the wall. On that slide, they had over 40 numbers or labels attached to each
                    anatomical angle, curvature, and point on the skull. Through a technique called
                    craniometry, you can match that up with photographs of the person you are trying
                    to identify and measure those same features. Then you overlap them and if they
                    match, you can make a pretty good identification. Well, they put this thing up
                    on the wall. They had everything on that skull numbered for every single
                    anatomical feature of the skull. There was only one thing on that skull that
                    didn't have a number next to it. That was a hole in the left cheekbone which was
                    clearly not an anatomical feature. It was a hole that to me at least, was
                    obviously caused by a pathological process. With all the experts and scientists
                    who were sitting there looking at it, not one of them had noticed it.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I took a look and said, “What the hell is that hole doing there?” They said,
                    “What hole?” I said, “See that hole over there? You don't have a number by that
                    one and that's not an anatomical hole.” They said, “Really? What do you know
                    about it?” I said, “Well, in my younger days I not only was a dentist, but I
                    happen to have specialized in oral pathology and was a diplomate of the American
                    Board of Pathology. Come and take a look at this skull.” We took a closer look
                    at the skull and, sure enough, it became apparent to everyone that this was most
                    likely to be a pathological hole, not an anatomical feature. I am skipping over
                    a lot of details. After several days of discussing and weighing the options they
                    asked me to do the pathology work together with a Brazilian specialist and try
                    to establish that this hole really was a pathological abnormality and not an
                    anatomical feature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say it was pathological, what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It's from some kind of disease process that destroyed part of the bone
                    rather than an anatomical feature. So, together with the Brazilian pathologist,
                    we prepared some slides from the bone tissue and performed a microscopic
                    examination. We established that there had been a long-term infection in the
                    maxillary sinus of Mengele's upper jaw. From questioning the people who had
                    harbored him, we knew that while he was hiding out in Brazil for years he would
                    get big dental abscesses and infections with swelling in his face and that some
                    years later he had had a root canal done. During his first few years in Brazil
                    he had been afraid to go to the dentist because he was afraid of being
                    discovered. So, since he was a physician, he would lance the abscesses with a
                    razor blade and drain the abscess himself. I am trying to keep this thing
                    relatively palatable for you in language. So, basically he had an infected tooth
                    for several years before he had a root canal done, and because this infection
                    was not treated properly for so long, it worked its way into the sinus and
                    eventually leaked or drained out to the face through the perforation or hole in
                    the part of the cheekbone covering the maxillary sinus. By the way, there was a
                    scar on the face that matched the hole in the skull that they didn't notice
                    either. I said, “Hey, this is where the tract that the infection was draining
                    through chronically over the years broke through the skin.”</p>
                <p>Once we established by microscopic examination that the hole in the skull was
                    connected to the infected maxillary sinus, the officials in the Office of
                    Special Investigations (of Nazi war criminals) at the Department of Justice had
                    me come up to the Smithsonian to make a presentation of the evidence. They
                    invited back all the forensic scientists who had participated in the original
                    investigation and I presented the findings, speaking as a fellow pathologist. I
                    showed them the results of the study and explained the whole thing. The findings
                    were accepted as valid by all the specialists.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Then came the end game. The people from the Department of Justice said to me,
                    “Look, in the meantime, we have studied Mengele's diaries that were found in the
                    house in Santo Amaro. They have been authenticated by handwriting specialists
                    who have confirmed that they were written in Mengele's hand. In the diary,
                    Mengele made several notations about going to a dentist to have a root canal
                    done. Obviously, there must be some dental x-rays from that root canal somewhere
                    in Brazil. Would you be able to find them?” We all knew that if we could find
                    the dental x-rays, we could do the standard, legally valid forensic comparison
                    and definitive identification. I agreed to try.</p>
                <p>When I returned to Sao Paulo, the first thing I did was to go to the Brazilian
                    Federal Police. The diary was written in a crude, informal code, so it wasn't
                    totally clear to any of us who that dentist might be. But I gave the information
                    to the Brazilian police. They came back within two or three weeks and said, “We
                    can't find him.” Then the Justice Department, asked me if I would look into it
                    further on my own since the Brazilian Federal Police wasn't able or willing to
                    do it. I then undertook a detailed investigation. I broke the code of the diary.
                    With that and with various other bits of information, eventually I found the two
                    dentists who had treated him, one the specialist who had done the root canal and
                    the other the general practitioner who had made the referral. Then I found the
                    x-rays in the files of the general dentist. With these x-rays in hand, the
                    forensic dentist from New York who was a member of the original team returned to
                    Sao Paulo and the final identification was done.</p>
                <p>This created an international problem that perhaps would be of interest to talk
                    about here. But just to finish the dental part, there were a number of people
                    who could not accept this evidence, even though medically it was beyond any
                    argument. Five years or so later, the DNA tests which had come into use by then,
                    were done and authenticated the findings. They validated what I had done. At
                    that point, the German government finally accepted the identification. (The
                    Department of Justice had accepted the finding immediately upon completion of my
                    investigation in 1986.) The government of Israel has not said anything publicly
                    one way or the other to this day. I should add, however, that the chief coroner
                    of the Mossad came over to Sao Paulo in late 1986 and went over my work with a
                    fine tooth comb. Afterwards, he came to my office and told me outright that
                    based on his own review he was convinced that everything I had done had been
                    absolutely correct, and there was no question in his mind about the validity of
                    the identification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, there you were back in the dental business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: The first four months that I'm in Brazil, I'm doing the death of the
                    President. Then I did Josef Mengele. Then I started on the informatics case.
                    This was a pretty spectacular four month period.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little bit about social life in Brazil as
                        thConsul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It was extremely busy. There was a huge American business community there.
                    Brazilians, the ones we met, were basically very pro-American, particularly the
                    older generation. Don't forget, Brazil was an ally of ours in World War II. They
                    had an expeditionary force and fought along with General Mark Clark in Italy.
                    Many of the younger people we had contact with, particularly in the business
                    community, had gone to college in the U.S. So, we were very, very busy. We would
                    average maybe one evening a month at home by ourselves.</p>
                <p>Our principal base of contacts was with Brazilians of course. One of our most
                    extraordinary experiences in Sao Paulo came from getting to know many of the
                    prominent entrepreneurs, the “makers of modern Brazil” as they were popularly
                    known, who had transformed the country from an agricultural economy relying on
                    commodities like coffee and sugar to a modern industrial state. Brazil today has
                    internationally competitive steel, aluminum, shoe, auto parts, electronics, and
                    armaments industries, not to mention new agricultural commodities it has
                    developed like oranges and soybeans where they are among the world's leading
                    exporters. Many of these enterprises worth hundreds of millions of dollars each,
                    were still headed in the 1980s by either their founders or the founders' sons.
                    Very few of them had yet gone public.</p>
                <p>It was a powerfully enlightening learning experience to meet these people and get
                    to know them, the Fords, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts of Brazil, and get to
                    appreciate the unique and remarkable personal traits of individuals who, almost
                    single-handedly, were able to create giant, vastly successful industries and
                    enterprises.</p>
                <p>Then there was a large American community of about 20,000. There was a lot of
                    contact with them. One small group was particularly fascinating. Slavery wasn't
                    abolished in Brazil until 1888. In the U.S., it was abolished 20 plus years
                    earlier. After the end of the Civil War, a number of southern farmers who didn't
                    think they could survive the abolition of slavery and stay in business in the
                    United States decided to move to Brazil to start new farms, both in the Amazon
                    region and in some communities in Sao Paulo state. They have been there ever
                    since. Of course they intermarried extensively, but their descendants still live
                    there in various places, including in a town called “Americana.” They have an
                    entire American community structure there, and something truly unique, a
                    confederate cemetery.</p>
                <p>I went to visit them a couple of times. The thing that I most remember is that
                    when I visited Americana sometime around July 4th one year, I went up on the
                    platform to participate in a ceremony. To my utter amazement they had the
                    confederate flag flying and they played “Dixie.” Once in a while, I would be at
                    a ceremony in Sao Paulo where when I showed up, they played the national anthem.
                    On July 4 when we had our receptions, we played the national anthem. To think
                    that there was any place left on earth (outside the United States) where they
                    played Dixie on July 4th kind of boggles the mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1988. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: After 1988, I spent three years in Washington doing a lot of different
                    things. First, after a few months of job hunting, I ended up as Deputy Permanent
                    Representative in the U.S. mission to the OAS in the spring of 1989. That was
                    certainly the briefest assignment of my career. It lasted about six weeks and
                    then the whole thing went crashing down in flames around the Panama issue and
                    General Noriega. That is a separate chapter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the job come about and what were the issues and
                        youexperiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: As far as issues were concerned, there was only one issue at the time that
                    involved me and that was the Panama issue. How did the job come about? That was
                    at the beginning of the Bush administration. Bernard Aronson had just come in as
                    the new Assistant Secretary of State chosen by Secretary of State James Baker.
                    Luigi Einaudi was the nominee to be the U.S. Permanent Representative, in other
                    words the U.S. Ambassador to the OAS. I knew Luigi from our years together in
                    different activities in Latin America. He wanted me to be his Deputy Chief of
                    Mission (DCM). Once I knew that that was the situation, I did a little bit of
                    the customary lobbying to try to help my cause. One of the people who
                    recommended me was a good friend, General Vernon Walters, who was over the years
                    intimately tied to Brazilian affairs where I got to know him. Later he had been
                    deputy director of the CIA when George Bush was CIA director. That is how I came
                    into the job, with recommendations from General Walters and Luigi Einaudi,
                    partly on the grounds that I knew Noriega from my past encounters with him in
                    Panama and Brazil. Then Bernie Aronson made the decision to approve it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the DCM do in our mission there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It is a very small mission, but basically the ambassador and the DCM are
                    the permanent representative of the U.S. and the deputy permanent representative
                    of the U.S. to the Organization of American States. So, although the DCM has to
                    run the mission internally on behalf of the Ambassador and that would have been
                    part of my job, that was a small part of it. Mostly, it was the outside work at

                <p>DACHI: They not only have OAS General Assembly meetings once a year, but they
                    have subcommissions of various kinds. There is a whole diplomatic corps of Latin
                    American and Caribbean envoys accredited to the OAS just like we (the U.S.
                    Mission) were accredited to the OAS. The U.S. Mission has offices in the State
                    Department because it is only about four blocks away from the OAS headquarters,
                    but it's an embassy like any other of our missions to international
                    organizations. It just happens that this one is in Washington. So, we were
                    dealing with the other members of the diplomatic corps, and with the issues that
                    were before the OAS, at the time, first and foremost Panama.</p>
                <p>The OAS is perhaps not the most highly regarded of international organizations,
                    if indeed there are any highly regarded international organizations nowadays. It
                    has been somewhat controversial over the years because Latin Americans have
                    always regarded it as one place where they might be able to assert themselves
                    collectively against the dominant role that the U.S. normally played when it
                    acted bilaterally without consulting anybody. On occasion at the OAS, they
                    thought they might be able to confront the U.S. collectively and win a few. But
                    on the whole, it had been pretty unanimously thought to be ineffective. As far
                    as the Latin Americans were concerned, that was because the U.S. always chose to
                    pursue its interests bilaterally and not pay that much attention to collective
                    action. Nevertheless, the U.S. was successful years earlier in persuading the
                    OAS to expel Cuba, for example. So, whatever mischief Cuba might have caused in
                    the eyes of the U.S. was certainly eliminated in the OAS. But more often than
                    not, the OAS was not a player in anything of real substance.</p>
                <p>Q: We're talking about 1989 now, but the Panama Canal Treaty had been pushed
                    through in the late 1970s. The Nicaragua-El Salvador business was coming to an
                    end at that point, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>DACHI: No, the Nicaragua-El Salvador mess was still around at the time. The
                    Panama affair came to a head before those two things did. Basically, the
                    situation when I arrived there was this: after the Panama Canal treaties were
                    ratified, the price that we thought we had exacted from General Torrijos was
                    that there would be a transition to democracy. What in fact happened over the
                    next few years after the ratification of the treaty in 1978 was that there was
                    indeed a transition to a civilian rule of sorts, but the civilians were very
                    much under the control of Torrijos and the Panamanian National Guard. So, it was
                    not a true democracy. Then, General Torrijos was killed in an airplane accident.
                    He was succeeded as Commander of the National Guard by Colonel Noriega, who
                    became a general the moment Torrijos expired. There were a couple of elections
                    held, as I recall, between 1978 and 1989, but none of them were free of
                    decisive, behind the scenes control by the National Guard.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Early in 1989, there was another election held in Panama. This time, it was
                    really supposed to be democratic, with international observers, etc. The issue
                    that the National Guard always had to face was, were they going to allow a
                    democratic election to take place and support whoever won, or were they going to
                    contrive to continue having a civilian president that they could control, one
                    who they would select and “arrange” to get elected. In this particular election
                    the winner was a man called Guillermo Endara. Endara was of the same party as
                    former president Arnulfo Arias, whom we have mentioned earlier and who had been
                    elected five times and overthrown by the National Guard each time. Endara had
                    been the Arias party's General Secretary. He was Arnulfo's man. This was the
                    worst possible outcome as far as Noriega was concerned.</p>
                <p>Back in the 1970s, Arnulfo Arias was living in exile in Miami, after he had been
                    overthrown by Torrijos in 1968. Eventually he found a soul mate in Ronald Reagan
                    who was not yet president, and formed a political compact with him to oppose the
                    Panama Canal Treaty on the grounds that we should insist that there be a
                    transition to democracy before we “give” the Panamanians the treaty, thus
                    forcing the military to proceed first with a return to democratic elections. In
                    1989, eleven years after the treaties were signed and ratified, Noriega finally
                    allowed a democratic election to go ahead, but afterwards he just couldn't get
                    himself to accept the results. He did not reckon with one big problem, however.
                    This time there were a large number of international observers present,
                    including Jimmy Carter. So manipulating the results would be trickier than
                    usual. The election itself was held and run very cleanly, and Endara won by
                    everyone's agreement. Noriega then got desperate and decided to fix the election
                    after the fact in the most crude and vulgar manner. It wasn't a matter of
                    changing 5 or 10 percent of the votes. He really had to carry out massive fraud
                    ex post facto by stealing and destroying thousands of valid ballots and stuffing
                    the ballot boxes. But he couldn't get away with it with all those observers
                    present. This created a major crisis. Finally, an angered Noriega simply said,
                    “The election is over. We win. You guys lose.”</p>
                <p>When these new “results” were announced, the real winners began to organize
                    demonstrations with thousands of people in the streets. Noriega called out his
                    thugs and brutally repressed them. There were countless flagrant human rights
                    violations and attacks against the winning candidates themselves, as well as
                    their supporters. It was really brutal, bloody, and ugly. Endara's Vice
                    President was a man called Guillermo (Billy) Ford. Noriega's brutality burst
                    onto the world state when Ford was beaten to a pulp out in the street by a
                    Noriega-inspired political mob and his blood-stained visage made the cover of
                    Time. The whole world learned about it. It was one of the most disgraceful
                    scenes possible. This, of course, upset the United States a great deal, as it
                    should have. One of the people who was most upset by it, was our ambassador,
                    Arthur Davis. He went after Noriega very hard. Eventually, Noriega complained
                    about it so much to the State Department that Davis was recalled for
                    consultations to Washington, essentially withdrawn. He was sitting in Washington
                    in the Department of State at the time I came in as DCM. That was the scene.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Our goal at the particular moment when I got started there was to make one final
                    attempt at finding a way to get Noriega, in spite of all the horrible things he
                    had done in the previous months, to turn over power to the legitimately elected
                    government. Virtually everyone agreed that the only way this could be done was
                    that Noriega had to leave Panama. But the problem with Noriega leaving Panama
                    was very complicated, because in 1987 or thereabouts he had been indicted on
                    narcotics charges by a grand jury in Miami.</p>
                <p>The story of that indictment, makes a very fascinating story. What it came down
                    to was that Noriega said, “I can't leave Panama and go into exile because if I
                    do, the U.S. government will snatch me from wherever I end up and take me to the
                    U.S. to be tried. There are no assurances or guarantees that I will accept,
                    because I know that as soon as I leave here I am going to be captured and taken
                    to the U.S. for trial.” For a good period of time, the question was, is there a
                    way to get this indictment dropped so that Noriega could be persuaded to leave
                    Panama? Whether that indictment should be dropped or not was a White House
                    decision that most people at the time believed was one of the very few times
                    when President Reagan and his Vice President, George Bush, were on opposite
                    sides of an issue. Everybody knew where Ronald Reagan stood. Yet in the end, he
                    allowed himself to be persuaded that, in exchange for getting him out of Panama,
                    (we are going back a few months in time in our story), maybe the indictment
                    could be dropped after all. But George Bush wouldn't hear of it. This was
                    perhaps the only time when the Vice President actually prevailed over the
                    President.</p>
                <p>The reason in the view of many analysts dated back to the time when George Bush
                    was head of the CIA, and Noriega was the head of Panamanian intelligence.
                    Noriega had come to Washington on one occasion when he met with the CIA director
                    and Bush had invited him to lunch. It was a known fact that Noriega always was a
                    double agent working with the Cubans just as much as he was working with us. He
                    was also in cahoots with the Medellin mafia on narcotics trafficking, as much as
                    he was working with our Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) on narcotics control. In
                    essence, he had always maintained a working relationship with the CIA and the
                    DEA, whatever other nefarious activities he was engaged in at the same time with
                    the Cubans and the Colombians.</p>
                <p>During the run-up to the 1988 U.S. presidential campaign, Michael Dukakis was
                    making noises about George Bush and Noriega having been “chummy” in their
                    intelligence days. Because of that, Bush felt that if the indictment was
                    dropped, he effectively couldn't handle the issue in public debate and run for
                    President successfully. He felt he would be too vulnerable. So, from his
                    standpoint, there were very straightforward and understandable reasons why that
                    indictment could not possibly be dropped. He persuaded Ronald Reagan on that
                    point. In the final analysis, Noriega was not willing to leave Panama, because
                    under the circumstances no assurances we might give were credible to him.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Back to the question of how did I come to this job? I have already mentioned two
                    of the reasons, but there was a third which was equally important. That third
                    reason was that I knew Noriega fairly well. I had a bit of a relationship with
                    Noriega. It goes back to two important events in the past, maybe three. When I
                    was public affairs officer in Panama, Colonel Noriega was still head of
                    Panamanian intelligence. When Jimmy Carter came to Panama in 1978 on an official
                    visit for the exchange of the Instruments of Ratification of the Panama Canal
                    Treaties, Noriega was in charge of all local arrangements for the Panamanian
                    side. I was responsible for many of the local arrangements for our side, as the
                    head of USIS always does given the huge press contingent that travels with the
                    President. I also ended up being one of the liaisons and interpreters for the
                    U.S. Secret Service in dealing with Noriega on security issues which were, as
                    usual, legion. So, Noriega and I ended up working together on a daily basis. As
                    far as he was concerned, he saw me as somehow tied to the U.S. Secret Service.
                    We were talking about security, even though I was only acting as a liaison and
                    interpreter.</p>
                <p>We also met from time to time under another set of circumstances. Many of these
                    dictators link up with some kind of a humanitarian or artistic activity to make
                    it look as if they are cultured, polished individuals. In Noriega's case, he
                    chose the Panamanian National Ballet Company. That was his pet charity. It
                    happened that, as head of USIS, I was trying to be helpful to the Panamanian
                    National Ballet as well. I was able to arrange at one point to get an American
                    guest choreographer to spend an entire year there at no expense to the
                    Panamanians. Noriega thought this was wonderful and he thought that I was
                    helping the ballet to soften my image as an intelligence type under USIS cover,
                    just like he was using it to soften his own image as a security thug. The people
                    at the Panamanian National Ballet loved me, so Noriega liked me too, thinking
                    perhaps that I was “his kind of guy.”</p>
                <p>Now we jump ahead to 1987. I am Consul General in Sao Paulo. Out of all the
                    million things that were going on there, one day it turned out there was going
                    to be a hemisphere-wide DEA and Brazilian government sponsored conference on
                    narcotics control. The two chief hosts would be Jack Long, who at the time was
                    the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and Romeo Tuma, the head of the
                    Brazilian Federal Police. (Romeo Tuma and I had worked together on the Mengele
                    case.) Every Latin American country sent representatives who were upper middle
                    level bureaucrats, but not Panama. Noriega showed up as the head of the
                    Panamanian delegation. By this time Torrijos was dead and Noriega was his
                    successor as the commander of the Panamanian National Guard, the country's only
                    armed force. Panama did ostensibly have a civilian president, but Noriega was
                    the de facto chief of state. None of the rest of the participants at the
                    conference were political figures.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>On the afternoon before the conference, I was sitting in the hotel lobby waiting
                    for my ambassador, Harry Shlaudeman. Suddenly, the Panamanian consul in Sao
                    Paulo comes running up to me saying, “We've got a terrible problem. Noriega has
                    just shown up and he insists that he is entitled to the presidential suite, and
                    they won't give it to him. They said they're saving it for the Americans. He is
                    outraged and has threatened to leave. What can you do to help?” I knew the
                    manager of the hotel. Since none of our visitors were interested in the
                    presidential suite in any case, I talked to him and he gave Noriega the suite.
                    Noriega thought, “Hey, I remember this guy, I always thought he was either one
                    of their security or intelligence people, this just goes to show you. Look how
                    quickly he got me a suite.”</p>
                <p>The next morning, there was a preparatory meeting. There we were, Jack Long,
                    Harry Shlaudeman, Romeo Tuma and I, talking at breakfast. A Tuma aide comes over
                    and tells him they've got a problem with Noriega, that Noriega insists on
                    sitting at the head table at the opening session. Tuma says, “He's not sitting
                    at the head table. All the heads of delegation are sitting down in the first two
                    rows”. The aide said, “Noriega is adamant that he is not just a head of
                    delegation, but a head of state.” Tuma turns to me and says, “Do you know
                    anything about this guy?” I said, “I know a lot about this guy. He is the chief
                    of the National Guard in Panama and the de facto head of state. He is the chief
                    of the Panamanian Armed Forces.” Tuma burst out laughing and said, “What does he
                    have, 500 people?” He was not impressed. I explained to him about Noriega's
                    vanity. He said, “All right, for you, I'll put him at the head table.” So,
                    Noriega once again got what he wanted.</p>
                <p>Then, we had a dinner in the evening. Again, Noriega has to be at the head table.
                    This time, Harry Shlaudeman said, “All right, we'll put him at the head table,
                    but you keep him occupied and talk to him the whole evening because we sure as
                    hell don't want to talk to him.” We had the dinner. I talked to Noriega the
                    entire evening. No one else at the head table would even say, “Boo” to him.
                    After the conference was over, Noriega got everything he wanted by way of perks
                    and he thought I was the one who got them for him. He never evinced much
                    interest in the substance of the meetings.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>We jump back to 1989 in our story. General Vernon Walters was one of a number of
                    people who were uncomfortable with the U.S. position of not dropping Noriega's
                    indictment. As a former deputy director of the CIA, just like some people in the
                    Pentagon who had been at SOUTHCOM, the U.S. Forces Southern Command, he was not
                    eager to see Noriega brought to the U.S. and put on trial for anything. They all
                    had dealings with him about our military presence in Panama, the defense of the
                    Canal, narcotics and Cuban intelligence activities. They were all worried about
                    what he may reveal in court about his relationship with other U.S. agencies.
                    Walters knew me well from Brazil and I told him I was looking for an assignment
                    at State, and was interested in the job at our OAS mission. He said he would be
                    pleased to recommend me. So, he went and told Bernie Aronson, “Dachi knows
                    Noriega and has dealt with him. You ought to put him in the OAS mission. It
                    would be good to have a guy there who knows Noriega. Somehow we've got to get
                    this guy to leave the country.” What Walters was really hoping was that I would
                    be more sympathetic to the views of the CIA and Defense Department on this whole
                    matter than were most of the people at the State Department. So, that also had
                    something to do with how I got the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were put in there to ease our nemesis out of the
                        picture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Well, that was sort of the general idea. About the second day on the job,
                    Aronson said to me, “I want you to make a secret trip to Panama and find out
                    what the real story is. Davis is up here. As far as I'm concerned, he is not
                    going back to Panama. We have cut off diplomatic contact. The well has been
                    poisoned. I want you to go down there and talk to your friend Noriega. This guy
                    is a pariah. We want him to leave the country, to turn over power. I want you to
                    give me an assessment of what the hell is going on, see what we could do, how we
                    might entice him to leave.”</p>
                <p>One evening during this same brief time span, I ran into the Panamanian
                    ambassador to the OAS at a reception. At this point, bilateral diplomatic
                    contacts through our respective embassies were suspended. I thought that it
                    would not be improper to talk to this man, however, because the OAS is an
                    international organization. It's not a bilateral forum. If they wanted to say
                    something significant to us, an international forum may have been the only way
                    they could do it. Such a channel is used frequently when two countries are at
                    loggerheads and have cut off their bilateral embassy contacts. In hindsight it
                    turned out to be a mistake, but at some point in our conversation I mentioned to
                    him that I knew Noriega and I might be making a trip down to Panama soon.</p>
                <p>Within a few days, this guy calls me up and says, “How about coffee? We need to
                    talk.” I went and told our ambassador-designate Luigi Einaudi, my direct boss.
                    We asked ourselves, “Is this a legitimate thing? Can we do this?” We both
                    concluded that given the international nature of the OAS it would be okay to go
                    ahead. He said, “All right, go ahead and talk to him.”</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>I met with the Panamanian “secretly” at the J.W. Marriott and we had coffee. He
                    said, “I reported to Noriega that you're in this job. He was happy to know that.
                    He thinks that's great. And, I have a message for you. The message is, anytime
                    you want to go and see him, he will see you immediately.” At that point, Noriega
                    wasn't talking to anybody on our side. Here he sent his OAS ambassador to tell
                    me that he will see me immediately if I want to go down. So, I said, “Okay,
                    thanks for telling me.” He said, “We know you. We know your background. We know
                    that, with you, we can work something out.” I said, “Don't be so sure that we
                    can work something out beyond what we have already stated publicly. This is a
                    pretty important issue for President Bush. I'll tell you exactly why. There are
                    lots of foreign policy issues that are not too important in the court of
                    American public opinion, but when it comes to drugs, that is something of vital
                    interest to every family in the United States. So, the President of the United
                    States doesn't have quite the same flexibility when it comes to drugs that he
                    does on other issues. You and the General have to understand that with something
                    like this, it's not likely that anything can be worked out without him leaving
                    the country. I really don't know.” He said, “There was another thing he wanted
                    me to ask you. Who is your boss? Who do you really work for?” I said, “I work
                    for Bernie Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
                    Affairs.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they thinking that you might be the CIA outside man
                        osomething like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes. I thought to myself, this man was fishing to see whether I would say
                    that I was really “planted” in the State Department by either the CIA, DEA or
                    Defense Department, as a way to “soften up” the hard line State was taking on
                    this issue. I am sure that was Noriega's wishful thinking. Noriega wanted to
                    believe that the CIA or the Defense Department, would be more conciliatory. But
                    the bottom line as far as he was concerned was that there had to be some way
                    that we could work this out so that he didn't have to leave Panama. I said, “I
                    don't think that's going to be possible. There is nothing I would love to do
                    more than have a role in making it possible for the U.S. and Panama to return to
                    their traditional good relationship. I am very excited that that opportunity may
                    come about someday. But I don't think when it comes to narcotics and the
                    question of Noriega leaving Panama, there is a whole lot of play in that issue.
                    It's too important for us domestically.” So, that was the end of that.</p>
                <p>I reported the conversation to Luigi. But there was nothing further to be done
                    about it at that point by either of us. About a year later, a record of that
                    conversation came to light in a most unusual way. After our armed intervention
                    in Panama, we seized many of their documents and the Panamanian ambassador's
                    report on that meeting was among them. We had the Panamanian version, which did
                    not differ in any significant way from the text of my report. But in the event,
                    Senator Jesse Helms, Ambassador Arthur Davis, Bernie Aronson and others, had a
                    much more sinister version of what they imagined had transpired in that
                    conversation, as I shall explain in a moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Far from turning out to be a forward step, that meeting soon began to unravel
                    things for me. This thing got extremely complicated. First though, let me go
                    back to the OAS. At this point our position at the OAS was that we wanted it to
                    play a role in persuading Noriega to leave Panama and turn power over to the
                    legally elected people. That is what we were spending a good bit of our time on
                    at the OAS with the other delegations. Much to our chagrin, Latin governments
                    were most reluctant to get involved. They said, “This is your problem, you
                    created this monster. You take care of it.”</p>
                <p>I certainly said it to many of them, but plenty of others did, too, “Wait a
                    minute, for years you have been accusing us of acting unilaterally in Latin
                    American relations. Here we have a clear cut case of a democratic election
                    attended by hemispheric observers in which everyone agrees that the election was
                    stolen. We have unequivocal, undisputed evidence about violent and brutal human
                    rights violations. We have powerful evidence on narcotics trafficking. If you
                    can't get involved in this issue in which we're on the side of the angels,
                    democracy and human rights, not to mention narcotics, then what good are you?
                    When is the OAS ever going to do anything useful in cooperation with us? You've
                    been telling us for 20 years not to act unilaterally. Okay, let's act
                    multilaterally. Here is the perfect issue.” They would say, “No, this is not the
                    perfect issue. Noriega is a monster that you created. We can't get ourselves
                    involved.” I would retort, “You surely must know that this is so important to us
                    and to the President that we're going to have to solve this problem one way or
                    another, multilaterally, unilaterally, or whatever, but it will have to be
                    solved. If you refuse to get involved and we have to act unilaterally, we had
                    better not hear a peep out of you. Here is your chance to work with us on
                    democracy and human rights about which there can be no debate.”</p>
                <p>Finally, they did agree to an important thing: to name the Foreign Minister of
                    Ecuador, Diego Cordovez, who had been a successful negotiator for the UN in
                    Africa, in Ethiopia and I think in Afghanistan, to spearhead an OAS effort to
                    approach Noriega about turning power over to Endara and leaving Panama. In other
                    words, the OAS was going to attempt an initiative of its own, independently of
                    the U.S., and see if Cordovez could come up with an OAS solution, but without
                    ever associating with the Americans in any way. The Ecuadorean Foreign Minister
                    accepted this job, but he was very uncomfortable with it. He was convinced deep
                    down in his bones that if he tried to work out a Latin American deal and it
                    began to look as if he would succeed, the U.S. would find some back channel to
                    work out its own deal and beat him to the punch, taking credit for it and making
                    him look silly. So, although he agreed to try to do something, he had extreme
                    reservations about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Noriega, whose goal was not to leave Panama under any circumstances, was
                    delighted to have Cordovez in the picture because he knew that Cordovez could be
                    manipulated and could never on his own get Noriega to leave Panama. So, as far
                    as he was concerned, that was just fine. At the same time, he was happy to know
                    of me. He thought that I was one guy he could pull a U.S. deal with. Obviously,
                    “pulling a deal” with the U.S. meant dropping the indictment. Noriega had no
                    illusions about Diego Cordovez ever being able to get the U.S. to drop the
                    indictment.</p>
                <p>At this point a new, seemingly innocuous development enters the picture. USIA's
                    WorldNet proposed an interview to the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs. They
                    wanted to do a program for use in Brazil about the Panama crisis. I had been in
                    Brazil and spoke Portuguese and Luigi talked to me about it. He said, “You do
                    it.” I went over there and did it. That was where disaster struck. Instead of
                    things beginning to move forward, they started to unravel for me. In the
                    interview, I was saying all the right things until I was asked the question,
                    “What about Noriega?” Now I said the key phrase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the interview that was taking place in Portuguese
                        for program that USIA was going to play in Brazil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That's correct. Now come the fatal words. The interviewer said, “What
                    about Noriega? Is he going to leave Panama?” I said, “I don't know, but I know
                    Noriega and he is a friend of mine. I believe that he is going to do what's
                    right for Panama in the end, which means that he'll leave.” The next thing I
                    know, they're taking this “sensational” statement made in Portuguese for a
                    Brazilian audience, translating it into Spanish, and sending it down to Panama.
                    The instant that happens, the Panamanian democratic opposition leadership, many
                    of whom were sitting up here on K Street in Washington lobbying for a return to
                    democracy, said, “What's going on here?” This could not have been a casual
                    statement. The U.S. is about to make a deal with Noriega behind our backs. Who
                    is this guy Dachi? Is the State Department going to sell us out again?” I am not
                    sure how exactly my being a “friend” of Noriega, having him leave Panama or, for
                    that matter, dropping the Miami indictment, even if true, could possibly have
                    been bad for the interests of Panama's democratic politicians, but we will never
                    know what their deep distrust of the State Department might have stirred up in
                    their imagination.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>The first guy to hear about it from them was Art Davis, sitting in the State
                    Department angry and upset that they're not letting him go back to Panama to
                    resume his ambassadorship. He said, “Who is this guy? This is some kind of a
                    plot. I am the one who is supposed to be doing it, not him. What is this guy
                    talking about he's going to make a trip to Panama? What kind of trip to Panama
                    is he going to make? Who is he to be making a trip to Panama?” More
                    significantly, at about this time intelligence reports are starting to pick up
                    quotes by Noriega, who is saying to his people in Panama, “I know this guy,
                    Dachi, and he is in the right place. That means something is going to be worked
                    out. I don't know what it is yet, but something is going to be worked out.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Your friend.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. And he is telling the Ecuadorean Foreign Minister, “Relax. There is
                    some kind of a deal with the U.S. that is going to be worked out here.” He
                    didn't want Cordovez to come to Panama and muddy the waters. As far as Cordovez
                    was concerned, going to Panama was the last thing he wanted to do anyway, so
                    talking him out of it was the easiest thing in the world. The only thing wrong
                    with all that was, Noriega didn't know that by that time both my trip and
                    interest in a “deal” acceptable to the U.S. had been taken off the front burner
                    in Washington, mainly so that Cordovez would have his chance of doing this the
                    “OAS way.” At this point, we were very anxious for the Ecuadorean to get
                    involved, go to Panama and be the one to persuade Noriega to leave. Noriega, by
                    neutralizing him, scaring him off and falsely implying that, yes, there is a
                    back channel deal in the works with me, managed to “screw up the works” in a big
                    way. Intelligence is picking this up, passing it on to the Panamanian opposition
                    politicians who are passing it on to Art Davis. Art Davis begins to make his
                    concerns known. The secret plan for me to go to Panama that Bernie Aronson had
                    hatched is now coming unraveled.</p>
                <p>But that is not the end of it. Art Davis had previously been ambassador to
                    Paraguay, where his wife had perished in an Eastern Airlines crash when the
                    plane flew into a snow-covered mountain. Afterwards, his wife's role as first
                    lady was taken over by his daughter, Susan Davis. From then on, she played a
                    powerful role in running Art Davis' life. Art Davis was a sweet guy, but the
                    “tough lady” behind Art Davis was his daughter. Susan Davis happened to be an
                    intimate friend of Debbie DeMoss, who was Jesse Helms' Foreign Affairs Committee
                    senior staffer for Latin America and had a well-earned reputation as Helms'
                    “hatchet woman.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She is the one who later married a member of the junta
                        down iHonduras.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>DACHI: That's right. They were either college classmates or whatever. Susan Davis
                    was worried that somebody was trying to do her father in by hatching a plot with
                    Noriega, and that the guy behind this had to be Bernie Aronson. Obviously, he
                    was the Assistant Secretary. He had just been sworn in 24 hours before.
                    Initially, he was her prime suspect. Not surprisingly, Jesse Helms had been
                    opposed to Secretary of State James Baker choosing Bernie, a Democrat with labor
                    ties and suspected leftist inclinations for that post. Helms had been most
                    reluctant to confirm the guy. Among other things, he learned that there was a
                    chance encounter in Buenos Aires in which Bernie Aronson had talked to one of
                    the Sandinista comandantes at a reception. That made him suspicious. And, now he
                    hears that they're trying to send somebody other than Art Davis down there to
                    cook up a deal with Noriega.</p>
                <p>While he's getting all this stuff through his intelligence sources and from his
                    staff's feverish mind, Susan Davis is looking out for her father. And her friend
                    Debbie DeMoss takes all this as a gift from Heaven, seeing it as a way to get
                    back at Bernie Aronson. As far as they were concerned, this looked like somebody
                    at the State Department was once again pulling some kind of back channel deal to
                    undermine the President's foreign policy. When they learned that I had talked to
                    the Panamanian ambassador to the OAS, they had their “smoking gun.” They looked
                    into the man's background. It turns out that the man in question, prior to
                    becoming Noriega's Ambassador to the OAS, had been a lobbyist in Washington for
                    Uganda and Idi Amin. I am sure that nobody at the State Department had any idea.
                    That was all they needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a very brutal ruler, accused of eating his
                        opponents and things like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Yeah, and he had me for lunch from his exile 5,000 miles away. The next
                    thing I know, Jesse Helms is making a speech on the floor of the Senate
                    denouncing me by name and accusing me of working on a deal with Noriega through
                    a former lobbyist for Idi Amin, to undermine George Bush's foreign policy, aided
                    and abetted by Bernie Aronson. By this time, you can see that for me, things
                    were coming apart at the seams. Bernie Aronson either had to get rid of me or he
                    had to get rid of himself. That was not a hard choice. There was nothing anyone
                    could do. Everybody had their own interests, legitimate or otherwise, but the
                    bottom line was that Noriega was convinced that I was his guy and, as long as I
                    was on the scene, it looked like the Ecuadorean Foreign Minister was not going
                    to move. If he wasn't going to move, that was contrary to our interests so I had
                    to be removed from the picture. Within three or four weeks of getting there, I
                    was toast. I was there for a total of six weeks. After all this happened, I only
                    lasted another two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During all this, were you getting any reflections through
                        anybodfrom the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Funny you should ask. I don't know whether that's innocent.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's innocent! But the NSC is always in these things when
                        igets political.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Here is the story on the NSC. At that juncture the top guy for Latin
                    America at the NSC was Ted Briggs. He was a good friend of mine. Ted had been
                    ambassador to Panama. As a matter of fact, he went there to be ambassador in
                    1983 or 1984. He and I had been the two finalists at that time to be ambassador
                    to Panama. The Panamanian government had asked for me, but that doesn't usually
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it usually is counterproductive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: It shouldn't work, frankly. When Ted became ambassador he took an unusual
                    step that I certainly didn't expect, of coming over to my office to say, “Look,
                    I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll get it the next time around.” That was an
                    extraordinary gesture on his part and I was deeply appreciative for it. Panama
                    was Ted's second embassy. After he finished there, he came back to Washington to
                    be the Latin American advisor at the NSC. (Now he is head of the Americas
                    Society in New York.) He is a pretty top guy and very conservative.</p>
                <p>Ted Briggs was very much in contact with the Panamanian democratic exiles here in
                    Washington. I don't know all the things that Ted Briggs was up to, but he most
                    assuredly could not be accused of being a “friend of Noriega.” Nevertheless, he
                    somehow got crosswise with Bernie Aronson, who had his own channel with the
                    exiles through one of his deputies, Michael Kozak. To my utter amazement, Ted
                    Briggs lost his job at the NSC. Bernie Aronson convinced Secretary Baker to get
                    rid of him. I don't think Bernie was prepared to tolerate a rival power center
                    at the NSC, even in the person of someone as well known, qualified and respected
                    as Ted Briggs. Ted was exiled a lot more luxuriously than I was, however, he
                    became ambassador to Portugal. But he got jostled out of the NSC by Bernie
                    Aronson. Where he had come down on this stuff I don't really know, but I saw him
                    a couple of times in that period. After it was all over, I told him what
                    happened. He just looked at me and said, “Were you set up?” The answer was
                    clearly yes, but things had become so complicated that it was hard to explain to
                    him exactly how and why it happened. In any case, we all know that people at all
                    levels become victims of “political homicide” in this town at a moment's notice
                    (or without it) every day of the week.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>In Washington, situations like this can turn ugly very quickly. In this case, it
                    seemed like they were even uglier and more complicated than usual. They were
                    just too many people and political factors involved. One thing is certain. If
                    Bernie Aronson could get rid of Ted Briggs, he sure as hell could get rid of me.
                    Luigi Einaudi, who under other circumstances might have tried to defend his DCM,
                    was absolutely not in a position to do so because he himself had not been
                    confirmed in the Senate yet and Bernie Aronson had tremendous doubts about him
                    as well. He didn't trust him either. He had a great question in his mind as to
                    whether he should be ambassador at all. Luigi was very concerned, and rightly
                    so, about this entire thing, but there wasn't anything he could have done. He
                    felt badly about it, but he couldn't really weigh in too vigorously under the
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>So, basically, Bernie just acted. In order to try and move me out of there as
                    smoothly as possible, they called in the Inspector General to look into the
                    case. The inspectors interviewed a lot of people and went through a procedure
                    designed to resemble due process, but all along it was perfectly clear that
                    Bernie Aronson wanted me out of there, so in the end, the inspectors simply had
                    no choice but to recommend that I be transferred.</p>
                <p>To go back a few days in time, somebody from “CNN Spanish” also interviewed me in
                    the same period I did the Brazilian thing. I said the same things in that
                    interview. Unbeknownst to me, the person who talked to me was also a friend of
                    Debbie DeMoss and Susan Davis, as well as being closely tied in with the
                    Panamanian exiles in Washington. An extraordinary thing happened with the tape
                    of that interview. CNN never used it, presumably because the editors did not
                    consider it newsworthy, but in violation of all the ethics of journalistic
                    practice the interviewer held a “private showing” for and in essence gave a
                    “scoop” to the Washington-based Panamanians. She also gave the tape to Debbie
                    and Susan who in turn took it to Jesse Helms. Debbie DeMoss, who speaks perfect
                    Spanish, took over from there. She didn't quote me out of context, she did
                    something more serious than that. Debbie and Susan Davis deliberately crafted an
                    incorrect and distorted translation into English, to make it sound as if I was
                    conspiring with this former lobbyist for Idi Amin and with Noriega. That was
                    what really led Jesse to make that speech on the Senate floor. In fairness, I
                    should add that Debbie did not demand my scalp, she even told the inspectors
                    that this was “nothing personal” against me. She was after bigger fish, Bernie
                    Aronson to be exact, but the head on the silver platter ended up being mine.I
                    had a friend, a congressman from North Carolina whom I had met in Brazil, who
                    actually was the congressman from Jesse's district, that I could have gone to
                    ask him to take me to Jesse and get this straightened out. I was thinking of
                    going to Helms and saying, “Look, Senator, give me five minutes here to present
                    you the facts and get this straightened out because I certainly wouldn't want
                    you to think that I would undermine U.S. foreign policy. That is the last thing
                    on earth that I would ever think of doing.” But not even that could be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Why? For two reasons. First, Debbie DeMoss couldn't possibly back down from her
                    assertion. Susan Davis was a close personal friend and she had to protect her as
                    well as herself. She insisted to Jesse Helms to the end that the information she
                    had given him was truthful and correct. Second, Bernie Aronson told me from the
                    outset, “Don't you go up there and talk to Jesse Helms or anybody else. You
                    can't do that.” Why was that? Because his situation at that time, just days
                    after being sworn in was too tenuous. He sure as hell wasn't going to fall on
                    his sword on account of this, after all he had gone through to get
                    confirmed.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, it is perfectly obvious that this was a tempest in a teapot.
                    Bernie may have thrown a small fry like me to the wolves without batting an eye,
                    but surely even he must have known that my departure from the OAS would have no
                    impact whatsoever. As subsequent events showed, Diego Cordovez still refused to
                    get involved, Noriega stayed put, and before the end of the year we had to
                    resort to intervening militarily in Panama and capturing Noriega in the
                    process.</p>
                <p>What happened to me was certainly very traumatic, but in the grand scheme of
                    things it was of no great importance. The truth is that if you look at it
                    historically, Bernie Aronson ended up being an outstanding Assistant Secretary
                    of State. It was on his watch that the Nicaraguan and Salvadorean situations
                    were finally resolved. You have to give him full credit for that. He did it for
                    George Bush and JiBaker and he did it successfully. Nicaragua now has a
                    democratic government, as does El Salvador. So, you have to give him credit. But
                    that was small consolation to me. My career in the foreign service was over for
                    all intents and purposes.</p>
                <p>Q: I think one of the things you're pointing out and I've seen reflected other
                    times is that when an administration comes in, which the Bush one was (and I saw
                    this with the Clinton administration), it is very fragile. People don't know
                    each other. They don't really trust each other. Their ties to Congress haven't
                    been built up. So, if they receive any sort of shock, their tendency is to get
                    rid of whoever it is. They don't feel strong enough to fight things out or to
                    reason things out. They don't have their own confidence and the confidence of
                    those who work for them.</p>
                <p>DACHI: That is a perfect analysis. That is precisely how and why it happened. At
                    first when this flap over my statement arose, Bernie actually came out with a
                    fairly strong statement backing me. Once Jesse Helms got into it, that changed
                    the nature of the situation totally. I became a highly expendable commodity. I
                    think I've told you this story in a relatively detached fashion. By now I
                    understand what happened, but it devastated me at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: The thing is that most of us are not like politicians who have this happen
                    again and again and again and they develop a tough skin or they get out of the
                    business. When all of a sudden we become the object of political pushing and
                    shoving as government servants, it really does... What did you do?</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>DACHI: You mean before my assignment actually ended?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it play out for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Actually, Bernie came into my office. He said, “Stop everything. Don't go
                    up there. Just stop everything. Let's take a look at what's going on. Let's take
                    stock.” I said, “Do you want me to resign?” He didn't say “Yes,” but he had a
                    facial expression that essentially said “Yes, I'm glad you suggested it.” Then
                    Mike Kozak, who was one of his deputies, who was a supporter and friend of mine,
                    came up with the idea of the inspectors as a possible way out. Mike Kozak had
                    been crucified himself a couple of times both before that and since for similar
                    political problems, so he sympathized somewhat. He said, “Let's have an
                    investigation by the Office of the Inspector General.” That took about another
                    two weeks.</p>
                <p>The Inspector General's office responded very quickly and they agreed to assign
                    two people to this. These two people came in and interviewed everybody. During
                    that time everything was on hold. I myself was talking to all kinds of people,
                    including my son, who was a congressional aide at the time, to see what I could
                    possibly do. There was a Jesse Helms political appointee at the OAS mission who
                    was sympathetic to me and who was trying to be helpful. We went through hours of
                    conversation as to what we could do to deal with this. But I think that from
                    this picture I've painted, you can see that there really was no way to untangle
                    this. So, the inspection's conclusion was that it was unfortunate that this
                    happened, but the only way out, given Bernie Aronson's position, was to
                    recommend “curtailment.” In their report, they said that it was unwise for me to
                    have said what I did about Noriega being a friend of mine. As a gesture to me,
                    they didn't say I used bad judgment, they said it was “unwise.”</p>
                <p>What tilted it for them was when they went up and talked to Debbie DeMoss and she
                    gave them this tape. The tape might have been subject to varying
                    interpretations, but by the time they distorted it in translation, it was out
                    and out prejudicial. The inspectors only listened to the English version. What
                    was I going to say, that Debbie DeMoss distorted the translation? I couldn't do
                    that. It was beside the point anyway. Bernie Aronson's position was, “Say what
                    you like. Our bottom line problem is that the Ecuadorean Foreign Minister is
                    convinced that there is something going on here with a back channel deal and he
                    will not move. We have to get him to move. As long as Noriega thinks that Dachi
                    is at the OAS, he is going to keep the Ecuadorean at bay. Something has to give.
                    It's pretty obvious. So, forget about this other stuff.” So, they all agreed
                    that I had to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>The inspectors recommended that I be given another job at the Department. Mike
                    Kozak told me that Bernie Aronson and Lawrence Eagleburger the Deputy Secretary
                    of State, were saying that they would do everything possible to get me another
                    job. Mike said, “You look on the radar screen and see what there is by way of
                    openings that you think you would like to try to get and these people will help
                    you get it. It's unfortunate that you have to leave. Of course, you had
                    something to do with it. It wasn't all our fault. However you want to distribute
                    the blame here, we'll do what we can to get you another job.” But that didn't
                    work out for a variety of reasons. There wasn't really anything else open at the
                    moment. So, I withdrew to lick my wounds.</p>
                <p>To move on to the next chapter in the story, one day I got on the Metro to go to
                    USIA and talk to the Personnel Office to see what they might have available for
                    me. On the train, I ran into a former colleague, Stan Burnett, who was a retired
                    USIA officer and was now Director of Studies at the Center for Strategic and
                    International Studies (CSIS). After hearing my story, he said, “Listen, why
                    don't you come here as a Visiting Fellow for a year? We'll get you over here on
                    a “non-reimbursable detail.” USIA was only too happy to accommodate me. They
                    felt sorry about what had happened. So I ended up at CSIS for what was going to
                    be a year. Within a few months, I had a major heart attack and had to have
                    bypass surgery. That took me out of circulation for a few months. So I ended up
                    staying at CSIS for more like two years. Then I was sent to India as Public
                    Affairs Officer (PAO). Obviously, my Foreign Service career was over and done
                    with. Being PAO in New Delhi is no disgrace by any means, it's a large post and
                    it turned out to be a very interesting assignment, but obviously my future fate
                    was sealed.</p>
                <p>Q: This often is the classic tale of what happens when a professional ends up
                    tangling with the political side of things. It's the professional who gets
                    hurt.</p>
                <p>DACHI: I don't know how many hundreds of hours I've agonized over this, but it's
                    been hundreds. If I could have found a way in those hundreds of hours to cast
                    the entire blame on others, believe me, I would have done it. But whatever share
                    of the blame I bear, I have mercilessly tortured myself with the thought that
                    surely after seeing it happen to others, I should not have let it happen to me.
                    Somehow, I should have been able to see this and avoided it. That is torturing
                    me to this day.</p>
                <p>Q: I recall one time I was interviewed when I was the Consul General in Athens. I
                    made the statement to an American individual (not the press), “Balkan justice is
                    not American justice.” The fact that I talked about Greek justice in some case
                    in which an American was involved, I stated that Greece was a Balkan country,
                    got on the front pages of all the local Greek papers.: “We're not Balkan” and
                    all this. There is that thing of thinking, “Oh, God, if I had only not said
                    that.” The thing gets misconstrued and has a life of its own. There it is. These
                    things happen. I think this is a very instructive thing to get out. Playing it
                    back, there is no real answer to this. This is essentially a matter of fact
                    statement that became a political football.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>DACHI: Well, I have played it back 50,000 times to myself and haven't come up
                    with an answer yet. The only thing I wish is that I could find a way to put this
                    out of my mind. In ten years, I have not been able to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: View this as a psychiatric session. And now you have laid
                        it oufor the public and there it goes. Forget it!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What about India? You were in India from when to when?</p>
                <p>DACHI: I was in India from 1991 to 1994. That was very nice. When I went to
                    India, I said, “I will not get into trouble with anybody ever again.” I went out
                    there and was a different person. I tried to be a team player. I didn't get into
                    fights with anybody. It turned out to be a very interesting assignment.</p>
                <p>I think implicit in what we've been talking about... I was consul general in Sao
                    Paulo. The scope of that job was light years ahead of anything else I had done
                    in every respect. It was a large mission doing important issues. When I finished
                    in Sao Paulo, George Landau who had been a great ambassador, tried to recruit me
                    to be his deputy at the Americas Society in New York, where he had gone to be
                    Director after his retirement from the Foreign Service. He said, “You have just
                    hit the peak of your career. The smartest thing you can do now is retire and
                    come to work for us.” Well, there were a number of reasons why my wife and I
                    thought about it and decided not to do it. When I said “No” to him, he said, “I
                    can see why you're doing this. You don't want to do it because you think that
                    you are going to become an ambassador and you don't want to cut your chances off
                    from doing that. I can tell you you're not going to become an ambassador, it is
                    not in the cards for somebody from USIA. But, I understand you doing this. I
                    wouldn't want you to come here if you're going to sit here in this office next
                    to mine and the first time you get mad at me, you're going to say, “Dammit, I
                    could have been ambassador to Peru and instead I came to work for this bastard,
                    George Landau and you'll never forgive me. Go right ahead and see if you'll ever
                    become an ambassador. I wouldn't want to deprive you of the opportunity to get
                    frustrated in your own way.”</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Be that as it may, leaving any emotional and personal factors aside, no one can
                    argue that the scope of the job I had in Sao Paulo was beyond anything else that
                    I could aspire to get in the future. Certainly the job in New Delhi was nice and
                    most interesting, I'm glad I did it, I got a lot out of it and I think I did
                    some useful things there. But it was no Sao Paulo. At the same time, after what
                    happened in Washington and my travails there, it was a positive experience for
                    which I was grateful.As it turned out, we went for 18 months in New Delhi
                    without an ambassador during my time there. For half my tour, I was de facto
                    acting DCM with a charg� d'affaires, Kenneth Brill, now Ambassador to Cyprus,
                    who was an absolutely outstanding individual of whom I was very fond and whom I
                    admired greatly. My professional relationship with him I enjoyed personally more
                    than I've ever enjoyed working with anyone else. So, it was just wonderful. That
                    18 months, when he and I were there working together in the front office was
                    just great. That made a big difference. The other thing about being in India was
                    that it's such an interesting place. The history, the culture, the religion, the
                    civilization is so different from anything I had ever encountered anywhere else.
                    It was a great learning experience. From a working standpoint on the other hand,
                    India is very frustrating and exasperating. It is very difficult to get anything
                    done in India. India and the U.S. have had a very rocky, frustrating, up and
                    down relationship ever since their independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are two basically arrogant countries which each
                        believe hathe unique wisdom of how the world should be run.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: That's right. And each genuinely believes that of the other. It was
                    difficult. On the other hand, India was just entering this period of change and
                    economic reform that now has acquired a certain life of its own. So, it was a
                    good time to be there. It was a good tour, all things considered.</p>
                <p>Q: I have a couple of questions about India at this time. We're talking about
                    1991-1994. You were the PAO. What was your impression of the Indian press?</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>DACHI: You have to divide it into three. The English language press, which is the
                    national press and is widely read by the elites, was quite free. It was fairly
                    good. But the majority of the people read the vernacular press, which is much
                    more nationalistic and has been slower to shed its virulent anti-U.S. tone, a
                    legacy from all those years when a very close relationship with the Soviet Union
                    dominated the atmosphere. Radio and television during my time were still under
                    absolute, total state control. There was only one radio station in India, All
                    India Radio. News there consisted of texts prepared and released by the Ministry
                    of Information. Television was the same. When a fanatical right wing Hindu mob
                    tore down the mosque in Ayodhya, an event that made headlines and set off alarm
                    bells all over the world, coverage on Indian radio and television was
                    drastically censored. People could learn about it only by listening to foreign
                    broadcasts, which not many were in the habit of doing. Now, satellite and cable
                    have come in and things have changed very significantly. But the free press at
                    that time was mainly the English-language written press. The latter was even
                    able to write about the Ayodhya incident, but since no more than three or four
                    percent of Indians read English, the government did not regard that as a
                    threat.</p>
                <p>The overwhelming factors at that time (and they're still important) are the
                    following. Number one, there is a greater suspicion of foreigners in India than
                    in any other place that I know of. The British period, the East India Company,
                    etched the deepest, most lasting impressions imaginable into Indian hearts and
                    minds. The suspicion of foreigners is pervasive and often poisonous. It makes it
                    very difficult to work there. In Latin America where it is also widespread, it
                    was at its highest in Mexico. But I always thought it was limited to a
                    relatively small circle of people. Throughout Latin America, no matter how
                    anti-American government policies may have been, and even though the population
                    at large always had a sort of love-hate relationship with the U.S., there was
                    always respect, admiration and often envy for a lot of things we have achieved.
                    In India, although there is a segment of people who have relatives here and so
                    on, suspicion of foreigners and the condemnation of American “cultural
                    imperialism” and its consumer society was far wider and deeply held. Many
                    Indians liked to refer to the U.S. as a “society in decline,” and sincerely
                    believed it.</p>
                <p>Aside from the communist countries, India was the only one that never allowed the
                    Embassy to invite anyone from the public sector, and that meant virtually
                    everyone of any importance in policy making, to participate in the International
                    Visitor Program or accept Leader Grants as they were called, to visit the U.S.
                    in a professional capacity. They insisted that any such grantees had to be
                    chosen and designated exclusively by the Indian government, a provision which
                    has always been unacceptable to us. They were so afraid of being brainwashed or
                    “subverted by the CIA,” they couldn't contemplate such a program even in the
                    first few years after the collapse of the Soviet Union when I served there. As a
                    result, we wasted countless grants on people of little importance, by that I
                    mean without prospects of becoming leaders or occupying prominent positions (the
                    purpose of the IV program) simply because they held no public position and were
                    available to travel.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Number two, admittedly I was there at the very beginning of economic reforms,
                    privatization, liberalization of trade and so on, but the opposition to these
                    changes was wider, broader, and deeper than anywhere else. Even now that I'm
                    teaching a course on the global economy at Georgetown and I do comparative
                    studies with other countries including China, I still believe that to be true.
                    Today I saw a story in “The Washington Post” in connection with President
                    Clinton's visit to Brazil. It wasn't about Clinton. It just said that Brazil is
                    very hesitant and afraid of this free trade that Bill Clinton is advocating,
                    because it would mean going much faster toward opening up markets. Domestic
                    companies were reportedly afraid that they would go under if this opening is too
                    fast. Therefore, there was resistance. Nowhere is that more true than in India.
                    There is resistance to that kind of economic liberalization and opening of trade
                    almost everywhere where the formally protected industries are trying to slow
                    things down because they're justifiably afraid they'll go under. But in India,
                    the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and his advocacy of self-reliance and swadeshi, the
                    word they use to describe it, is still deeply ingrained. It has now been revived
                    by the BJP, the Hindu nationalist party and the opposition to economic reforms
                    and globalization is as widespread as ever.</p>
                <p>Specifically, there is an enormous ideological opposition to bringing in foreign
                    consumer goods and also to attracting foreign investment to certain key sectors.
                    They feel that this will bring in Western values and undermine their culture. At
                    the same time, the bureaucracy fears the loss of control this implies over a
                    socialist economy it has ruled and regulated almost to death over the past fifty
                    years. Obviously I am referring to official circles. I don't know of any place
                    in the world where the consumers are opposed to having access to western goods.
                    Ideological and cultural resistance to economic reforms at this level of
                    intensity is not what drives resistance to change in most countries globalizing
                    today. In the latter, it comes from the vested interests of old-line businesses
                    fighting for survival and the bureaucrats who regulate and control the system of
                    protectionism and a closed economy. Not in India. In India, the business
                    considerations may be present but ideology continues to play the dominant
                    role.</p>
                <p>Another thing that is unique to India is the Hindu philosophy of life, which to
                    the western mind is very hard to understand, almost unfathomable. It is
                    extremely conservative and resistant to change, particularly to new and
                    modernizing ideas from the outside. The faster the outside world moves, the
                    faster change, innovation, and technology, all these things that are anathema to
                    Asian religions and cultural values insinuate themselves from the outside, the
                    more apprehension and fear it generates. If you add up these factors, you're
                    talking about a place where extraordinary challenges face us in trying to
                    reconcile our contrasting views on foreign policy and economic questions, before
                    you even get to the intractable issues like Kashmir and nuclear policy.</p>
                <p>Q: This time you were there saw the absolute disintegration of the Soviet Union
                    into an empire that is gone. India has always used the Soviet Union as being its
                    friend, as a counterweight to the United States. Did you sense in the people you
                    dealt with there any disquiet on the fact that their friend to the north had
                    disappeared?</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>DACHI: Oh, enormous disquiet. It was a big factor. I have a theory on that. When
                    I first got there, it was just as the Soviet Union was disappearing. In my
                    previous assignments overseas, when you had contact with Soviet diplomats, you
                    had to report every meeting, every conversation to the Embassy security officer.
                    The Soviets were always suspected (with good reason) of trying to recruit or
                    subvert you. They were usually people who were very ill at ease if they
                    unexpectedly met an American diplomat, were hard to reach, often
                    uncommunicative, and so on. I showed up in India just as the Soviet Union was
                    disappearing and, all of a sudden, these very same diplomats, now known as
                    Russians rather than Soviets, morphed into the most friendly, “democratically
                    oriented,” capitalism espousing people, talking to us like we had been friends
                    forever. It took them about 24 hours to change their spots. Yet they were the
                    very same guys who a year before, and even two weeks before, were the heavy
                    gumshoes.</p>
                <p>I had served in Hungary for four years in the '70s and had extensive exposure to
                    this kind of world. I always thought that most of the people over there claiming
                    to be communists were in reality just opportunists and careerists. I always
                    maintained that the number of convinced Marxist- Leninists in the communist
                    world was very, very small. Not so in India. The people claiming to be Marxists
                    or communists really believe in it. Most of the “true believers” weren't in
                    Moscow or Beijing all along. They were in New Delhi, in government, in Indian
                    universities and in the labor movement, and still are. The academics still
                    believe in this stuff. There are still two sizable, fully functioning communist
                    parties in India.</p>
                <p>Why? My theory is not implausible. How did communism come to China? Mao Tse Tung
                    imposed it ruthlessly by killing off everybody, mainly land owners, who was
                    against it. How did communism come to Russia? Lenin and Stalin killed everybody
                    that stood in their way. How did communism come to Eastern Europe? With the Red
                    Army imposing it at the end of World War II, with puppets who spent the
                    inter-war period being trained in Moscow and foisted on each country. So,
                    communism in those countries was imposed by brute force on all these people. The
                    kind of socialism that came to India, on the other hand, was not imposed by
                    anybody. It was brought in by unquestioned intellectual leaders who were revered
                    as the fathers of independent India, first and foremost, Jawaharlal Nehru and,
                    to a great degree, Mahatma Gandhi. A similar phenomenon took place elsewhere in
                    South Asia, like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Gandhi and Nehru were the fathers of
                    an independent and democratic India, people who learned their Marxism in London,
                    who were much more pure of heart than the likes oMao, Lenin and Stalin. They
                    actually convinced people by their moral stature and their character. As a
                    result, they made millions of genuine converts because they were credible people
                    who never resorted to the kind of totalitarian steps that these others did. You
                    can see the consequences today. India is virtually the only place in the world
                    where there are still thousands and thousands of Marxist and communist true
                    believers.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>I remember visiting a university campus in Calcutta once. I couldn't believe my
                    eyes. The walls were plastered with huge posters of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
                    Stalin. Marx and Lenin, okay. But Engels and Stalin? It took me back to my days
                    as a school boy in Romania in 1947 and 1948 when we had to go out marching in
                    parades as “little red pioneers” carrying placards of those four. I haven't seen
                    displays of Stalin posters anywhere in the world since the late 1950s.</p>
                <p>To a certain extent all that is beginning to slowly erode now. In the last few
                    years, the revisionist historians on Jawaharlal Nehru have multiplied rapidly.
                    Jawaharlal Nehru is being viewed in much less favorable terms than he was at one
                    time, and many of his philosophies on which independent India was founded in
                    1947 are now seen as having been misguided. Many of the old ideological premises
                    which went unchallenged for nearly fifty years are no longer taboo. But the
                    transformation in people's minds is not as fast as it had been in China and
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>Q: I have my own personal theory that the Fabian socialists, the brother and
                    sister in England, had a much more pernicious impact on the Third World (Africa,
                    India, and other places) than did Marx and Engels.</p>
                <p>DACHI: There you have it. I agree with you completely. I left Romania in 1948 to
                    emigrate to the West. I went to Canada and the United States and forgot all
                    about Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. It was not until I went to Calcutta in
                    1992 that I saw them again. I asked somebody, “How do you explain the Soviet
                    Union's disappearance?” The answer I got was that there is nothing wrong with
                    communism, it is still the best system. The reason the Soviet Union collapsed
                    was that Gorbachev screwed it up and mismanaged it.</p>
                <p>Q: Particularly as a public affairs officer, you're sort of the point man in
                    dealing with the intellectuals. In some countries, intellectuals are important;
                    in other places, they aren't. What about the intellectual class and your contact
                    with them in India?</p>
                <p>DACHI: I did have some contact with the intellectual class. I lay the emphasis on
                    “some” because the maximum contact I've had with the intellectual class was in
                    Hungary. In those days in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, intellectuals
                    were really important. The intellectual class in Hungary, which was basically
                    western-oriented, just reached out to me. They craved any contact with and
                    access to western culture that they could get near. Again, there was an article
                    either today or yesterday in “The Washington Post” about how former Soviet
                    dissidents are at sea because they've lost their status. Indian intellectuals on
                    the other hand, almost without exception looked down their noses at western
                    culture and felt no need for contacts with a lowly U.S. Embassy officer to
                    discuss it. After Hungary I went to Panama. There was no intellectual class
                    there at all. There is damn little of it in Brazil. In India, there is an
                    intellectual class, but most of their thinking is on a different planet and, as
                    I was saying, most of them were not particularly interested in mingling with an
                    American public affairs officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>In Hungary, I used to have lunch with editors of journals who used to hang on my
                    every word. I was one of the few sources who in their own language could talk to
                    them about U.S. culture, life, politics and so on. They were dying to hear
                    another version, even if they couldn't write about it. I don't know how many
                    lunches I had with Indian editors. They didn't care what I said. They were there
                    to tell me where I was wrong, where the U.S. was wrong, explaining to me things
                    that they were sure I didn't understand about India. It was ships passing in the
                    night. Most of them were nice, very civilized people. Several of them liked me
                    because I had become a “likable chap” in my old age and I didn't seek
                    confrontation in dialogue with them. On non-controversial issues, we could have
                    a nice conversation. But in our position on these intractable issues like
                    nuclear non-proliferation, Kashmir and above all “Western cultural imperialism,”
                    forget it. That's another pernicious thing about U.S.-India relations. They are
                    so heavily dominated by these hopelessly intractable issues. That is why
                    everybody on our side is so desperately looking for rapid growth in U.S. trade
                    and investment, praying that it will go faster and better all the time, so as to
                    finally give us something by way of a constructive, positive element in talking
                    to the Indians.</p>
                <p>In Hungary, I used to have wonderful conversations with journalists about all
                    kinds of things. It didn't matter whether we agreed or not. They were very eager
                    to hear what I had to say and I was eager to hear what they had to say. But in
                    India, everything was so predictable. You could have just said, “Alright, these
                    two people will have lunch. I'll tell you before they ever start exactly what
                    each side is going to say, so you might as well not speak with your mouth full
                    because there is no need to rush. No minds are ever going to be changed.”</p>
                <p>Q: By this time, had the first love worn off? We had had ambassador after
                    ambassador going out there who sort of fell in love with India. We would always
                    tout up India, particularly by some of our political ambassadors, yet when you
                    get right down to it, nothing ever really came of this. The Indians seemed to
                    be, oddly enough, as comfortable or more comfortable with the Soviets than with
                    us.</p>
                <p>DACHI: They were much more comfortable with the Soviets because they were
                    ideologically much closer. And yes, the people who had love affairs with India
                    had faded into the background by the time I got therThere were three
                    ambassadors: Bill Clark, Tom Pickering, and Frank Wisner. They were all vigorous
                    promoters of better relations and labored mightily on the intractable issues,
                    but they had no illusions about India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All three professionals.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>DACHI: Right. For my money, Bill Clark was the best of the three. That may not be
                    what you would expect most people to say given the legendary reputations of
                    Wisner and Pickering. But Bill Clark was very well liked by the Indians and he
                    liked the Indians. Yet he never lost sight of U.S. interests or what he was
                    there for. Although on a personal level he was very, very into the Indian thing
                    in every respect, on the policy side, he was a good, hard-nosed, effective
                    ambassador. I don't mean to say that the others weren't, but Bill Clark had it
                    all in balance. Tom Pickering, I would say, as far as intellectual prowess is
                    concerned, is light years ahead of everybody else. That, in a sense was a
                    disadvantage in India.</p>
                <p>We as Americans collectively have this problem that we believe that if you really
                    understand a problem thoroughly, we must be able to find a solution to it. If I
                    can bring you around to understanding my point of view, which is based on an
                    objective, dispassionate analysis of the facts, you cannot possibly escape
                    reaching the same conclusions I do. That is an American characteristic (I would
                    say it is virtually embedded in our genetic code) that is particularly disliked
                    in India, I suppose because they believe the same thing themselves. Because Tom
                    Pickering is so brilliant, he was even more a victim of this. He believed that
                    even though all the cogent analyses of the American point of view over the last
                    50 years didn't carry the day, he could argue them just a little bit more
                    clearly and persuasively and, as a consequence, carry the day. He was there for
                    a very short period of time, but he was relentless in the fundamental belief
                    that if you were just rational and articulate enough in arguing your point of
                    view, people could not escape coming to the same logical conclusion that you
                    did. I don't know how long it would have taken him to get frustrated and
                    disappointed, but he got a chance to leave before that moment arrived.</p>
                <p>Frank Wisner, on the other hand, is a guy who believes that no one can resist his
                    charms and that he would inevitably carry the day, not necessarily on the power
                    of irresistible logic, but on his impeccable diplomatic finesse. I think he
                    began to get frustrated after a while. I don't think he left India with the same
                    idealistic vision that he arrived with. So, no one has an old-style love affair
                    with India any more. The last two officers at the Embassy who had love affairs
                    with India had left just before I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, with the great democracy in the world, it was a
                        prettsterile time there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely. We have always said that we are the world's two “greatest
                    democracies.” We were grasping for straws to find a way to give that some
                    practical meaning, to say that we have something in common, some common
                    interests, but the fact is that, if you look at the history of Indo-U.S.
                    relations, it rarely worked out. The fundamental cornerstone of Jawaharlal
                    Nehru's belief that India had to retain its option of an independent foreign
                    policy and not automatically follow the U.S. lead resulted in his policy of
                    non-alignment. That was dealt a crushing blow with the incredibly painful Indian
                    experience of being invaded by China in 1962 and having to ask for help from the
                    United States. That was very painful. After that, things were a little bit
                    better for a brief period, but that too ended in 1971 when the U.S. sided with
                    Pakistan in the Indo-Pak war that led to the independence of Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>Then there was the period in which they had to get wheat from us under PL 480
                    because they were not self-sufficient in wheat. That was just as painful. Most
                    other countries would have been delighted that we gave them such vital aid. To
                    Indians, it was a humiliating experience too painful to ever recall. After Nehru
                    died, Indira Gandhi came in and we had the war in Bangladesh. Even though the
                    Green Revolution took place in about the same period and it was through our
                    research that we were able to provide them this miracle wheat and miracle rice,
                    the key factor in having made India self-sufficient in food, forget it. That
                    didn't count. We tilted toward Pakistan in the case of Bangladesh and she could
                    never forgive us. She signed the Treaty of Friendship with the Soviet Union that
                    same year and started to introduce additional, rather radical socialist measures
                    into the economy. So, things went down again on multiple fronts. Then we
                    increased our cooperation again with Pakistan because of the Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan and the resulting war. That bothered the Indians tremendously. So,
                    there just haven't been many positives there. Rajiv Gandhi had a brief romance
                    with Ronald Reagan, but that didn't last long either. Our relations were not so
                    hot for a long time, really until the Soviet Union collapsed. Then Kashmir and
                    non-proliferation have been this ongoing crisis, forever poisoning the well.</p>
                <p>Now, we're laying our eggs in the trade and investment basket. Certainly much has
                    happened in that field, although it has been much slower and more tortuous than
                    what had been predicted. Without a doubt, it has been an important, positive
                    factor. In the last few years they have also opened up their media. That became
                    inevitable with the advent of satellites and email, making it impossible to
                    control the electronic media. As a result, there is much more media freedom. The
                    consumer society is giving rise to a growing middle class. So, things are moving
                    now more so than I would have predicted when I left there. Things are on a much
                    more positive note today.</p>
                <p>Q: But as a practical matter, for a very long time, India was really not very
                    important to us when the chips were down. It wasn't actively fighting us. It was
                    preaching on the side and we would preach back at it. But it really wasn't very
                    important.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>DACHI: Absolutely true. We were on opposite sides on most foreign affairs issues,
                    they were against us most of the time at the U.N., and we were always perceived
                    as favoring Pakistan over India. (In Pakistan it was the other way around, hence
                    the origin of the term “zero-sum game” perpetually applied to our relations in
                    South Asia.) They condemned us for any aid we gave to Pakistan, especially on
                    the military side and they never acknowledged any aid we gave them, not even the
                    billions of dollars worth of PL-480 food aid we delivered before India became
                    self-sufficient. And, they kept us at arms length on economic relations, trade
                    and investment until their key ally, the Soviet Union collapsed, thus we never
                    derived a strong mutual benefit from any sort of common undertaking. So, rather
                    than being important to us more often than not they were a thorn in our
                    side.</p>
                <p>Again, if a one liner can symbolize that, my son, who at that time was the
                    national security legislative assistant to Senator John Chaffee of Rhode Island,
                    came to visit me while I was in India. He was invited as a speaker at several
                    think tanks and other places because as a Senate aide, he was in great demand.
                    He is very articulate and very bright. He gave some great talks and gave very
                    much the congressional point of view, which goes to the point you made. They
                    would ask him about Kashmir. He would get up in front of these high-powered
                    think tanks and say, “Let's face it. To the population of the United States,
                    Kashmir is a sweater.” That got the point across more effectively than anything
                    else. Congressional people can say anything they want. We can't.</p>
                <p>By the way, the Indians love that kind of talk, or, at least it is the only kind
                    that gets them to sit up and listen. I gave dozens of talks about economic
                    reforms, U.S. policy, and so on. At first, I went in there in the usual way and
                    tried to be helpful and explain. But there would always be people in the
                    audience who had just been waiting for months or years to get a crack at a live
                    U.S. diplomat. As soon as I was through, they would get up, take out their
                    notes, and give speeches instead of questions. They never listened to a word I
                    said. They would come back with all of these anti-American chestnuts they had
                    been roasting over the fire for years. Most of these sessions quickly turned
                    into a dialogue of the deaf. If you try and be too accommodating they just come
                    in and eat you alive.</p>
                <p>The way to get these Indian tormentors to sit down and listen is to be as
                    aggressive as they are and come right back at them. Then all of a sudden, they
                    say, “Oh, okay” and you may actually be able to have a conversation with them. I
                    have had this happen after I learned the hard way. I went once and spoke at a
                    Rotary club, which is generally made up of “friendlies.” So, I decided to give
                    my friendly speech, not the hard one about economic reforms. I got through the
                    first question and a guy got up. I thought this was going to be a love fest, but
                    the guy said, “Look, we all know that the U.S. interest is to maintain the
                    military industrial complex. That is in the U.S. interest to do. So, how do you
                    explain the contradiction between the outward devotion of the U.S. to reduction
                    in arms, disarmament and peace when, in fact, you know that the U.S. interest is
                    to keep the military industrial complex going?”</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>It occurred to me that most people would have tried to answer that question in a
                    sort of apologetic way: “Look, that's not the way it is. Our defense budget has
                    been significantly reduced. President Bush has called for reduction in arms.
                    Even President Reagan has. We have had SALT treaties and so on. It's not so.” I
                    knew that none of that would work, so I didn't say it. I heard him out. When he
                    got through, I said, “I'm glad to have your question because I came here for a
                    dialogue, but don't you come and tell me what U.S. interests are. I am here to
                    tell you what U.S. interests are. I am going to tell you that first. You can ask
                    me questions about anything, but don't tell me what the U.S. interests are. You
                    don't know what U.S. interests are. I am the one who is here to tell you that.”
                    He sat right down. Everybody said, “Wow!” After that, we had a wonderful
                    conversation. But you have to come back at them the same way they come at
                    you.</p>
                <p>You said something earlier about both Indians and Americans thinking they have
                    all the answers. I used that point on one occasion also. When somebody started
                    preaching to me, I said, “You know, Indian and American people have one thing in
                    common that is very, very important to keep in mind. We both think that we have
                    all the answers to the world's problems and we're two of the most generous
                    people on Earth in sharing our advice about it with everybody else around the
                    world.” I think the audience got the message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1994. Did you retire at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: No, I spent a year as a diplomat in residence at Georgetown at the School
                    of Foreign Service. Then I went back to USIA. It turned out that at USIA's NEA
                    the North Africa/Near East, and South Asia area office, both the area director
                    and the deputy left all of a sudden. The area director took a buyout and
                    disappeared overnight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A buyout is a way to get better retirement and leave right
                        away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. His deputy totally unexpectedly was given the assignment of PAO in
                    Cairo, which was a pretty nice job for him. He also left right away. The
                    successor for the area director job, Kenton Keith, who had been ambassador in
                    Qatar, wasn't due until September. I was finished at Georgetown in about May or
                    June. I decided to postpone my retirement for a few months, and accept an offer
                    to be acting director and acting deputy until Kenton Keith got there, he had a
                    chance to choose a deputy and make a trip to the field to visit his posts.
                    Kenton Keith is a guy that I have tremendous affection or respect for and I
                    wanted to help out. That is what happened. Then I retired at the end of
                    February, 1996. While in that position I had a few little interesting
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can talk a minute about those interesting
                        experiences.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>DACHI: One had to do with what still today is an ongoing problem in the Sudan. At
                    USIA, the Sudan still belonged to the NEA area office as opposed to the
                    Department of State, where it was in the Africa Bureau. At one time or another,
                    we had withdrawn and then sent back a PAO several times already. Sometimes we
                    had an ambassador there, sometimes we didn't. One of our ambassadors was
                    assassinated there some years earlier. When I came in, a new ambassador had just
                    gone to Khartoum. We had had a PAO there for just a few months. When I got to
                    NEA, we had all these serious budgetary constraints, that was a year when the
                    worst cuts were being taken. So, people at USIA were saying, “Let's close the
                    Sudan.” I have always had this phobia of opening and closing posts every 18
                    months. So when they said, “Let's close the Sudan,” I thought I would check
                    things out with the Department. It turned out that the ambassador, Tim Carney,
                    was very happy with our PAO there who among other things spoke excellent Arabic.
                    He felt very strongly that the political situation was so tenuous there that the
                    only dialogue you could really have was with intellectuals, journalists, and so
                    on, and that you really needed a PAO there for that. So, the Department was
                    adamant about retaining the post. I went and made a visit there to make the
                    case, because in USIA they were just looking for ways to cut and the Sudan
                    looked like an easy mark.</p>
                <p>I found a very interesting situation in the sense that this PAO was a very
                    extraordinary person, spoke the language well and had a multitude of contacts.
                    She was very effective. Tim Carney was a very good officer and was determined to
                    make progress in sorting out the myriad problems we had with the Sudan, about
                    its support for terrorism and its human rights abuses against the Christian
                    population in the country's south. He had also established a lot of
                    dialogue.</p>
                <p>During my visit, they had some dinners and meetings for me. One night, the
                    ambassador had a dinner for government types. The next night, the DCM had a
                    dinner for me with opposition types. At the Ambassador's dinner, I was talking
                    with the director of one of the government controlled universities. The Sudanese
                    guests seemed to be dismayed about how we were shunning them. The university
                    director said an interesting thing to me. He said, “Look, you've got to
                    understand one thing. Politically, we're now poles apart. Take our university,
                    for instance. We're a government university. We would like to see a closer
                    political relationship, but that is not in the cards right now. But, you have to
                    understand that everybody in this country, regardless of where we stand on the
                    politics of it, know that the United States is the most developed, the most
                    advanced, and the most prosperous country in the world. I don't care who it is
                    you're talking to. Everybody respects and admires Americans. Even though we
                    can't have political relations, we feel that we should be able to have
                    educational and cultural exchanges because everyone is eager to learn from the
                    United States in spite of the momentary political barriers to improving that
                    relationship.”</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I have heard that before in many communist countries. It's a very important thing
                    that we always lose sight of in this country, that it is vitally important to
                    maintain a dialogue with constructive elements, particularly in a country where
                    we have difficult or tense relations with a hostile and repressive regime. At
                    the dinner with the opposition types who were mostly academics, I was really
                    struck by how well read and how literate and pro-Western these people were. This
                    was very unlike what you would run into in a lot of African countries. It was
                    more like in Egypt, very worldly, very high caliber intellectually.</p>
                <p>Both the ambassador and the PAO were talking to me with great passion about
                    trying to rebuild the Fulbright Program, flesh out the academic exchanges and
                    have better relations with the media. We had just gotten a new residence for the
                    PAO where she could hold her USIS programs and speakers without people having to
                    go to the embassy, and we set up a lovely program facility there. I came back to
                    Washington and wrote a memorandum and in essence saved the program. I didn't
                    know it was going to be so short-lived. But for the moment at least, I succeeded
                    in convincing the higher-ups at USIA that this was definitely important to our
                    interests. Unfortunately, shortly after my return we ran into security problems
                    and terrorist threats and next thing you know, the State Department decided to
                    close the embassy once again. They withdrew all the Americans. That was another
                    one of those things where everybody on the political side was saying that we
                    should stay there. But the people in the intelligence and security agencies were
                    strongly opposed to it and they won out.</p>
                <p>Q: It's very hard when you're faced in Washington with something where they say,
                    “The threat to American life is significant.” You might have a little problem
                    justifying it, but you've got a very big problem if an American gets killed.</p>
                <p>DACHI: Right. Once you get the security people going, there is no turning back.
                    So, we stationed Tim Carney in Nairobi, and he visited Khartoum frequently from
                    there. We did the same with our PAO. But under those circumstances, the USIA
                    program didn't survive.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Really the only other thing worth mentioning is that this was a period when we
                    had to make drastic cuts in USIA budgets and personnel throughout NEA, as well
                    as in all the other areas. Only the Middle East was untouchable. Since you can't
                    reduce programs in Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, the brunt of
                    the cuts had to come in South Asia. Of course, India traditionally had a huge
                    staff which, truth be told, could easily be cut. It would be hard to argue that
                    you shouldn't cut it. We had always had a huge staff in India, commensurate not
                    with reality but with our romantic fantasy about the importance of that country.
                    Of course, you can lay off two hundred Foreign Service National USIS employees
                    in India and save very little money, but nevertheless those cuts were made. You
                    could argue that our interests in India have increased but still....Then we've
                    got a country like Sri Lanka where you're really hard pressed to come up with a
                    rationale for U.S. interests. You can cut back a lot there. Poor Bangladesh got
                    caught in this vice also. That is one of the areas where, again, USIA had gone
                    too far. So, I went out to Dacca. The ambassador and I worked out a compromise
                    in which we preserved the viability of USIS/Dacca.</p>
                <p>That was about it. Basically, I was just holding the fort for Kenton Keith. Just
                    before I retired, they had an unexpected vacancy for PAO in Pakistan and Kenton
                    wanted me to take that. But I decided when leaving India that I was retiring, so
                    I did.</p>

                        affairsince then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DACHI: Yes. I teach a course at Georgetown. I have the South Asian Area Studies
                    seminar here at FSI. I have a small international business consulting activity,
                    mostly in Latin America and Central Europe. So, I'm fine. These things take up
                    about 2/3 to 3/4 of my time, which means that I have about two to three months
                    of leisure time. The rest of the time, I am engaged in some things that I enjoy
                    very much and bring in a little bit of spending money.</p>
