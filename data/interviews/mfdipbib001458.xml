                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 19, 2000. This is an interview with
                        Helmut Sonnenfeldt. Let's start. When and where were you born and something
                        about the background of your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1926. My parents were both
                    physicians, and they were practicing under the German state health insurance
                    system in a small rural town 120 km. west of Berlin. My mother was interested in
                    obstetrics and she'd been trained in it, in addition to other aspects of
                    medicine. She very much wanted her children to be delivered by her professor of
                    obstetrics, who worked in Berlin at a highly respected clinic. So my brother had
                    been delivered there in 1923, and I was delivered there in 1926. So Berlin was
                    my birthplace, but I grew up in this small town west of Berlin. It was a county
                    seat, Gardelegen, in a not very prosperous agricultural region.</p>
                <p>My parents, as physicians, were respected citizens (there were, I think, five or
                    six other doctors in the town or in the area). They had started in their
                    practice at the time of the great inflation in Germany. Everybody was
                    struggling; but by the time I was born, I'm told (I obviously don't recall it),
                    things were really looking up in terms of their life and their lifestyle. They
                    weren't ever interested in great luxuries or extravagances. In any event, when I
                    became aware of my surroundings, at age three or four, we lived in a
                    nicely-furnished house. On the ground floor, my parents had their medical
                    offices; and upstairs, we had quite a large apartment; and that's where I spent
                    my childhood.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Sonnenfeldts? What are their German roots, and how long were
                    they?</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: On the Sonnenfeldt side, my father was born in Berlin. My
                    grandfather on my father's side had been born in what was called West Prussia,
                    which once had been, and later again became part of Poland (in 1919, when it was
                    restored to Poland after the First World War). It's a little murky before that.
                    It is said in the family that my grandfather's father was a foundling. I don't
                    know anything about the circumstances, except that he was adopted by someone
                    named Sonnenfeldt. So what the precursors were on that side, I don't know.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My grandmother's family came from Breslau, in Silesia (called Wroclaw after World
                    War II), and went back several generations in that area.</p>
                <p>My paternal grandfather had a small clothing-manufacturing place in Berlin. My
                    father and his brother were sent to university, but their two sisters weren't;
                    that wasn't done in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: My father studied medicine, and just before he was completely
                    finished, the First World War broke out. He was drafted into the Imperial Army
                    as a physician and was shifted back and forth between the Western and Eastern
                    Fronts, and won an Iron Cross [German military honor], which is something that
                    figured later in his life. Then, after the war, which he was fortunate to
                    survive, he completed his medical education and started this practice in
                    Gardelegen, west of Berlin - halfway between Berlin and Hannover.</p>
                <p>My mother was an only child. Her father's was the only Jewish family in a
                    smallish town in Schleswig-Holstein in the north of Germany. Her father was very
                    much personally committed to education, and had been well educated, I think
                    partly by himself, in classical Greek and Latin. He insisted that my mother
                    should go to university, which she did in Hamburg. She too studied medicine.
                    Through some complicated connections, she happened to meet my father in Berlin.
                    In Germany, you don't usually stay in one university; you go to several, which
                    is how they met.</p>
                <p>I don't know much about my maternal grandfather's ancestors. But there was in his
                    family a very brilliant physicist, who, if he hadn't been Jewish (although he
                    wasn't a believer), would have been nominated to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society,
                    which was the German version of the Academy of Sciences. I didn't get any of his
                    genes, but my one brother, Richard, did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, he was a physicist, and he was, inter alia, involved in the
                    invention of the Osram light bulb. I can't tell you precisely what his field
                    was; but that was one of the things associated with his name. It earned him the
                    approach to become a member of the German Kaiser Wilhelm Society, provided he
                    converted to Christianity. But, even though he wasn't a believer, he decided he
                    wasn't going to convert. So there was some special distinction on that side of
                    the family. I'm not exactly sure what his antecedents were, but he was obviously
                    a man of great gifts. My brother became quite interested in science and
                    engineering. So I've always said that the genes from that branch of the family
                    came to him rather than to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My grandfather on my mother's side (i.e., her father) headed the only Jewish
                    family in this town of Brunsb�ttelkoog, which is well known in Germany because
                    it's at the place where what was called the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal (now called the
                    Kiel Canal) joins the North Sea. So it was quite a well-known place. Parts of
                    the German battle fleet were moored there in World War I. My mother kept telling
                    us about these huge ships in her childhood. The canal was built so that ships
                    could have a short and direct link between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.</p>
                <p>In any event, my grandmother on my mother's side came from Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
                    I imagine all of them at one time or another, some generations back, had
                    probably come from Poznan or from that part of Poland which had been part of
                    Prussia since the late eighteenth century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you grew up in your family, because it was certainly
                        a major factor in those days, how sort of “Jewish” was your family? I
                        mean-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, they were Jewish. They knew it. My father had been Bar
                    Mitzvah. My mother was an only child, and she did not have a similar ceremony.
                    Coming from Berlin, my father's family knew many Jews, but they weren't
                    particularly observant. I do think in our very small town of Gardelegen, there
                    actually had been a somewhat larger Jewish community in the nineteenth century
                    than when I was growing up. They did have religious services, especially on the
                    high holy days. That continued, I know, into my childhood, because I remember
                    going with my father into a hall that was rented for the purpose of holding
                    services. But it's pretty clear that until Hitler came along in 1933, this was
                    not a major part of their lives. In fact, my mother used to sing in the
                    Christmas Eve choir of one of the Protestant churches in town. But they
                    remembered their Jewish background, as did the few other local Jewish families.
                    In addition to services, we did get some Jewish religious instruction from a
                    rabbi who came by train from another town every week.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>In the German schools, the Prussian schools where we lived, there was required
                    religious instruction. There was, I guess, a class maybe once a week, maybe
                    twice a week, for the children in the school to get instruction in religion.
                    Jewish children, even before Hitler, were not expected to participate. But
                    especially after Hitler came to power, we were not allowed to participate. So
                    the rabbi came, I think every Tuesday afternoon, from a town nearer Berlin where
                    there was a somewhat larger Jewish community. He came down on the train and
                    spent an hour or two with the Jewish children; and that was accepted as meeting
                    the requirement for instruction in religion. We learned prayer book Hebrew and
                    the Old Testament, and so on. Then our family started lighting candles on Friday
                    nights, said prayers, and so on. So some Jewish practices came back. My father
                    remembered them from his father, who had been quite religious. My grandfather
                    was still alive, and he came to see us periodically on weekends, taking the
                    train from Berlin. He would do a much more elaborate Friday night Sabbath
                    service. So we understood that we were Jewish; and if we hadn't done so, some
                    local citizens would have reminded us as discrimination, at first rather mild,
                    became more and more direct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find also in the small town a split between the
                        Protestants and the Catholics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There was a small Catholic community there. The region in which this
                    town is located had been in the midst of the Thirty Years War. Armies fought
                    back and forth, and there were all sorts of folkloric stories about it. There
                    was a residue of a Catholic community; there was a Catholic church. It's still
                    there, and now has about 50 members, the priest told me when I visited there
                    recently. Churches aren't faring all that well, anyway, in Germany; but the
                    major church there remains Lutheran. I guess the Catholics lived okay; but in
                    this region, they were not a major religious group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of home life, I mean, what sort of intellectual
                        life, were you getting from your two parents, both of whom had medical
                        degrees and all? And also, how many brothers, and sisters did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I have one brother who is three years older than I. We went to
                    school in Gardelegen, first to primary school and then to a gymnasium (high
                    school) that you went to after four years of primary school. My brother was of
                    course three grades ahead of me, and while it was still possible, we had friends
                    in our respective age groups. We both had French as our foreign language. We
                    were taught history, mostly German history, and some literature, almost entirely
                    German literature, and geography, mathematics, and so on. At home there
                    was?well, there was not much dinner table discussion because my parents worked
                    very hard. They frequently were out at night because of emergencies; in those
                    days doctors made house calls. There was a hospital in town; but basically, you
                    went there only if you were really deathly ill or you needed an operation. So
                    they had quite busy lives.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>But we had scores of volumes of Goethe and Schiller on the bookshelves. When
                    these works came up in school, we read the plays and poetry, not in simplified
                    fashion. Since we had them all at home, we could talk to our parents about them.
                    They had been raised on German literature as children themselves, and retained a
                    lot of what they learned.</p>
                <p>There was still in those days - let's say the mid-1930s - a lot of reminiscing
                    about the First World War, because my father had been through it. He had some
                    pals in town who had been through the war as well. They would drink beer and
                    play the German card game Skat; but most of that dried up as the Nazis came to
                    dominate the town. But we heard a lot of war stories. It was sort of a general
                    cultural environment. Medicine was medicine, and that wasn't so much for
                    children. I mean, we were told about how babies came into the world pretty early
                    in our lives, and so on; but there wasn't a whole lot of talk about that, even
                    though on many a night, one or the other of our parents was out delivering
                    babies. They usually managed to catch some sleep because there was always a
                    midwife to take over.</p>
                <p>I would say ours wasn't the most brilliant intellectual life, but we were
                    educated people. We talked about whatever came along, and we had a good library,
                    so I leafed through a lot of books. My inclination was toward history, and I
                    started reading what history books there were in my parents' library. They dealt
                    mostly with Germany, very little with anybody else, except for the war books
                    from which I got heavy doses of the German version of events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the impact of the Nazis? I mean you were born
                        in '26. Hitler came into power?well, around '33, didn't he? So you were just
                        starting school about that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I started school in '32. I was quite aware of the election of
                    1932, which was the presidential election. My parents were sort of leaning
                    toward the SPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschland or Social Democratic
                    Party) direction; I don't know whether they ever were registered members of it
                    or not. But that was a crucial election for President, because it was
                    Hindenburg, thGerman military hero, against Hitler. A lot of people who
                    ordinarily wouldn't have voted for Hindenburg did vote for him in order to block
                    Hitler. Hitler, indeed, did lose that election, but he still was on a steady
                    climb. There was quite a bit of political talk at home when people came by. I
                    tried to listen to it as a five-year-old, six-year-old. Our family had in the
                    meantime acquired a radio, so we were able to hear some political speeches. I
                    remember waiting with my parents and brother for the election results on the
                    German radio in this 1932 election. Hindenburg had won.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Then came several more elections in 1932, at lower levels, and then a series of
                    government crises. These led to the designation of Hitler by Hindenburg, after a
                    lot of bargaining which I didn't understand very well as a child. Not much of it
                    was reported in the newspapers, but a lot of the secrets became known
                    afterwards. Hitler was designated as Chancellor. The idea of conservative
                    politicians was to surround him in his Cabinet with respected conservatives who
                    would supposedly block Hitler when necessary. That was obviously a fantasy, and
                    did not usher in a happy time. Indeed, very shortly after that took place, there
                    was a demonstration in our town by brown-uniformed Nazis. There used to be a lot
                    of demonstrations on the first of May, by Communists, Social Democrats, and
                    other groups in observance of this national holiday.</p>
                <p>But on the first of April, 1933, the Nazi demonstration included what was called
                    a boycott. There were two or three Jewishowned stores, and the offices of
                    physicians; and Nazi soldiers, really Nazi troopers, planted themselves in front
                    of the Jewish businesses, and my parents' medical practice. So that was really
                    the first major shock wave, especially in our small town, where everyone knew
                    everyone else. People began to take their distance from us, although some were
                    courageous and stayed in touch.</p>
                <p>Then I remember in that period how the Nazi youth organizatioin uniform and with
                    a fife-and-drum band - kept marching up and down the street, and also kept going
                    out on sort of semi-military hikes, and so on. I didn't quite understand what
                    was going on. I remember asking my mother, “Why can't we do this?” and she
                    explained that we couldn't. There were about eight or ten Jewish children in
                    this town, and she organized a little hiking and bicycling group that went out
                    into the country, so that we would not feel we were totally isolated and out of
                    it. But this group was only the Jewish kids, and there were no uniforms. As time
                    went on, my parents made contact with some Jewish people in nearby Magdeburg,
                    which was a much larger city. (It's now the state capital of that part of
                    Germany.) They became acquainted with some Jewish physicians there, and there
                    was a Jewish lodge that they joined. So we went fairly frequently to Magdeburg,
                    where the Jewish community was much larger, maybe a hundred families with
                    children, with whom we became acquainted.</p>
                <p>In 1934, my parents' medical practice was still quite active. We could still
                    attend the local schools, but not make friends. We could still go to a resort on
                    the Baltic. But we heard of more and more Jewish people who had decided to leave
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>The next major event was in September, 1935, when the Nuremberg laws were
                    proclaimed. These laws basically introduced an ever-growing regime of
                    restrictions on the lives of Jews. One clause, for example, prohibited Jews from
                    employing maids under age 35, on the presumption that the women weren't safe
                    from sexual advances. My parents still managed to bring in an elderly family to
                    help with the housework. The man was a World War I veteran and he refused to be
                    intimidated.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>My parents still saw patients. But after 1935, maybe '36, they were expelled from
                    the German state medical insurance system, so they had to practice privately and
                    charge fees, which was not yet prohibited. Of course, this shrank the size of
                    their practice; but they still saw numerous people they had treated in the past,
                    who stuck with them, even though they now had to pay for treatment. They still
                    went out to the villages and helped people who had illnesses of one sort or
                    another. But all that petered out by 1937, and there just weren't enough Jews in
                    the area to maintain a medical practice. My parents did have some patients who
                    came from other towns in the general region. For a brief period, they set up a
                    kind of clinic for delivering babies of Jewish people, and I think in one or two
                    cases, non-Jewish people who wanted their babies delivered by my parents. So we
                    had some people come in as patients who lived in our house for the time it took
                    to have their babies. Our family's life was steadily transformed and beginning
                    to be uprooted.</p>
                <p>By 1937 it became very difficult for my brother and me to be in school. There
                    were constant anti-Semitic incidents. One teacher, in particular, was a very
                    ambitious guy in the Nazi operations, seeking to promote himself. He was
                    particularly vicious in his remarks in front of the class. So my parents took us
                    out of the school in the town. There was a Jewish gymnasium (high school) in
                    Berlin. We had relatives there on my father's side, and we were sent to live
                    with aunts and uncles so that we could attend this high school in Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, as things kept getting more and more
                        difficult, did you ever hear your parents or any others of the family
                        discuss getting the hell out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There began to be talk about that quite early, actually, because
                    they heard of other people, and even some distant relatives on my father's side
                    (my mother's side was a very small family) who had decided to go off to the U.S.
                    or some place in Europe or Palestine, as it was called then. So yes, it came to
                    be very much a topic by, let's say, 1936-37. My parents got a lot of literature
                    about different countries. The Jewish organizations, which still functioned in
                    Berlin, sent out materials about Latin America or Australia or the United
                    States, Canada, and some European countries. Well, my parents - my father was a
                    German patriot; he'd served in World War I - they couldn't quite believe that
                    this persecution was going to go on forever, but then it became obvious.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>By late 1937, they decided that we had to get out; but it wasn't that easy. So my
                    mother decided to take a trip to the United States. There was a family from our
                    little town which had emigrated to the U.S. in the 1920s. My parents had had
                    some occasional communication with them. My mother contacted them, and they
                    invited her to come to stay with them in Baltimore. She went there in early 1938
                    to look and see what could be done to find work for her and my father. In those
                    days, American immigration laws required that if you came to this country
                    seeking permanent residence, you needed to have someone who would guarantee that
                    you would not become a ward of the state. This involved a $10,000 affidavit that
                    the sponsors committed themselves to. Through the people with whom she was
                    staying, my mother found a Jewish family in Baltimore who had already given
                    several of those affidavits. They were quite wealthy business people in
                    Baltimore, and they did it for our family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this within the Jewish community in Baltimore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. But the search for some employment was not confined to Jewish
                    people. My parents would not be permitted to work as physicians until they
                    passed thMaryland State Board medical exama difficult and long-drawn-out
                    process. But they hoped to make use of their medical experience.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't know how it is today, but there was a rather substantial Jewish
                    community in Baltimore.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There's a very substantial Jewish community today, as there was at
                    that time. It was partly German Jewish and partly Polish-Russian Jewish, rather
                    divided at the time. And yes, there were indeed some wealthy families. In fact,
                    the man who gave my mother this affidavit was named Lansburgh, and was part of
                    the family which owned Lansburgh's department store.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Department store, yes; a major department store in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. But there were branches of it in Baltimore. It was quite a
                    substantial retailing community, but also light clothing manufacture; and there
                    were quite prominent medical people at Johns Hopkins and the University of
                    Maryland.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>So my mother came home to Gardelegen (I can't remember exactly when) in the
                    spring of 1938, after having spent several weeks in Baltimore. She had made job
                    and other arrangements - all of them subject to getting an American visa and a
                    quota number, because immigration to the U.S. was still governed by legislation
                    that involved a quota system for Germans. My parents decided that this was going
                    to take time. They filled out all the forms and got a quota number, which was -
                    I can't remember what the number was, but it was quite a high number - and the
                    visa wouldn't be issued until that quota number was available. I think they were
                    accepted as candidates for a visa, subject to this quota business getting
                    settled. They had all the documentation, which took a lot of comings and goings
                    and correspondence with the States, and frequent contacts with the American
                    consulate in Berlin.</p>
                <p>So my parents decided to get my brother and me out of Germany. Through a cousin
                    of my father's, they made connections with a boarding school in England. The
                    school agreed to give Dick and me scholarships, and my mother accompanied the
                    two of us to the school in September of 1938. Many people urged my mother to
                    stay on in England, because it was clear that conditions for Jews in Germany
                    were becoming even more difficult. But she insisted on returning to Gardelegen
                    to wait with my father for the immigration matters to get settled. They sold
                    their house at an extorted price (for which they later, after the war, got
                    modest compensation) and stayed with another Jewish family in town. But there
                    wasn't much progress in getting their visas for the States. My mother, it turned
                    out, had a medical school classmate in Sweden; so they got in touch with that
                    lady and asked whether they could come to Sweden as visitors, to wait there for
                    their American visas.</p>
                <p>Eventually that connection worked out, but in the meantime, on November 10, the
                    day after the infamous “Kristallnacht,” all adult Jewish males in Gardelegen
                    were ordered to report to the Town Hall. All of them, including my father, were
                    arrested and taken to the Buchenwald concentration camp. My father was held
                    there for only a few weeks when he was suddenly sent home, on condition that he
                    and my mother leave Germany within six months. (It was not until after the war
                    was over, when my brother was the Chief Interpreter for the U.S. prosecution at
                    the Nuremberg war crimes trials, that we found out why my father had been
                    released. In his interrogation of Field Marshal Hermann Goering, the Number Two
                    man in the Nazi, hierarchy, my brother learned that Goering, who had been in
                    charge of the camps for a short period, had ordered that all Jewish prisoners
                    who had served honorably in the German armed forces in World War I should be
                    released and told to get out of Germany within six months. My father was among
                    the lucky prisoners to be let go, since he had served as an Army doctor on both
                    the eastern and western fronts, and had been awarded the Iron Cross.). So my
                    father returned to our hometown. They were able to complete the arrangements to
                    stay for a time in Sweden, and my parents left Gardelegen, I guess, just after
                    the war started in 1939, and went to Sweden.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, my brother Dick and I were in England at a boarding school, the Bunce
                    Court School. It was a very good school which had been started in the 1920s in
                    Germany and in Italy. It was, for those days, a progressive school. It was
                    coeducational (one of I think only two or three coed boarding schools in England
                    at the time), and it combined a really very good academic curriculum with work.
                    I can't remember who invented these kinds of schools, but somebody in the States
                    did, I think. They had the pupils, the children there, do most of the housework.
                    There were grownups to guide things along and in charge, whether it was the
                    kitchen or the laundry or the vegetable gardens or chickens, or the carpentry
                    shop. You were supposed to get a rounded education: we made our own beds and
                    cleaned our own rooms, and so on; so it was the combination of all these things
                    with a demanding academic program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quick question - when you went there, at some point there
                        were these, I'm not sure if I'm getting the name right, but they were called
                        kindertrains?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We went to England before the Kindertransports, which started some
                    months later. And actually, the school got an influx of children from those
                    transports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now explain what these were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I'm not exactly sure who organized the trains, but somebody
                    obviously had to. They brought Jewish children from Germany, and by that time,
                    from German-occupied areas like Czechoslovakia and-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Austria-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And Austria. Also, I believe, some children who had been sent
                    earlier to other parts of Western Europe, because most of the countries later
                    might be attacked and occupied, but where the families were separated, and these
                    transports came to England. I don't know who made the deal with the British
                    government to accept that, because the British were not that open in their own
                    immigration policies. But they did come in large numbers; I forget what the
                    total number was, but it was-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was significant\!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: - a significant number! Our school had 60 students when we started
                    there - which was small, and of course, the premises were not all that large - I
                    think we must have gotten something like 40 or 50, or maybe more, additional
                    children when the first of these transports arrived in 1938-39. I think the
                    Kindertransports may have started in late '38 (I'm not exactly sure). Of course,
                    through this undertaking, there were a large number of children who were saved.
                    Unfortunately, in many instances, they never did see their parents again because
                    the parents had difficulty getting out, although some did get out. But once the
                    war started, in September 1939, it became extremely difficult. There were some
                    people who somehow managed to get out through occupied Poland and, via the
                    Soviet Union, all the way to Asia. Some ended up in Shanghai, and some did get
                    to the U.S., but basically immigration had stopped. There were some that fled to
                    Scandinavia. Before 1940 and the German invasion of Belgium, Luxemburg, Holland,
                    and France, some had gotten to those countries. Many of them got caught up in
                    the German invasion when it was launched in May of 1940. Some stayed in
                    unoccupied France, which, however, wasn't that a safe place either, because
                    Vichy-France collaborated with the Germans on Jewish matters. Some ended up in
                    Spain, Portugal or Italy. The Italian government was Fascist, but was not, at
                    that point, as systematically anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, as the Germans
                    were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you got to your school, that was ?'39 or
                        '38?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I got there in September of 1938. We got there during the week of
                    the Munich crisis.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay. So you'd have been 12 years old.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was just twelve, on September 13. We left home in Germany on the
                    17th because the school year in England started on September 20, 1938. What
                    greeted us when we got to this school out in the farmlands of Kent (in the
                    southeast of England) was children and others shoveling away at building air
                    raid shelters, because of the Munich war scare, which subsided after the Munich
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a young boy interested in history, this is a
                        great time to learn an awful lot about a lot of places, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. Well, by that time I was able to read academic history books. I
                    wasn't able to read English too well, but I learned very quickly. The student
                    body at the school was mixed, with Germans and others as well as English kids.
                    We had very good English instruction. We were expected to speak English. After
                    about six months, I was able to read the newspapers and listen to the BBC
                    (British Broadcasting Corporation), which became an important thing and even
                    more so during the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>They had a famous evening newscast on the BBC. Once you were 13, you were allowed
                    to stay up till 9 o'clock, which was when it came on. Of course, there were no
                    radios, except the headmistress had a “wireless” in her room. My brother was an
                    amateur radio buff. He had managed to find a shop not too far from the school,
                    where he went on his bicycle and got some vacuum tubes and a condenser, and
                    earphones. So he built himself a radio. I guess he also must have found a
                    loudspeaker. So the older boys (he's three years older than I) had this radio in
                    my brother's cubicle where they stayed, and I occasionally sneaked in because I
                    was interested and began to hear about it. But the war, once it started, really
                    was an enormous geography lesson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And lots of other things. In 1940, we were able to listen to
                    Churchill's speeches on the radio. The newspaper the school got was the
                    Manchester Guardian. The Guardian nowadays is not a paper I'm particularly happy
                    with, but it was the great British liberal newspaper in those days. The school's
                    headmistress was sort of Center Left, I guess we'd say now. They also got the
                    New Statesman, which later became much more radical. So I started devouring
                    those papers. I can't say that I understood every word, because they were
                    intended for adult intellectuals, and so on. But I did very soon get keenly
                    interested.</p>
                <p>Then we instituted an overnight news bulletin, which we typed up (hunt and peck)
                    based on the nine o'clock BBC news. Some of us were able to get German
                    newscasts, in German, on the few medium-wave radios of those days, so we were
                    able to throw in some things that the Germans said. We typed up this sheet and
                    hung it on the school's bulletin board, so that anybody who wasn't able to
                    listen to a radio could get some information about what was happening. At the
                    beginning of the war, after Poland was occupied, things seemed to be kind of
                    dull. It wasn't until the Germans went into Norway and Denmark in 1940, and then
                    in May, into France, that the news became more dramatic and also closer to
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, for a while it was called a “sitzkrieg” (warfare
                        marked by a lack of aggression or progress).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right. I personally became keenly interested in anything in
                    the newspaper that showed the British navy, all the ships, different categories
                    of ships, and the German navy, and the French navy, and the Italian navy, and so
                    on. My naval interests never really have subsided. I'm on the CNO (Chief of
                    Naval Operations) Executive Panel; I've been a member for 25 years. So navy
                    interests go back some 60 years.</p>
                <p>Q: I grew up in Annapolis, and I could tell you the tonnage of every ship you
                    could think of.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, terrific! Well, anyway, I graduated from this high school in
                    1942.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh! While you were there, within the neighborhood - here
                        were a bunch of kids who were out of Europe, a lot of them out of Germany.
                        Were the local people sort of looking at you sort of sideways or
                        otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I frankly never encountered it, even when there were fears o“fifth
                    columns” - fears that the Germans had organized to confuse the local population
                    and to block military movements on the roads. This school was located in a rural
                    area and had good relations with its neighbors. It was eventually evacuated
                    because it was too close to the south coast of England. After the fall of France
                    and the general concern about when the German invasion would start, this school
                    was evacuated to the northwest, to another large house in Shropshire, which was
                    also in an agricultural area. We had our own vegetable gardens, both in Kent and
                    in Shropshire. The farms around us had sizable orchards and potato and vegetable
                    fields. In Kent, they also grew hops. Most British adult males had been
                    conscripted; the government made some exceptions when there was only one man who
                    could work the farm, but in many cases their young men were drafted and young
                    women joined the British women's military units. Our neighbors needed hands to
                    work in the fields or to pick the fruits or hops. The Kent hop neighborhood was
                    like that around my hometown in Germany, where there had been breweries since
                    the thirteenth century. In Kent, the breweries were further away from the
                    fields. But anyway, we went out in the afternoons and on weekends to help the
                    local farmers - we're talking about spring, summer, and fall of 1940 - to bring
                    in their harvests. They liked that, and they gave us maybe? I don't recall,
                    maybe a few shillings a day; a pound would have been too much. So we were able
                    to earn some extra pocket money, which was great because the school gave us only
                    one shilling and sixpence a week, so that we could buy some chocolate at the
                    neighborhood store. We really didn't need money, but it was nice to earn a few
                    shillings.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So, back to your question: I at least can't recall encountering suspicion of us
                    as foreigners, even though the population was urged to be very alert to
                    strangers and to Germans dropping down in parachutes. As I mentioned, talk about
                    “fifth columns” had become widespread. So there was quite a bit of that, but it
                    was not directed against us. However, by the time of Dunkirk - the British
                    military evacuation from France, in June of 1940 - the British government
                    introduced new regulations. There was widespread anxiety, almost a panic, about
                    the risks and dangers from foreigners in Britain. One result was that all German
                    males over 16 years of age were interned, irrespective of the circumstances
                    under which they had come to Britain; and that included my brother. I wasn't 16
                    yet in 1940; he was. My brother and several other students in the school,
                    children - they were adolescents - were picked up and interned. You know, we
                    knew something about concentration camps in Germany, and so we weren't exactly
                    sure, and they weren't exactly sure what internment meant. They thought maybe it
                    was temporary. Many people thought it was temporary, but the result was that my
                    brother and I were split up. (Incidentally, my father had been put into
                    Buchenwald concentration camp during the Nazi pogrom in November, 1938. He was
                    released after two weeks because of the Iron Cross he had been awarded in World
                    War I.)</p>
                <p>My brotheDick's life turned into a long, long odyssey. I don't mean to digress
                    too much. He eventually got shipped to Australia, as did many of the internees,
                    and others were sent to Canada. The government wanted to get them out of
                    Britain, although some were kept on the Isle of Man. But he was on a ship to
                    Australia which also carried some of the early German prisoners of war that the
                    British navy had captured, or that had been captured from air battles. It was a
                    rough trip for these Jewish refugees that were on the ship going to Australia;
                    basically, the German prisoners controlled the ship below decks, and they
                    harassed the Jews. Once this became known (after they got to Australia), it
                    became a scandal in the British press; and the British changed their laws and
                    distinguished between enemy and friendly aliens. By the time my brother got to
                    the camp where they were all taken, in the outback in Australia, the commandant
                    there got all these Jewish people assembled and said, “You are all going to be
                    freed, and you are to go back to Sydney and get on a ship back to England so
                    that you can resume your lives; or you can stay in Australia.” A lot of them
                    did. I occasionally hear from some of them who had been at the boarding school
                    in England.</p>
                <p>My brother decided to go back to England. The ship he was on was requisitioned by
                    the British navy several weeks out of Sydney because of a crisis with Japan -
                    this was late 1940, the so-called Burma Road crisis - and Dick and the other
                    returning internees were all dumped ashore in Bombay, India, and told, “You're
                    free now.” My brother found some work there, and also happened to find some
                    German Jews in Bombay who knew my family. He telegraphed my parents, who by then
                    were in Baltimore. They got some money together and he earned some money as an
                    electrician, and eventually he got enough to buy a ticket on a ship to go to the
                    States. He got to the States sometime in late 1941; so he rejoined my parents
                    and resumed his life here. I was still at school in England.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>When I finished my English high school education, somebody found me a job in
                    Manchester, as a laboratory assistant in the physics department at the
                    university. I didn't know a whole lot about physics, but anyway it was an
                    instructive kind of a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Washing test tubes and this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, and they were actually doing some very high-class cosmic ray
                    research, and it involved moving a lot of lead around from one cloud chamber to
                    another cloud chamber. But I began to pick up some scientific knowledge, and I
                    started building primitive radios in my spare time. Anyway, I was in Manchester
                    in this job and I got a little money, and my parents sent a little. By that
                    time, they were not making a huge amount, but they were making enough to help me
                    out. I did take some science courses in the evenings and on weekends, but I
                    wasn't headed toward my family's accomplishments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They'd gotten to Baltimore by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. I should have said that they were in Sweden when their U.S.
                    visa number came up; but by then, the war had started. They traveled to New York
                    on a Swedish-American ship which was originally supposed to have stopped in
                    Southampton, England, on the way to New York; but because of the war, the Swedes
                    observed the war zone; and so they came directly to the States sometime in early
                    1941. And I stayed on in school in England.</p>
                <p>My parents settled in Baltimore and had some jobs, which weren't the greatest.
                    But anyway, they settled. At that time, they worried about what was happening to
                    me. They knew my brother had been interned; but then, eventually, they got his
                    telegram from Bombay. It didn't specify exactly why he was in Bombay, but at
                    least they knew he was all right. They'd scraped together some money and sent
                    him some to help him get passage to the U.S. So he rejoined them in late
                    1941.</p>
                <p>I finished high school at the Bunce Court School in 1942 and, as I mentioned, I
                    went to work in Manchester. I lived there in a hostel organized by the Jewish
                    community in Manchester, which had quite a sizable Jewish community - a
                    Sephardic community, partly Spanish-descended Jews, who also were quite wealthy,
                    as well as other Jews. It was a good set-up. In those days, because of the
                    British conscription, which was widespread, there were jobs to be filled. Some
                    of the hostel members took part-time university courses, as I did, and began
                    what later became their professional life in that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>By 1944, travel by non-VIP (Very Important Person) civilians across the Atlantic
                    was permitted; so I went to London to get a visa to enter the United States. Of
                    course, my parents were residents; and this visa was to join them, and also to
                    become a resident of the United States. Someone helped me to get passage to the
                    U.S., which turned out to be on a 2,500-ton banana boat, very clean, which left
                    from Bristol in early March, 1944. There were maybe 12 staterooms, so there
                    weren't more than about 24, or at most possibly 30 passengers on this little
                    ship. But we got out of Bristol and went through the Irish Sea to somewhere near
                    Belfast. We joined a convoy of about a hundred ships with escorts, even though
                    generally the Atlantic was then considered clear. But the convoy went quite far
                    north and zigzagged; it was a three-week crossing. We were all rather young on
                    this little ship, and so it was fun; it was pleasant. There were rough seas, but
                    we mastered that gradually. One or two of my shipmates are still alive, and I'm
                    still occasionally in touch with them.</p>
                <p>So I got to the States on the first of April 1944, and rejoined my family for the
                    first time since 1938. My parents, by that time, were physicians at a well-known
                    mental hospital in Baltimore, Sheppard Pratt. It was one of the few
                    psychoanalytically-oriented mental hospitals, which my parents were not - they
                    had had quite good psychiatric training and had applied it to some extent in
                    their rural practice in Germany.</p>
                <p>So my initiation to American life was in a mental hospital. I lived with my
                    father and mother in this mental hospital, and found a job in Baltimore with a
                    photographer. In not quite six months I would be 18 years old, and subject to
                    the draft. I also got admitted to a couple of evening school courses at Johns
                    Hopkins University in Baltimore. The chief psychologist at the mental hospital
                    was at Johns Hopkins as a full-time professor, but he did some consulting at
                    Sheppard Pratt. So he helped me get into one course - I think it was sociology -
                    and another which I think it was a philosophy course.</p>
                <p>I got acquainted with people in town, younger people in Baltimore, through my
                    parents or through some of the physicians who had younger siblings or cousins or
                    friends. So I made friends in town and slowly began to change my English accent.
                    I began to drink up American popular culture.</p>
                <p>Actually, when I lived in Manchester, I went to the movies. There were lots of
                    American troops that eventually were stationed there; so practically all the
                    movies were American. (Most movies were American anyway, since the British movie
                    industry pretty much shut down during the war.) They had some very good movies,
                    and so I learned who Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire and other stars were, and I
                    got a little more acquainted with who was what, and what was what in the States.
                    My first job in the U.S., with a commercial photographer, was a very good
                    experience because he had contracts with the Coast Guard in Baltimore; and we
                    used to go out across the port of Baltimore to take progress pictures of the
                    various Coast Guard cutters that were being built there in Baltimore. He had
                    other contracts with the city; he took pictures at schools; he took pictures all
                    around; and so I got around.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>A little later in the year, I learned a bit about American politics during the
                    1944 presidential election campaign between Roosevelt and Dewey. Dewey came to
                    Baltimore and rode down Howard Street in a white convertible to a rally in the
                    Armory. I was out there taking pictures of Dewey as he passed by. My boss at the
                    photography place was an ardent, ardent Republican! He couldn't stand Roosevelt!
                    I just felt deeply offended when he mocked Roosevelt's language and made nasty
                    remarks, because I'd never known of any American president except for Roosevelt.
                    So for me, Roosevelt was the obvious choice. I had nothing in particular against
                    Dewey. Anyway, I still have somewhere in a footlocker at home those pictures I
                    took of Dewemy first experience with a presidential election.</p>
                <p>Then on top of this bit of Americana, Baltimore had a Triple-A baseball team
                    called the Orioles. On the night before the Fourth of July of 1944, their
                    ballpark burnt down. I got a call early in the morning from my boss, who said,
                    “Get down to 29th Street to Oriole Park. It's burning! I want you to go down
                    there and take pictures. I want you to take pictures of the mayor or anybody
                    else who you can find there, and I'll be down there with you.” There was a
                    camera called the Speed Graphic, which had recently been invented. It was
                    relatively small, with a flash lamp. I had one of those on loan from my boss
                    that I could use. I'd taken some pictures of my parents from time to time.</p>
                <p>Anyway, by the time I got down to Oriole Park, I guess they had doused the
                    flames, but it was a great event! The Mayor, Theodore McKeldin, was passing out
                    matchboxes with his picture, and signing autographanother bit of Americanization
                    for me. In addition, the Orioles were in last place at that time. They moved to
                    Memorial Stadium, and I became an Oriole fan, and they won the International
                    League pennant. They went all the way from last place, climbed over Rochester
                    and Buffalo and Jersey City-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, great days!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And then they were in the Little World Series-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Triple-A.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Triple-A League World Series. I can't even remember who they
                    playe(but my wife, who is from Baltimore and was a big Orioles fan at that time,
                    says they beat Louisville to win the pennant). It was the same year that the St.
                    Louis Cardinals and Browns were in the World Series. The Browns later became the
                    Orioles. So anyway, I suddenly became a baseball fan.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>A little later that year, when I was still waiting to get drafted into the army,
                    the football season started; and Navy played most of its games in Baltimore at
                    Memorial Stadium. So I got a rapid introduction into American football and went
                    to many games, including NavyNotre Dame. I think they beat Notre Dame, 56 to 0.
                    They had all different troops and the colleges too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was great years for ArmyNavy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And then the ArmyNavy game was played there in Baltimore that year.
                    That was the year of Blanchard and-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Davis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Doc Blanchard and Glen Davis were the big stars, playing for Army. I
                    was 'way up above one of the end zones and took the pictures of both teams'
                    lines - the Corps of Cadets and the Brigade of Midshipmen - and then took
                    pictures closer to the field of various plays. I didn't know enough football to
                    know exactly when to take the picture, but I have a whole batch of those. So
                    anyway, I learned, and got acquainted a bit with what Americans talked about and
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any difference on this thing? I mean, here
                        you'd gotten a good dose, particularly when you were working in Manchester
                        and all, of how the British were and then the Americans were. Did you see
                        any differences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, the British were at war. Manchester had been pretty badly
                    bombed during the blitz. Fortunately, while I was there it was no longer in the
                    German crosshair, on the German target list. Most of the younger men were gone;
                    some of the women were gone. The parts of the town that had been badly mauled by
                    the German Luftwaffe bombing were slums. The people weren't really terribly well
                    accommodated. But they were cheerful, and actually they were friendly, the ones
                    that knew me. There wasn't any hostility toward us as Germans. While there was
                    sort of an underlying cultural anti-Semitism in Britain, the people I worked
                    with at the university in the lab (including the lab assistants and lab
                    stewards, as they called them, who weren't professional) were very kind and
                    helped me get going there. The public in general was polite and friendly; we
                    queued up for the movies, we queued up at bus stops, we queued up for
                    everything. The people weren't very demonstrative, and I didn't go to the few
                    sports events in town. At the university there was a sort of a makeshift faculty
                    because a lot of people were involved in war work, and so on. But they were
                    friendly. Most of the people that we had more close contact with were Jewish,
                    because it was the Jewish community that had set up the hostel where I lived,
                    and then looked after our welfare. But all in all, I think the guy who sold me
                    my fish-and-chips for lunch near the university where I worked was always very
                    friendly and talked about the war and so on.</p>
                <p>It's hard to make distinctions, because I can't say that I was that close to the
                    population at large. But Manchester had a great public library and a first-class
                    symphony orchestra, several “cinemas” and theaters. I made enough money to get
                    cheap tickets for them. One other memorable thing about Manchester: it had
                    horrendous fogs. All traffic stopped, even bike rides!</p>
                <p>In the States?the war was going on, of course. D-Day, June 6, 1944, was just two
                    months after I came to this country. So the Americans were as much focused on
                    the war as the British were; both clung to the news. But this, I think, really
                    began to boom with D-Day in this country - not that people had ignored the war,
                    and of course, it was going on in Italy and the Pacific. I never encountered
                    (except maybe once or twice when I later was in the U.S. Army) anything like,
                    “Get out of the way, you damn Kraut!” or something like that. There was
                    occasionally a bit of needling, but on the whole, no. You know, people here
                    seemed to be more relaxed. I don't remember whether they had any soccer games in
                    England during the war; they did have cricket, with players beyond draft age.
                    But in this country, you know, football games were a big deal - and baseball
                    games, especially when the Orioles were climbing up the ladder, were a big deal.
                    So people seemed to live mostly normal lives. There was practically no rationing
                    - there was no blackout. There weren't really any constraints. And in England,
                    there was some, but not that I personally noticed. And in England, I didn't
                    drive so I had no problems with “petrol.” Wherever I went, I used a bicycle,
                    even on 40-or-50-mile trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was some rationing in Americ[sugar, gas and
                        shoes]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, nothing of consequence. So the life here in America seemed
                    much more normal and not subject to as many rules and regulations. People drove
                    their cars at night. In Britain, they were allowed to do that, but all they had
                    was a little slit in the headlights, and most didn't have any gas anyway; so
                    very few people drove anymore, at least private people in England. In the States
                    there just seemed to be more hustle and bustle, and people seemed to go about
                    their business. Of course, they showed pictures of their kids who were in the
                    service in their windows, and this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the stars and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: A lot of flags, and there were lots more newspapers than I was used
                    to in England, with banner headlines, and so on. So these are all very
                    superficial observations-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but I mean this is a young man's first impressions.
                        Now, before we go to your time in the military, what about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: A bit more background: my parents were both psychiatrists. My father
                    has written up some of his experiences when he had been picked up by the Nazis
                    and sent to Buchenwald. As I mentioned, he was released because he had served as
                    a doctor in the German Army in World War I, and had been awarded an Iron Cross.
                    His release was due to the intervention of Hermann Goering, who decided that all
                    Jews who had been picked up in November of 1938 who had been in World War I and
                    had won Iron Crosses, that they were to be released and told to get out of
                    Germany within six months (that wasn't a hardship in the sense that they might
                    not want to get out!)</p>
                <p>But my parents had a rough start in the U.S. They couldn't practice medicine in
                    Maryland because they had not passed their state boards [examinations to obtain
                    licenses to practice]. There weren't any state board examinations during the
                    war, and they didn't know that much English. My mother had pretty good English
                    because she was instructed in it in her high school in northern Germany, where
                    they spoke High German as well as Plattdeutsch, which is a German dialect with
                    some similarities to English. My father had studied Greek, Latin and French. In
                    addition to his medical work in the hospital in Baltimore, he took English
                    lessons. Of course, he was totally surrounded by Americans. Unlike many German
                    Jewish people who ended up in New York, where they basically lived among German
                    Jewish refugees, my parents knew only a few German refugees in Baltimore. But
                    they worked almost entirely with American people, so the language was something
                    they just had to absorb. As psychiatrists they had to talk to patients. They
                    used very elaborate family history accounts as a technique of trying to figure
                    out patients' problems. The diagnostic work in those days was, by our current
                    standards, relatively primitive, as were the treatments.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>My parents gradually became quite fluent in English. Then, when the war ended,
                    they did pass their state boards. It was a big struggle, especially for my
                    father. You know, they had to go back to what they had learned in medical
                    school, years earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But they got their licenses. They had a private practice for a
                    while, and then went back to serve on the staff of a large state mental
                    hospital. Unfortunately, both died young, both of them of cancer when they were
                    in their sixties, in 1958.</p>
                <p>So they didn't really have a very pleasant life. But all in all, they had some
                    years in the United States where they did well; and they had no desire to go
                    back to Germany.</p>
                <p>My brother did very well in his life, in his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your brother do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, my brother ended up in the OSS (Office of Strategic Services)
                    after he went in the Army in 1942 or '43. General “Wild Bill” Donovan picked him
                    up, used him as an interpreter, and took him to Nuremberg when the war crimes
                    tribunal was formed. Donovan was the first U.S. representative to get things
                    started; then Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson was appointed by President
                    Roosevelt as the U.S. Prosecutor. My brother became the Chief Interpreter for
                    the American prosecution. So he interrogated G�ering and many top Nazi leaders -
                    really a fantastic experience, less than seven or eight years after he had left
                    Germany as a refugee, to suddenly be thrown in with all these people that
                    brought tragedies to so many people! When he came back from the Army, he went to
                    Johns Hopkins, where he studied electrical engineering. He went to RCA (Radio
                    Corporation of America) after that, and was involved in the invention of color
                    television (for which he holds some 40 patents) and a lot of the computer
                    development that RCA was working on in those days. He had a very successful
                    engineering career. He was dean of Brooklyn Polytechnic for a while.</p>
                <p>He's had really quite an extraordinary career, including the Nuremberg experience
                    and his saga of being sent to Australia! His ship returning from Australia was
                    actually torpedoed by a u-boat, but fortunately, it was only a glancing hit, and
                    the ship went on its way. So he has a big story to tell. A German publisher has
                    published his memoirs in German.</p>
                <p>When I came back from the military, I went back to Johns Hopkins University and
                    then to the State Department. So my parents witnessed most of that, until they
                    both died in 1958. By that time, I had been in the State Department six or seven
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at least they saw both of you well launched.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, they did. By the time they died, my brother had three children,
                    and my wife and I had one daughter, who was a baby. But they did see the
                    grandchildren. So they had at least something that was good in their lives after
                    the trauma of being uprooted and going through all of that. So there we are!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we've come to - you joined the army or were drafted
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both? Okay. [Laughter] And when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I came to the U.S. in April of 1944 to join my family. So I came
                    with, not a visitor's visa, but a?whatever it was called, a resident visa-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Immigrant visa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Immigrant visa, and that made me subject to the draft. So when I
                    reached my 18th birthday, in September of 1944, I registered. I got a draft
                    notice and reported either in December or in early January of 1945, at the
                    Armory in Baltimore. I was given my choice of service. I'd always been a Navy
                    buff, and I really wanted to say Navy, but then I said Army. So anyway, that's
                    how it started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: When I got drafted, I was worried about what it would be like
                    because I hadn't been to American schools. I was not really familiar with lots
                    of things that I would have known had I gone to school in this country. But it
                    all worked out pretty well. I was in the infantry, so the sergeants were
                    sergeants; I'd seen that in movies, and it didn't particularly surprise me. But
                    nobody kicked me around.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>There was one corporal who was in charge of our barracks who somehow, I don't
                    know why - maybe it had nothing to do with my being German or anything else, but
                    he tended to be harsh. He called me in and read me the riot act for this or
                    that, maybe not having my shirt buttoned when I hung it up near my bunk there in
                    the barracks, and so on. But basically, I can't really think of any
                    uncomfortable or nasty episode that I encountered, either before I went in the
                    Army, or when I went in the Army, except what is normal in the Army-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well?[Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Which, you know, isn't a bed of roses!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The next step was getting infantry training at what was then called
                    Camp Blanding, near Jacksonville, Florida. This is also where I got my
                    citizenship, because one of the things that went along with the immigrant visa
                    and serving in the military was to get citizenship around a year after you
                    arrived in the country. So I became an American citizen in the U.S. District
                    Court in March or April of 1945, just about a year after I'd reached the
                    U.S.A.</p>
                <p>I applied to officer training school when I was three-quarters of the way through
                    my basic training in Florida, but I didn't make it. They didn't say why; I don't
                    know to this day why I didn't, but then a lot of people didn't. I was told to
                    apply again. So I applied again and didn't make it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it? You know, I haven't gone through it.
                        I was in the Air Force, but as an enlisted man, anI know the training cadre
                        is?well, it's a different breed of cat. Here you were, coming out of Germany
                        and all. How did they treat you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, they treated me fine. Actually, before I ever went in the
                    Army, an Army intelligence captain stationed in Baltimore came to see me because
                    they thought I had only recently come out of Germany. (Of course, I had spent
                    nearly six years in England.) So they asked me a lot about things that I didn't
                    know about. So I'd had some contact with Army intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I tried ?in fact, my parents helped in talking to him about the area
                    where we had lived, and so on. But when I reported for the draft, I don't know
                    that there was any special treatment that I noticed, from my standpoint.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Entering the Army, of course, meant that I was propelled into the
                    American culture, even more than had happened in the six months or so since I
                    had been in this country-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -and especially living in a mental hospital, where my parents were
                    psychiatrists in Baltimore, I didn't get exactly a typical feel for the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] One might say that it was a pretty good
                        preparation for the military!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. The Army was a new experience. Obviously, I mean it was a new
                    experience for lots of other people, as well; but in some ways, native-born
                    Americans knew a lot more about the sorts of things that you do in the Army.
                    They'd been in camps as kids, many of them, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But personally, I don't think I had any particular problem. We did
                    have a pretty tough basic training course in Florida, initially. The first few
                    weeks were just routine things, but then, you know, field exercises, shooting,
                    and so on. So the adrenaline began to flow. I wasn't always entirely with it
                    because I might not have understood some piece of American slang or something
                    like that; but, you know, I adjusted, and it was fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, this is, of course, early 1945, when we were
                        beginning to run out of infantrymen for our campaign in Germany, towards the
                        end [of the war in Europe].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I got to basic training when the Battle of the Bulge had only
                    just ended. So while that was being fought, I followed the news every day, as I
                    had as a kid in England. It was just one of my habits, which I've carried on to
                    this day. But the question in training was that we weren't sure what was going
                    to happen to us, whether we were going to be replacements in what remained of
                    the European campaign, or whether we were going to be sent to Asia. What
                    happened in my case, and the cases of some of the other people in this
                    particular group of trainees - which incidentally came from all over the country
                    - was that word came down that we would be going to the Pacific theater.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>This would be the first time I had close contact with black people in the same
                    unisomething that was not yet very usual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was sent to advanced jungle infantry training in Alabama, at Camp
                    (now Fort) Rucker. That seemed to confirm that a bunch of us were being trained
                    to be sent out to the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, getting ready for the invasion of Japan,
                        essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. And of course, there was still island-hopping going on in the
                    Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Okinawa and Iwo Jima.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We had jungle training to the extent that there was jungle in
                    Alabama. We seemed to be mostly crawling through wet earth, like they had to in
                    Georgia. But anyway, that seemed to be what was happening there. So I had
                    another two months or so of jungle training, by which time the war in Germany
                    was really drawing to a close.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, it was also during that time that President Roosevelt died. I
                    remember coming in from an all-day march, firing exercises, and so on, and
                    hearing in the evening that he had died. For me that was - well, I guess for
                    everybody - it was a big shock. Nobody had known any other president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I wondered what was going to happen. Nobody knew Truman, or about
                    Truman, at least not in our crowd. So, you know, it was all a little baffling,
                    what was going to happen; and I wasn't exactly a student of the Constitution. At
                    the end of that phase of training, I got home leave, and then reported at some
                    place in, I think, Camp Meade, near Baltimore, to be sent out by troop train to
                    the West Coast and to Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. That was about when, when you -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: This would have been at the end of April or early May of 1945.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the war was still going hot and heavy in the
                        Pacific—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, it was certainly hot and heavy in the Pacific, and there was
                    still fighting in Europe. In fact, as I have since discovered, some of the
                    heaviest fighting in Germany took place around the little town where I had grown
                    up and which my family had left in 19339. That's another story, which I caught
                    up with only much, much later.</p>
                <p>But anyway, the war in Europe was drawing to a close. The Russians were
                    advancing; we were advancing. I can't remember when the meeting [of American and
                    Russian forces] on the Elbe was, but it was probably fairly close to that time,
                    and things were clearly drawing to a close. At the time, there was all this talk
                    about a redoubt that the Nazis were preparing in the southern part of
                    Germany-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bavarian redoubt, yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: ?and Austrian Tyrol. Nobody could tell exactly! In any case, it was
                    made pretty clear, when I finished this advanced infantry training and proudly
                    got my expert infantry badge, that I'd be likely to go off to war to Asia.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Well then, what happened? I mean, you report to Camp Meade and -</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I reported to Camp Meade and got on a troop train, which took,
                    I don't know, five days?a beautiful trip by the time we got past the mid-west
                    and into the mountainous area. That train, maybe they juggled some of the cars
                    around at different places, but it was a pretty slow-moving train. It ended up
                    in Fort Ord, California, which was a staging area for replacements. There were
                    some units starting to be transferred from Europe actually, or starting a little
                    later; but anyway, these were individual replacements. So I was just waiting
                    there at Fort Ord for maybe a week before I got orders, and a bunch of other
                    people got orders, to get on another troop train. It went, I think, maybe to
                    some military establishment in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably Camp Stoneman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It could be, but I was there for just a very brief stop. We just had
                    our duffle bags, and I think a day or so later, we got loaded onto a troop
                    transport.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nobody had talked to you, looked through the records, and
                        said, “Hey, here's a pretty good guy for our occupation forces in
                        Germany?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well?you know?nobody had talked to me about that, although the forms
                    showed my German background. I had asked myself whether I should say something
                    when I first heard that I was going to go out West and to Asia. I just couldn't
                    bring myself to do it, because I figured the war would soon be over in Germany,
                    and I didn't want to look like I was trying to avoid the Pacific war and get
                    over to Germany. As I'll tell you in a moment, I ended up in Germany anyway,
                    after a while. So if the military noticed my German background, they didn't say.
                    It was a time when they were already taking most of the green recruits and
                    getting them ready for what promised to be a quite lengthy war in Asia. Whatever
                    the plans were, I don't know; but nobody mentioned it to me, and I chose not to
                    mention it - my German background - to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I got put on a troop ship, which traveled for?I don't know, at
                    least three weeks maybe, with stops at Eniwetok and a couple of other places.
                    One morning we were anchored in a bay, and it was Leyte, which had been taken by
                    our forces fairly recently. I don't think it was totally occupied yet. But
                    anyway, we were there and waited. You always wait in the Army! Then we took
                    off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leyte being in the Philippines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, I guess it was Leyte Gulf - I can't reconstruct it precisely,
                    but I don't recall signs of a big recent naval battle. Anyway, I ended up in a
                    large tent camp in Quezon City, on the outskirts of Manila. I think it was a
                    sort of suburban Manila, but it was muddy as hell, and practically everything
                    was destroyed. I can't remember exactly when Manila was recaptured by the U.S.
                    [February 1945]; but in any case, it was a pretty soggy neighborhood. So I was
                    driven there by truck from the pier wherever our troop ship landed, in what was
                    left of Manila harbor. I was taken out to this camp and given a bunk in a
                    tent.</p>
                <p>I didn't know what exactly was going to happen until somebody came along and
                    said, “Well, you're an infantryman, but we need you to drive a truck - right
                    now, while you're waiting!” I really hadn't ever learned to drive! It wasn't the
                    sort of thing that happened in Europe, even when one was 18. So I got maybe a
                    half-hour driving lesson. The idea was to off-load the large convoys of trucks
                    carrying various kinds of material from cargo ships in Manila harbor, and take
                    them to some depot and storage dumps, all to back up the eventual invasion of
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I did that for some time, driving a 6-by-6 truck. I didn't get any
                    additional infantry training. I'm not even sure that I carried a weapon. I kept
                    doing that for several weeks. I'm trying to get my dates more or less straight
                    because at some point while I was doing that, the report came over AFN (Armed
                    Forces Network) that a totally new bomb had been dropped on Japan - the atomic
                    bomb. I guess I heard a little bit of Truman's announcement on AFN. Then I guess
                    we got the Stars and Stripes Pacific edition the next day. We're in August,
                    1945, now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I must say, all the troops that I was with figured that this was
                    going to mean the end of the war; and there was a lot of relief among these
                    troops that weren't, obviously, going to be in the first wave of any planned
                    invasion of Japan. In fact, we weren't all that sure exactly where our forces
                    were by that time. I mean, there was Okinawa; there had been this terrible
                    fighting on Iwo Jima, and so on. (Now I've got to be careful to transplant
                    myself back to that time, rather than what I've studied with some care
                    subsequently in connection with the dropping of the atomic bomb.) But anyway, I
                    don't think we had any real idea of where our troops were or any idea when there
                    might be an invasion of Japan's home islands. But everybody figured that that's
                    what was going to happen. Then this bomb came along, and two days later another
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, at Nagasaki.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In Nagasaki, right. I had studied physics in England. I think I
                    mentioned in our earlier installment that I had worked at the University of
                    Manchester (after I had finished high school in England), in the physics
                    department, which had been one of the leading physics departments in England. In
                    fact, Rutherford and his team at Cambridge University, who split the atom - an
                    ingredient of what eventually led to the atomic bomb, among other things - had
                    originally been in Manchester. So I had sort of brushed past quite a great
                    tradition of physics. I tried to figure out from what I read what the atomic
                    bomb was; and all I know is that we saw the mushroom cloud pictures in Stars and
                    Stripes a week or so later. People were pretty sure this was going to be the end
                    of the war, and there was a lot of relief, and certainly I was relieved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask the question in view of later things. Was
                        there a lot of introspection on your part of should we have dropped the bomb
                        and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, no, no. I really can't say that there was. You know, we weren't
                    watching television; we weren't watching newsreels; we were watching still
                    pictures. We saw a huge cloud, and people, and then there was reporting in some
                    articles in Stars and Stripes, because all this was carefully controlled and
                    censored in those days. Whatever occasional bit of AFN radio that we got, it
                    just said that the town, the city was destroyed, and there were huge casualties.
                    So no, I can't say that I had these epochal concerns at that point. I was more
                    concerned about whether this meant the war was won - it was going to be over. I
                    don't recall any great philosophical discussions about it with my
                    colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, with your colleagues, in view of Iwo Jima
                        and Okinawa and the battles there, was there sort of a feeling that any
                        invasion of Japan, the mainland - Kyushu and Honshu - was going to be a
                        pretty nasty campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, yes. There were some veterans around who were back in the
                    Philippines. There was a big R and R (rest and relaxation) area not too far from
                    Manila, at Baguio, where there were veterans who were getting a break from
                    combat. Some of them somehow intermingled with us. We occasionally got a pass to
                    go into Manila itself, and there were USO (United Service Organization) clubs
                    and whatnot. I mean the town was in total ruin. There were some soldiers who had
                    been engaged in fighting all the way up from New Guinea, and they talked about
                    the bloody campaigns. So I think the general sense was that invading Japan was
                    going to be a bloody mess.</p>
                <p>In fact, I remember standing in the chow line one day with my mess kit in our
                    tent camp, and suddenly there was some firing going on. Then word got around
                    that some Japanese had come out of some caves in the nearby hills and had
                    started shooting. Fortunately, they didn't hit the chow line [laughter]. We got
                    an object lesson of tenacious Japanese, or maybe they didn't know that the U.S.
                    had captured the place, or whatever it was. But I think the general assumption
                    was that an invasion of Japan was going to be a pretty bloody mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, what happened was that the war ended. This gets us into
                    September. We heard parts of the surrender ceremonies on the USS Missouri via
                    AFN.</p>
                <p>The point system was soon instituted by the military - the point system being a
                    way of calculating each soldier's time in service so that whoever had served the
                    longest would get home the earliest. Of course, I'd been in the Army for only
                    about six months; so it was clear to me that I was going to be very low on the
                    totem pole as far as getting back home was concerned. I went to see a personnel
                    guy in the unit that I was attached to. I guess he must have been at regiment
                    level, which was way in the stratosphere as far as I was concerned.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He was an enlisted man, a sergeant, I guess. I told him (I'm not
                    quoting directly, but reconstructing), “I have low point score as far as getting
                    home is concerned. I don't know how much of my personnel record you have here,
                    but I am German-born and speak German and know quite a bit about Germany. I know
                    from Stars and Stripes that there's an occupation underway there, and they are
                    short of troops. My brother's over there working on the Prosecution staff at
                    Nuremberg, so he is doing something useful in the occupation. Since I'm going to
                    have at least a year to go before I can possibly even think of being qualified
                    to get out of the Army, isn't there some way you can somehow get me to Germany,
                    so I can do something where I can be useful?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, you know, you're dreaming! This is the Army!”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I know, but my hunch is that they're pulling a lot of troops out
                    of Europe very quickly. I've also read that in the Stars and Stripes. We are
                    going to be occupying the country and having fewer and fewer troops there. I
                    don't know what's going to happen over here, but if we end up occupying Japan, I
                    certainly don't know any Japanese. Or maybe we're just going to stand guard over
                    these huge supplies here, and then I think it's a waste of what I can
                    offer.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I understand what you're saying, but?I'll see what I can do.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, thanks.”</p>
                <p>About ten days later, my name was called out in our tent at seven in the morning,
                    I think, as we had just gotten up and were ready to do our daily chores, which
                    were next to nothing - guard duty, essentially. I think we were still unloading
                    some ships, because it's very hard to turn this process around.</p>
                <p>My name was called out. There was the sergeant, and he said, “Guess what! I sent
                    a telex to a guy that I know in personnel in some higher headquarters, and told
                    him about you; and they said that if I wait a week or two, there's going to be a
                    new re-enlistment program coming out for the military, in order to prevent the
                    military from being totally (whatever the right word is) decimated.”</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Sure enough, about a week later they posted information on the bulletin boards
                    about a program that encouraged people to re-enlist for one, two, and three
                    years. If you enlisted for one year, you'd be sent home, get two weeks' leave,
                    and then would be reassigned to something. If you enlisted for two years, you
                    would be sent home, and would get a month's leave; and three years, I can't
                    remember. So I went to personnel and said, “I see this is up there now. Do you
                    have the forms?”</p>
                <p>They said, “Yes, we're getting them tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>So I filled out the forms and re-enlisted for one year and a month, I guess it
                    was. The orders came near the end of September of 1945 for me to report. In
                    fact, the orders, which were oral first of all, said, “You're to report at pier
                    such and such in Manila at five a.m. tomorrow morning. Get yourself packed, and
                    we'll get you there.” There were some other men who had also chosen this option.
                    “We'll get you guys there in a truck so you can get on a troop ship. You'll get
                    a bunk on a troop ship, or a hammock, or whatever it is. You're going home, and
                    you'll be reassigned when you get to the other side.”</p>
                <p>That's what I did. We had about a two-and-a-half week trip from Manila to Los
                    Angeles. This was one of the early ships, I discovered later, that was racially
                    intermingled, in addition to which there were all these high-point veterans that
                    were on this ship, going back to the States to get out of the Army. They were
                    all getting some kind of bonus. So this ship was one vast crap game!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I didn't have any money. I was going to get a $250 re-enlistment
                    bonus, something like that-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I spent time watching these people, practically rolling dice for
                    their farms, cars, wives - and millions of dollars must have passed on that
                    ship. So I got back to the States and got some piece of paper ordering me to be
                    at Camp Meade, Maryland, in two weeks and three days, or something like
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In the meantime, I got a troop train assignment, and we crossed the country; and
                    I was taken to Camp Meade, which has a spur from the Pennsylvania Railroad.
                    Meade is near Baltimore. My father or mother met me there in their car, and I
                    went home to Sheppard Pratt Hospital, where they still were physicians, for a
                    couple of weeks. Then I had orders to report at Camp Meade two weeks later,
                    which I did. From there, I got orders to report in New York to a troop ship. I
                    guess I took a train that went from Camp Meade up to New York. The ship went
                    over to Le Havre, France, and there was a troop train there. I didn't know where
                    I was going, but I was directed to get on a waiting troop train. It went through
                    France and on to Marburg, Germany, which was the big, central replacement
                    clearing-house for the American zone in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So I got my first glimpse of all the destruction in northern France
                    and Germany, and ended up in Marburg, Germany, where we all got off. I looked
                    around to see what I was supposed to do next, when a guy came up to me and
                    called me by my name. It turned out to be a man who I'd been in basic training
                    with, in Florida. I can't remember his name. But he recognized me, and he said,
                    “Hey! We've been waiting for you! You're going to the CIC (Counter Intelligence
                    Corps).”</p>
                <p>I said, “What's the CIC?” and he said, “that's the Counter Intelligence
                    Corps.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, I don't know anything about intelligence.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yea, well, we'll make a Counter Intelligence Corps guy out of you, a
                    special agent. You have to report to the headquarters of the CIC in Bad Nauheim,
                    and then they'll work out your training, and then you'll get assigned, and you
                    have totally probably ten months here before you'll be due for getting home
                    again.”</p>
                <p>So I went through all of that, reported, and was sent to Oberammergau in Bavaria,
                    which had some months earlier been turned into what was called the European
                    Theater Intelligence School. It was an old “Luftwaffe” (German Air Force) base
                    or something like that. I was to be there for six weeks of training. We're now
                    getting into maybe late November or December of 1945.</p>
                <p>So I got put into some unit; the class was just forming. The first couple of
                    weeks were supposed to be about Germany: the Nazi party and history of it, the
                    different sub-units of it (the Army had manuals for this); and also the general
                    policy of the U.S. about how you try to hunt down people above a certain rank in
                    all these organizations and arrest them for further examination. A lot of these
                    arrests had already happened, because this is six months after the end of the
                    war. I found the classes (there were about 30 people) boring and ill-informed.
                    The manuals were okay, although I obviously knew a lot more than the authors of
                    the manuals.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew a lot of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So I approached a few people there, none of whom I knew. Some
                    German-born people had somehow gotten into this program and into this school. I
                    said, “How would you guys like to sit down in the evening with the manuals, and
                    I'll go through those with you, because I think I know more than these captains
                    or sergeants who are teaching the course?”</p>
                <p>Gradually, I think we put together maybe ten or twelve men, and we sat around in
                    one of the classrooms, and - based on the manual, but also on my own
                    recollections - I just essentially went through all this material. A lot of
                    these men, particularly those who had been born in Germany, had some knowledge
                    of their own. So we had a seminar. One day, a lieutenant came past there, stood
                    in the doorway, and listened. After it was over, he put on a monocle and said,
                    “You, Sonnenfeldt!”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I'm Lieutenant Kraemer, Fritz Kraemer. You have a remarkable gift
                    for teaching! We really ought to have you come to this school and teach.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I?you know?you'll have to fight that out with the headquarters of
                    the Counter Intelligence Corps because they've got me assigned after this is
                    over.”</p>
                <p>Then a day or two or three later, he came back and said, “Well, assignment is
                    assignment, but I want to see more of you because you obviously have something
                    to offer. You're just like a guy that I became very friendly with in the 84th
                    Division when we were still in Louisiana, and then he came over here to Europe,
                    and his name is Henry Kissinger, and I want you to meet him because he is also a
                    very gifted man.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So that's where that connection was made, in late 1945 or early '46.
                    Anyway, that particular training was over after a few weeks. We learned how to
                    investigate people, how to establish informants, how to arrest people, and
                    interrogate, and so on. I think they actually cut the training program short
                    because they needed people in the field because of the rapid demobilization of
                    our forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I went back to Bad Nauheim and was assigned to a sub-region of the
                    CIC in Fulda, right near the Soviet Occupation Zone. It was famous later because
                    of the Fulda Gap [a break in the mountains through which, it was feared, the
                    Soviet Army might attack westward]. So I reported there, and they assigned me as
                    the number-two CIC agent in a county seat, a “Kreis,” Kreis Lauterbach.</p>
                <p>I was to replace a guy who had been in the CIC for much longer (and had been in
                    it already when the fighting was still going on), and he was due to go home. So
                    I got quick on-the-spot training and more about the techniques of operating a
                    CIC office in a place like that. There was a Military Government team there
                    also, a very small team. So I really had several challenging and fascinating
                    months. I was transferred to several county seats during the time that I served
                    there.</p>
                <p>In this early phase of the occupation, we tried to find whatever people in what
                    was called the “automatic arrest” category who were still missing. The term was
                    from the basic occupation directive and referred to individuals above a certain
                    rank in the multiplicity of Nazi organizations. We got instructions from higher
                    headquarters to look for a particular individual whom they had also tracked
                    through intercepting mail and telephone calls, and so forth, who was wanted for
                    some major war crime or other serious offense. So I did Counter Intelligence
                    Corps work.</p>
                <p>But then, by about January or February of 1946, the Cold War had really gotten
                    started, and particularly in the areas bordering the lines between the U.S. Zone
                    and the Soviet Zone. The U.S. Military Government initially had relied very
                    heavily on Communists to help them administer these rural areas, and also to tip
                    them off if there was a hidden Nazi somewhere in the system. I think by maybe
                    January of 1946, we were ordered to be very cautious with Communists and, in
                    fact, where they had formal positions, to dismiss them now because they were
                    likely to be Soviet agents or Soviet spies.</p>
                <p>So my job began to change from being totally focused on “the three Ds”
                    (denazification, democratization, and demilitarization, which were the goals of
                    the early occupation), to include, also, alertness about Soviet agents or Soviet
                    espionage. We actually had liaison with Soviets on the other side of the zonal
                    border because we were transferring a lot of returning POWs (prisoners of war)
                    who wanted to go to their homes in the Eastern [Soviet] Zone, and we were still
                    doing some things more or less cooperatively, such as cracking down on
                    black-marketeering, smuggling, and other crimes. So there was somewhere, up far
                    above me, a team for liaison with the Soviets, and the Soviets also had one
                    across the border.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved at all with the forced repatriation of
                        Polish persons - you know, people who were being sent back to the Soviet

                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, not where I was working. I had no Soviet POWs that had fought
                    with the Germans-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vlasov.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -with the Vlasov people in the counties that I worked in. In my
                    area, there were two problems. One was that we had several DP (displaced
                    persons) camps run by the UNRRA [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
                    Administration]. These camps were used to house and take care of the refugee
                    stream that was still coming from the East, people from all over the place. By
                    and large, the Jewish people who came into these camps - survivors from
                    concentration camps, or survivors (broadly speaking) of the Holocaust; some of
                    them had been underground - wanted to go to Palestine. Whether they were really
                    Zionists or not, I don't knoit's hard to tell. They weren't under our
                    jurisdiction unless they somehow got outside the camp; and that created a
                    problem because they were black-marketeering, they were doing all sorts of
                    prohibited things. That did get into our jurisdiction because we had been taught
                    that black-market rings could also be agent rings, could be ex-Nazi subversive
                    rings; and therefore, we needed to pay special attention to that.</p>
                <p>Now, there was a lot of activity by different Jewish groups from Palestine or
                    from wherever - the Stern Gang, the Haganah, and others. They were trying to
                    recruit people, Jewish people, anywhere, but especially in the UNRRA camps. The
                    UNRRA camps weren't guarded like concentration camps. On the contrary, everybody
                    was trying to be very careful not to replicate that atmosphere, although camp is
                    camp; so it isn't exactly paradise. But the recruiters did manage to get quite a
                    few people by just wandering in there, or acting as refugees themselves, and
                    then getting out of these relatively unguarded places, and trying to get them
                    down to Trieste or some other place, where they could get on a ship and go off
                    to Palestine. I think they were even taking some overland. That was something we
                    were supposed to stop and prevent, on orders from our headquarters, due to the
                    British prohibitions of immigration into their Palestine mandate area.</p>
                <p>So I had some heart-rending encounters with Jewish refugee groups that were
                    picked up by some of our troops and sometimes by German police, and brought to
                    my office; or I went to see them - 10, 20, 30 people - that had been picked up
                    during the night. They had noticed my name, and figured that I was Jewish. They
                    were appealing to my conscience or my solidarity, or my compassion (whatever the
                    right word is) to let them go. And, you know, I had orders to stop them! The
                    upshot of it was that I had to have our Military Police (what little we had left
                    of military people - but I made sure that it wasn't German police) take these
                    Jewish people back to their camps. They may have escaped again later.</p>
                <p>So I had that problem. I think in some instances, there were suicides; I didn't
                    have that, fortunately, but it was a painful dilemma.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Incidentally, as for the German police, they had been screened and re-trained by
                    my predecessors from the CIC and the early Military Government troops. They were
                    mostly local residents, and the population, by and large, respected them. But
                    the people who had recently come to the region had run-ins with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very difficult period then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. Our second problem was quite different: that is, Czechoslovakia
                    had been restored by that time, and the Czechs were expelling the Sudeten
                    Germans. This is still an issue in Germany now. In one of the counties where I
                    was the CIC agent, every two weeks we got 1,800 people who had been expelled
                    from the Sudeten area, and the local Hessian peasants were not exactly
                    hospitable to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The local people didn't want extra mouths to feed; they didn't want
                    people to stay in their houses, and so on. So we had problems getting the locals
                    to accommodate these people. Of course, the Sudetens, were frightened and
                    uneasy. They weren't sure whether they should try to go home or what was going
                    to become of them; they certainly weren't received with hospitality. So that
                    created a lot of friction and tension in the population. Also, we saw a
                    potential feeding ground for whatever residual Nazi groups might still be there
                    to recruit people into an underground movement. So from our standpoint, this was
                    not just a humanitarian issue, but also a security issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Sudeten Deutsche were sort of a breeding ground
                        for at least the right wing, and they later -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Later, they organized. They're still around, and they're still
                    active. This issue drags on and on, because a lot of these immigrant groups or
                    their descendants are in Germany, and they want the so-called Benes Decrees
                    [mandating their expulsion from Czechoslovakia] abolished. And they want to be
                    compensated like other refugees by the Czechs. I think the Czechs have agreed to
                    do some of that, but they don't want to let these people or their descendants
                    come back. Some of the Sudeten Germans want to claim their parents' or
                    grandparents' properties in this rim around the present Czech Republic. So this
                    remains both a domestic German and a Czech-German political issue. At that time,
                    it was essentially humanitarian and potentially a subversion issue. So those
                    were problems that posed dilemmas back in 1946.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's a very complicated world. By 1955, I was a
                        refugee relief officer, and you certainly got a full feel for all these
                        various movements that were happening within, well, Germany and
                        elsewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the “Fragebogen” (questionnaire of the Allied military
                        government used as a basis for denazification) been started at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The large-scale use of the “Fragebogen” came later, and was used by
                    the German authorities as they became increasingly responsible for administering
                    what became the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). I think the first batch of
                    “Fragebogen” were sent out in early 1946, and eventually covered practically the
                    whole German population in the Western occupation zones.</p>
                <p>When I was in Hessen, in 1945-46, we had a denazification program which was
                    essentially administered by the Military Government, but the Military Government
                    was so thin when you got out to the rural areas that my colleagues and I in the
                    CIC around there participated in this effort. Above all, our job was to exclude
                    individuals with active Nazi involvement from positions of authority.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, we picked up people who were of a rank which were required to be
                    picked uthe “automatic arrest” category. We then sent them on through our
                    military channels to internment camps. The “Fragebogen” system was the German
                    denazification system, with the five levels of complicity. It was fully
                    implemented after my time. We basically operated a) on the basis of captured
                    lists of people to be automatically arrested because of their ranks and level of
                    leadership role in the party system and its affiliated organizations; and b) we
                    acted on information tips from whatever source that somebody in our jurisdiction
                    had been a very active Nazi or had been involved in persecution activities.
                    Those people we arrested and put into our chain of command. Sometimes the local
                    German police helped us find these people and get them, but they were in our
                    chain of command during my time there.</p>
                <p>In our zone, we were aiming to have elections for municipal councils and mayors
                    by February or March of 1946. After that, we expected to have Kreis, or county,
                    elections.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Under the system used in most of the German “Laender” (states) that became part
                    of the German Reich in 1871, the county manager, the “Landrat,” for centuries
                    was part of the central administration of the provinces within each “Land.” The
                    Landrat tended to be appointed; but even when they were elected (as they are
                    now), they were also subordinate to what now is the Interior Ministry in the
                    German “Laender.” In 1946, we didn't have that kind of structure because the
                    higher-level administrative structures were not yet in place.</p>
                <p>In any case, we were in the process of starting a bottom-up exercise in
                    democracy. We were, therefore, also authorized to license political parties at
                    the local level. This I think got speeded up because of the installation of the
                    Communist regime in the East. Our effort was to devolve onto the Germans
                    increasing, although still modest levels of authority in local places. So I
                    really spent quite a bit of time preparing for these elections, which happened
                    at the town level while I was there.</p>
                <p>We clearly did our best to keep former Nazi activists out of the lists of people
                    we cleared for political and administrative roles! We used German informants who
                    had helped us with making personnel choices earlier. By mid-1946, we no longer
                    used Communists as informants, because of concern that they would try to place
                    pro-Soviet people into the system.</p>
                <p>We also licensed some relatively simple newspapers so the population could be
                    kept informed about the preparations for elections as well as other news. (In
                    larger towns and cities in the Western zones, dailies, weekly magazines, even
                    illustrated ones, and monthlies gradually appeared, but distribution to rural
                    areas was at best spotty.)</p>
                <p>As I said, these developments in the West were pushed along because the Soviet
                    zone was being</p>
                <p>steadily turned into a Communist-run outpost of the USSR. The Cold War, in other
                    words, was in its early stages. My role, apart from still hunting down fugitive
                    Nazi war criminals and big shots who were traced to our remote farmlands, was to
                    support the effort to devolve modest but increasing levels of authority to
                    qualified Germans via local elections and appointments.</p>
                <p>I can't remember now whether we also did this at the county level by the time I
                    left. But doing it at the town level was both instructive and challenging for
                    me. We also had to re-start the school system. This meant doing something about
                    the textbooks that were totally polluted with Nazi material - even the
                    mathematics textbooks. And we needed teachers who had not been Nazi activists.
                    Fortunately, some teachers had been trained in the 1920s. We also appointed men
                    who had returned from American POW camps.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean you got a lot of that, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, well, we had a lot of informants. Some proved reliable, others
                    less so. And some who had Communist backgrounds or affiliations were helpful at
                    first, but as I already noted, later on were suspected of being Soviet agents.
                    Also, as you know, the Germans were meticulous document-keepers of official
                    orders. But some of our informants were engaged in vendettas, and our rules
                    indicated that we should use more than one informant when we were clearing
                    someone for a significant job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had the Berlin Document Center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: By the time I got there, a lot of our local documents had been
                    pretty much gone through by the Military Government and my CIC predecessors. But
                    if we had people that seemed to have moved to the area after the war, we had to
                    go through the Berlin Document Center - for example, if we got some tip or the
                    mail-intercept system produced something suggestive that there was another story
                    from the one the person was telling us. When we started the school system, we
                    were looking for teachers.</p>
                <p>Some came forward and said that they were teachers. They had documents showing
                    that they were trained teachers. But then our informants sometimes said, “That
                    guy was really one of the most poisonous Nazis.” We had to judge whether some of
                    these charges were the result of old feuds, and make judgments regarding their
                    validity.</p>
                <p>You know, there was quite a bit of that. In a rural place - I had maybe 70,000 or
                    80,000 people in the first county where I was assigned - to get things started,
                    to get food supplies into the towns and also to other places that had in the
                    past relied on food supplies from the region, to get schools started, to get a
                    hospital started, to get physicians that were qualified, nurses that were
                    qualified, and then the mayor's office, the local police, and then the county
                    system - it was a fascinating experience, I think, at the worm's-eye level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I want to mention one other aspect of this, which wasn't part of my
                    official role. My brother, Richard Sonnenfeldt, whom I've mentioned, had been in
                    the OSS (Office of Strategic Services). He's three years older than I, had
                    participated in the invasions of Italy and southern France, and then had been
                    picked up by General Bill Donovan, the head of the OSS. Once they got into
                    Germany, Donovan wanted an interpreter and someone knowledgeable about German
                    psychology and history. He somehow found my brother; so my brother joined the
                    OSS and remained with Donovan through the end of the war.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the end of the war, the decision was made to set up the
                    international war crimes trial in Nuremberg. Donovan, as head of the OSS, was
                    asked by President Roosevelt, I guess, to do the preliminary work on the
                    prosecution and on the indictments. Since this was an international agreement,
                    it involved the four occupying powers (the U.S. Great Britain, France and the
                    USSR). My brother stayed on with Donovan and went with him to Nuremberg. He then
                    stayed on when Justice Robert Jackson and his people came, to prepare and
                    conduct the trials. At first, my brother was mostly an interpreter, but he then
                    became one of the principal interrogators. He interrogated most of the Nazi
                    leaders there that had been assigned to the U.S. to prosecute.</p>
                <p>So I was in Hessen, and he was down in Nuremberg in Bavaria. Maybe every other
                    weekend, I went down there from Fulda by jeep, and later I became senior enough
                    to get somebody to fly me down in a Piper Cub, to see him. You know, we hadn't
                    really seen each other at all since he was interned in England in 1940. I'd seen
                    him only once or twice, briefly, in the States after I got there in 1944. So I
                    went down to Nuremberg and spent two or three days with him and saw the trial at
                    work. He took me into some of his interrogations of Nazi leaders and witnesses.
                    Of course, that was fascinating in itself. For me it meant seeing, on the one
                    hand, the fate of the Nazi leadership unfold, and on the other hand, the
                    beginning of the process of reconstruction and rebuilding of Germany, at the
                    grass roots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel? I mean, considering your background,
                        having fled from Germany under Hitler and coming back there, was it hard to
                        make the adjustment, or to operate as an American and not as -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I've been asked this frequently. In June of 2000, I was back in my
                    hometown, Gardelegen, with my wife and some of our children and grandchildren. I
                    met with a high school graduating class, and I was asked how I felt - whether I
                    had a sense of revenge, or what emotions I felt.</p>
                <p>I have to say, in 1945, I felt that I was coming to Germany as an American
                    soldier, although I had only recently become an American citizen myself! I felt
                    that I was coming as an American soldier, and that I had a job to do! I really
                    was not trying to “get” anybody. Now, of course, my CIC assignments were not in
                    the part of Germany where my family had lived.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I was stationed in a different part of the country. But still, I wasn't there to
                    try to get revenge against anybody. I wanted to implement the instructions we
                    had. If somebody said, “This guy is an SS man,” and we picked him up, I
                    interrogated him. I wasn't bullying him; I wasn't whipping him; I wasn't trying
                    to pin something on him. I wanted to prepare my required interrogation
                    investigative report and send it up the line so this guy could be dealt
                    with.</p>
                <p>No, I wasn't happy as a clam coming home to Germany at all. The duties made it
                    very clear in what role I was there. But I honestly can say, I really didn't
                    feel a sense of revenge. And of course, this applies also to my later dealings
                    with Germans when I was serving in the State Department and the National
                    Security Council. I did feel, obviously, that the Germans had to be treated with
                    great care because of their history and background.</p>
                <p>You know, I basically tried to do my work. I was interested in re-starting the
                    schools, for example: getting rid of the Nazi materials where we could, and if
                    necessary, just getting some very preliminary text materials for the schools,
                    and getting the Nazi biases (”bias” is putting it mildly) out of the history
                    books or the geography books. We printed some texts on the old-fashioned
                    machines that we had-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mimeograph machines, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Mimeograph machines. I didn't want to see any Nazi writings in the
                    schools. If I came across things, or people tried to sneak something past me
                    that wasn't exactly Nazi but was full of German grievances (going back to World
                    War I, “encirclement,” and all that), I said, “We start from scratch.” But
                    vis-�-vis individuals, I think I did what I was instructed to do, and that was
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Germany when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Before we end this conversation about my time in the Army in
                    Germany, I want to note that I also remained in touch with Fritz Kraemer, whom I
                    had met in Oberammergau. As the time drew near for my finishing the CIC
                    assignment and leaving the Army, I talked to him on the telephone. I told him
                    that I was getting ready to go home and resume university.</p>
                <p>He said, “No, you can't do that! It's your duty to come down here to Oberammergau
                    and teach here; you're so gifted; and in the meantime, we are a big center for
                    information. You should be demobilized here in Germany and become a
                    civilian.”</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, why don't you see what you can do.” As plans stood, I actually
                    would be getting back to the U.S. a few weeks too late to get into the academic
                    year starting in September of 1946. The universities, Johns Hopkins in my case,
                    were so overcrowded with veterans that they couldn't take people in mid-term. I
                    would have had to wait about nine months before I could go into the next
                    academic year. So I was open to the suggestion of going down to
                    Oberammergau.</p>
                <p>Kraemer called me back after about a week and said, in his heavy German accent,
                    “The bureaucracy 'ist schrecklich.' [Bureaucracy is just terrible!] You're in
                    the Army, and I tried everything, but you don't have a college degree, and they
                    can't give you a civilian appointment without a college degree to teach at this
                    school, and so on. So, you'd better go home, and we'll stay in touch,” as we
                    did, eventually, when he got back to the U.S. in 1948.</p>
                <p>I think I left Germany in September or early October of 1946. I was demobilized
                    practically as soon as I got back to, again, Camp Meade. By that time, Meade had
                    stopped being a replacement center; it was a demobilization center.</p>
                <p>Through a variety of circumstances (since it was too late to get back into a
                    full-time university program), I managed to find a job in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, we'll pick this up, getting a job in the
                        State Department, and something about Kraemer, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is September 25, 2000. Hal, let's start. In the first place, you want to
                    talk a little about Kraemer's background because he is an important figure in
                    sort of helping form the diplomatic establishment later? I mean his background,
                    and did you meet with Kissinger briefly at that time?</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I saw Kissinger in Oberammergau a few times, and then he also
                    came back to the U.S. and was demobilized. It's kind of a funny story that's
                    been mentioned many times. Henry had attended CCNY (City College of New York)
                    before he went into the military. Fritz Kraemer - this German-born officer, not
                    quite an aristocrat, who had served with Henry in the same Division, and
                    considered him a person of great promise - Kraemer told Henry, “Gentlemen don't
                    go to CCNY.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kissinger had, I think, been majoring in accounting. And Kraemer
                    says, “Gentlemen don't become accountants. You are a budding statesman.” So
                    Henry ended up at Harvard, and I ended up at Johns Hopkins. And we stayed in
                    touch, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Now, what about Kraemer and his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I've forgotten some of the details. Kraemer was an American
                    citizen of German birth. I think he was born in 1908 [he died in 2003], and had
                    a German education. His father, as I understood it, was either a civil servant
                    or maybe in the military in World War I, and ended up being one of the governors
                    (or whatever the precise title was) in the Baltic states before they became
                    independent of Russia. (They were occupied by the Germans at the end of World
                    War I.) I gather he was a pretty strict and autocratic governor. In any event,
                    this is just to show the German nationalist milieu from which Kraemer came. I
                    think Kraemer studied law at German universities. In the 1920s or in the early
                    '30s, he went to Geneva, where international lawyers had a haven of sorts
                    because of all the international agencies </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The League of Nations forming and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. I don't know exactly where in the League of Nations he worked,
                    but I believe he had a degree from the university there, and he wrote scholarly
                    articles. I guess he went back and forth to Germany, but he was very unhappy
                    when Hitler came to power in 1933. From the standpoint of a German nationalist,
                    a Prussian nationalist, Hitler was a radical, extreme figure - not to mention
                    that he was an Austrian. So I think Kraemer was unhappy about Hitler from the
                    start, in a general way, and more explicitly as time went on, as the nature of
                    the Nazi regime became more obvious.</p>
                <p>Sometime in the late 1930s, he came to the United States, not as a refugee
                    (because I don't know that he would have qualified), but perhaps on some sort of
                    academic visa. I think he continued to work in international legal matters,
                    perhaps at Columbia in New York City. His father, I guess, had died; his mother
                    was in Germany at the modest estate that they owned in the Rhineland. Meanwhile,
                    Kraemer had married a Swedish woman slightly older than himself. They had a son
                    who stayed with his mother in Germany at that time.</p>
                <p>In any event, Kraemer became an American citizen and joined the U.S. Army quite
                    early - maybe he became a citizen as a result of that. But he joined the Army as
                    an enlisted man, maybe in 1941 or '42. He was by that time almost 35 years old,
                    which was nearly beyond the draft age. He went through training and was assigned
                    to a division that was forming (I think it was the 84th Division) and was, I
                    think, involved in the famous Louisiana Maneuvers-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -where they didn't have any equipment, and used fake, papier-m�ch�,

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Then, of course, the U.S. got into the war. Kraemer came to the
                    attention of the commanding general of this division because of his German
                    background and because of his wide knowledge and his very energetic manner: loud
                    voice, vigorous, great physique. I'm not exactly sure when - maybe 1942 or '43 -
                    Henry Kissinger ended up in that division also. That's where Kraemer noticed him
                    and was impressed by his talent, and where Kraemer told Henry about what he
                    should do after the war. (I mentioned in our earlier tape that Kraemer said
                    “Gentlemen don't go to CCNY, and gentlemen don't become accountants.”)</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I really don't know, but Kraemer noticed him. I guess Kraemer also,
                    at some point, brought him to the attention of General Bowling, who much later
                    became G2, IntelligencDeputy Chief of Staff of the Army, after the war.</p>
                <p>Anyway, both Kraemer and Kissinger went to Europe when that division was sent,
                    and went through the remainder of the war. I think Henry was assigned to
                    interrogating prisoners. I guess he had been up in the front lines and captured
                    a number of Germans, but there was a big interrogation project underway during
                    the war. Kraemer got a battlefield commission of some kinhe was a lieutenant
                    when I met him. He and Kissinger became friendly. Kissinger ended up in the
                    Counter Intelligence Corps (I'm not exactly sure how he got to that from
                    prisoner interrogation). He was put in charge as a special agent of the CIC in
                    what later became the state of Hessen, near Wiesbaden (which is the capital of
                    Hessen). But he kept in touch with Kraemer, who in the meantime had been
                    assigned to the intelligence school at Oberammergau. Kraemer set up the library
                    there, and made himself a kind of a general encyclopedia and factotum for all
                    sorts of American officers in the European theater - generals, colonels, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>As I mentioned before, that's where I ended up meeting Kraemer, after I was
                    transferred from the Pacific to Europe after the end of the war in the Far East.
                    I ended up taking some courses there because I'd been assigned to the Counter
                    Intelligence Corps. I thought the classes were inadequate insofar as they
                    concerned recent German history and what the function of the CIC was - in trying
                    to weed out Nazis and not get people with a Nazi past appointed to local German
                    jobs, and also looking for whatever people above a certain rank were still on
                    our lists as missing and requiring to be arrested for purposes of interrogation,
                    and in some cases, because there were accusations against them.</p>
                <p>Kraemer had noticed me at this school because I had started some impromptu
                    tutorials on the Nazi party, its history and organizations; and we became
                    friendly at that time. I think I mentioned in our previous conversation that
                    Kraemer wanted me to become a teacher at this European Theater Intelligence
                    School because he thought I could do more useful things there in training
                    newcomers who were not that well acquainted with German affairs. It wasn't
                    possible for me to do that because I had already been assigned to a county in
                    Hessen. Our troops were on their way out, and our ranks were thin. I qualified
                    for the post by language and background and getting through intelligence school
                    in Oberammergau.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to the northeastern part of Hessen. I met Henry Kissinger maybe
                    once, briefly, at Oberammergau when I was still there in the school; and then
                    maybe a few more times when I visited there. I can't remember when Henry
                    returned to the States, probably sometime in late 1945 or early '46.</p>
                <p>Then, as I said, beginning in early 1946, U.S. forces began to shift focus, not
                    away from the continuing German functions we had, but toward Communists and
                    Soviets. Things became dicier and dicier in our general relations with the
                    Soviets, but also more specifically on German issues. I was assigned to an area
                    of Hessen that was right up against the Soviet Occupation Zone. So what military
                    we had left there were more alert about who was coming across from the East.
                    Until that time, we had relied on Communists to tell us who the bad Nazis were.
                    I think in some instances these Communists had come back from hiding or from
                    concentration camps, and they were given some interim jobs in the local German
                    administration that we and the Military Government people were starting to set
                    up. That practice was gradually discontinued because it was assumed that they
                    were working with and for the Soviets.</p>
                <p>Then Kraemer wanted once more to try to get me, after I was discharged from the
                    Army, to be assigned as a civilian to the Oberammergau Intelligence School. But
                    the administrative people there said that, because I didn't have a college
                    degree, they couldn't really pay me what I should be getting in that job. That
                    would have been more than I made as a special agent of the CIC; but anyway, it
                    just didn't seem to work out. I left Germany in the early fall of 1946, and I
                    was demobilized very soon after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and then you went to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, it was too late for me to enroll at Johns Hopkins, because the
                    university was filled with returning veterans studying under the GI Bill of
                    Rights. They really couldn't take people after the academic year had started; so
                    I had basically a year to wait before I could get in there.</p>
                <p>My brother, who was still on the American Prosecution staff at Nuremberg, knew a
                    couple of State Department people who were associated with the U.S. Prosecution
                    at the war crimes trial. I went to see one of them (I'm sorry I can't remember
                    his name), in the old State Department building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Old Executive Building, I think it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. In those days, it was called the State-War-Navy Building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes [laughter], it shows you -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In fact, General Pershing [commander of U.S. forces in World War I)
                    still had an office there.</p>
                <p>So I went to see this fellow. He said he wasn't sure what job he could find for
                    me for just a year, but he'd look. Then a few weeks later, I got a letter from
                    somebody offering me a job as a mail clerk and translator in a division of the
                    State Department called by the inimitable name, the Division of Foreign Activity
                    Correlation (FC). It was a division that was partly an offshoot of a part of the
                    OSS. It picked up many loose ends from the war and its aftermath.</p>
                <p>In fact, there's one man here at The Brookings Institution in Washington who was
                    in that division at the time (now this is 54 years ago): Brad Patterson, who has
                    just published a book. He later became Cabinet Secretary in the Eisenhower
                    administration and has written books about how the government runs or is
                    supposed to run.</p>
                <p>So I got a job as a clerk in FC with a civil service grade of CAF-3 (Clerical,
                    Administrative, and Finance-Civil Service employees designation), GS-3 (General
                    Schedule). It paid $1,800 a year, later raised to $2,10at that time, the most
                    that I had ever earned.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I got my little desk in the mailroom, and they got lots of mail from all over the
                    place. There was a woman there and maybe a little team that was scanning German
                    diplomatic documents that had been either captured or had been turned over to
                    the U.S. from German embassies in Latin America, from countries that had been at
                    war with Germany. I think Brazil was one, and they got all the documents and
                    files of the German embassy in Rio de Janeiro. We got stacks and stacks of
                    papers.</p>
                <p>In addition to sorting mail and getting it distributed to the various parts of
                    this division, they had me translate captured German diplomatic documents,
                    mostly for the purpose of identifying names of German officials whom our
                    investigators wanted to interrogate. I started reading these German documents.
                    Actually, I was much more interested in their contents because they contained
                    German reports on attitudes in Brazil, rumors about what the Americans were
                    doing, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might just for the reader note that during World War II,
                        the State Department and the FBI concentrated heavily on Latin America, and
                        the Germans were trying to stir things up to no particular avail. But it was
                        sort of the only playground that the State Department had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Also of interest to me: Eleanor Dulles [a State Department officer,
                    whose brother John Foster Dulles later became Secretary of State] had a desk in
                    that division, and had a considerable role in our German occupation policy
                    development. Since I had only just returned from my own hands-own experience in
                    Hessen, I occasionally put in my thoughts. Relations with the Soviets were
                    increasingly difficult, and Secretary of State James Byrnes had recently
                    delivered his famous Stuttgart speech in which, inter alia, he announced the
                    termination of reparations shipments by the Germans from the American Zone of
                    occupation. I made an effort from my modest vantage point in FC (at 505 - 22nd
                    Street, NW) to get word to our people in Frankfurt to include the small
                    industries in the rural counties where I had done my CIC stint among the early
                    ones to be taken off the reparations lists.</p>
                <p>I spent not quite a year in that office. So at least I got a whiff of the State
                    Department, and saw names that later became famous. I was actually there in the
                    summer of 1947 when [Secretary of State] George Marshall made his Harvard
                    speech, in which he announced the American aid program which came to be known as
                    the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>I had no connection with Secretary Marshall because I was about 17 layers down,
                    but at least I felt like I was in an organization that was very important; and
                    then, of course, it was in the Truman administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I commuted from Baltimore by train, because my parents had settled in Baltimore
                    and were practicing medicine there. I lived with them, really the first time I
                    had ever stayed with my parents since 1938, when I left them in Germany (except
                    for the few months from the time I arrived in this country until I went into the
                    Army). And then I left the State Department and went to college in the fall of
                    1947, at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Johns Hopkins, did you have a target in
                        mind of what you wanted to do, and could you talk about your courses at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. When I finished high school, or the equivalent of high school
                    in England, I got a job; this was when I was 16. I got the “school certificate”,
                    which was the final examination to graduate from high school in England in those
                    days. It's got a different name now. Somebody from the boarding school that I
                    attended knew someone in Manchester, England; and they knew somebody in the
                    university at Manchester, and so I got a job there in the physics department as
                    a laboratory assistant. It had been a very famous physics department because
                    Rutherford and his team started in Manchester and moved to Cambridge, and split
                    the atom.</p>
                <p>But Manchester retained a great tradition in physics, going back to the previous
                    century. My only problem was that I had had no physics courses at all in my high
                    school. I had some chemistry. They wanted me to do fairly menial things, but it
                    was a job. I think I got one pound per week; my parents by that time were able
                    to send me maybe four pounds a month. This was $16 or $17 in those days. For a
                    month or so, I stayed at a hostel in Manchester. I saw these young physicists
                    working there at the university who were exempted from military service because
                    they were doing some war-related work, and I got interested in physics. I
                    started taking an evening course and a weekend course in Manchester, in physics
                    and advanced math, for almost the two years that I was there.</p>
                <p>As I came across the Atlantic in 1944 to rejoin my family for the first time
                    since 1938, I began to wonder whether I would ever make a great scientist. I was
                    interested, but I had not really shone in the evening courses I took in
                    Manchester, and I began to question that. On the troop ship going over to the
                    Philippines, I took an Army correspondence course in integral calculus, and that
                    kind of fascinated me, but I wasn't being creative.</p>
                <p>So I was thinking about this more and more - especially after my Counter
                    Intelligence Corps experience in Germany, my involvement in setting up the first
                    local administrations and the first elections, with the Soviets right next door.
                    And I decided that I should change from physics to modern history and political
                    science. That's what I majored in at Johns Hopkins, but I didn't know what I was
                    going to do with that at that particular time.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>A man named Mose Harvey, who was teaching the general history course (which was
                    required at Johns Hopkins), worked at the State Department (in those days, State
                    Department officials were permitted to teach). He held a fairly senior job at
                    State, and came over to Baltimore twice a week to lecture on modern history. He
                    never got beyond the French Revolution, but I started talking to him a bit. I
                    was very much interested in history; I always had been, even during my interlude
                    of physics, calculus, and so on. I started talking to Dr. Harvey, and I'd talked
                    to other people there at Johns Hopkins about things that they were interested in
                    and I was interested in. Actually, my English education had been so good that I
                    managed to get through my whole Hopkins curriculum in three years rather than
                    four. I'd had a lot of history in England, and I had a language, German, and I
                    also had French; so I was able to get through in three years. At that point, in
                    1950, I stayed at Hopkins to take a Master's degree in political science. I
                    wrote about the new German constitution and the federal system under the Basic
                    Law of the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the post-World War II constitution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, the one that was worked out in the Parliamentary Council in
                    1948 under general guidance, but not specific intrusion, of the occupying powers
                    - including the U.S. - and was proclaimed in May of 1949, at which time I was
                    still at Johns Hopkins. In September 1949, the Germans held their first national
                    elections for parliament, and then the new Bundestag elected Konrad Adenauer, by
                    one vote, as the first Chancellor.</p>
                <p>After I graduated in 1950, I spent some time during that summer in Paris at a
                    course run by the Carnegie Endowment, covering developments in Europe and what
                    had just become the proposal for the Coal and Steel Community. Then I went on to
                    Germany to stay with some friends of my parents, who had survived the war in
                    Cologne. That was near Bonn, so I went to Bonn a few times. The Germans were
                    just putting together their government. Adenauer had started as Chancellor, with
                    a Cabinet, and somebody I knew was a friend of one of Adenauer's assistants. I
                    went to see him, and told him that I wanted to write a Master's thesis. He spoke
                    English; I guess he had been educated in the States or in England. I thought I
                    wanted to write about the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament.
                    By that time the German government, including the Bundesrat, had been in
                    existence for exactly one year, in the neFederal Republic, working under the
                    Bonn Basic Law (Constitution).</p>
                <p>I came back home to write my thesis and get the Master's. Hopkins didn't think
                    much of Master's degrees. They thought people should get Ph.D.s (Doctor of
                    Philosophy), and they regarded a Master's degree as only an interim step for a
                    Ph.D. But I did that anyway; and I wrote this thesis on the German upper house,
                    its history, comparisons to the U.S. Senate (which is quite a different
                    institution), and so on. The Bundesrat is to this day a very important
                    institution. So I had become a political scientist. But I continued to be
                    interested in history.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Then came SAIS (the School of Advanced International Studies, in Washington, DC).
                    SAIS had been an independent school founded in about 1944 for training people
                    who would go to work in international fields, including the Foreign Service. One
                    of the founders, Paul Nitze, is still alive. Christian Herter (later Secretary
                    of State), also was involved. I decided to go there during the summer in 1951,
                    after I got my Master's degree. Incidentally, the Korean War had started, and
                    there was some question whether I might get drafted again because I was still
                    only 25.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I came over here to Washington and decided that, the way things were
                    going, I'd better do an intensive course in Russian, which I did. Then I took
                    some courses that concentrated mostly on Soviet domestic affairs, Soviet foreign
                    policy, and international communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is at SAIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: At SAIS. At that time, it was located on Florida Avenue, in a
                    building that had formerly been used as a girls' school. And, lo and behold, the
                    guy who taught the course on Soviet foreign policy was the same fellow who had
                    taught the history course in Baltimore, Mose Harvey.</p>
                <p>I think Mose came from Georgia; he was educated at Emory University and had been
                    involved with Lend-Lease during World War II. He ended up in the State
                    Department, but also served as an adjunct professor in the Johns Hopkins'
                    history department. By the time I met Mose, he was the head of the Division of
                    Research for the Soviet Union (DRS) in what was then called the “R” (Research)
                    Area - the precursor of “INR” (Bureau of Intelligence and Research). A man named
                    Park Armstrong was the head of R at that time.</p>
                <p>Like the FC division in which I had served, R was also an offshoot from the OSS
                    analysis section that had been located in an apartment house on 23rd Street, in
                    Washington. INR, R Area, and the State Department got part of OSS, and the CIA
                    (Central Intelligence Agency) got other parts of it, including the covert work
                    that the OSS did.</p>
                <p>So I really beavered away at Russian language over the summer, hours and hours
                    and hours of it, and began to get some degree of fluency in reading and
                    understanding, less so in speaking.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Harvey taught the course on Soviet foreign policy at SAIS. He was very dogmatic,
                    and I sort of rebelled a bit when I heard him talk about some aspects of the
                    subject. I guess we'd call him a “hawk” in latter-day language; he was something
                    of a contrarian in the State Department and had his disputes with the senior
                    people at State dealing with our policy toward the Soviets. I argued with him in
                    class, sometimes at a very high pitch on his part; I was deferential. But one
                    day after one of these bitter arguments, he waved and asked me to come to the
                    front of the room. He said, “How would you like to come to work with me when the
                    academic year here finishes?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Are you sure? I thought you were angry at me!”</p>
                <p>“No!” he said. “I like people that sound off and disagree.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me an idea of how you saw the thrust of
                        what you were getting, and how you felt about?what were the Soviets after in
                        foreign policy at that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, we'd been through several crises with the Soviets by that
                    time: the Berlin Crisis, the whole division of Germany in a much more rigid
                    fashion than had been envisioned at the Potsdam conference; the Korean war had
                    started; and the Soviets had tested an atomic bomb. (In fact, I was on a student
                    ship going to Europe in June 1950, and I thought we were all going to get called
                    back on account of the Korean war, which we weren't.)</p>
                <p>Mose Harvey was of the strong view that the Korean War was a precursor of an
                    attack in the West, or maybe an effort to divert us from Soviet plans for
                    attack, or use of Communist parties, the peace movement, fifth columns, and so
                    on, to acquire additional satellites. [end of tape]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you were saying that Harvey fit it-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, he fit it all, the attack on Korea, into the Marxist-Leninist
                    ideology and doctrine, and he was steeped in the literature from Das Kapital on
                    through Lenin and Stalin, Central Committee and Party Congress Resolutions.</p>
                <p>My questions at least had to do with just how profoundly the Soviets were really
                    committed to those doctrines, and how much of their behavior, in fact, was that
                    of an ambitious, assertive national power which had won a war. It was a matter
                    of balance, not a question of ignoring Communist dogma and/or doctrines. I can't
                    remember on which particular issues I may have argued with Harvey; but that was,
                    as I recall, one of my questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>There wasn't any silver lining in either one of these views of the behavior of
                    the Soviets. Of course in those days, theories of totalitarianism were very much
                    in vogue. The Soviet system was sort of lumped together with the Nazi system.
                    These different theories developed in the academic world, but also in various
                    studies done for the Congress, and then various authors pursued the ideas.
                    Scholars disputed whether these were different forms of totalitarianism. They
                    would, of course, be put to the Left in this country, or the Center Left, to
                    question whether the Soviet system should be in any way compared with the Nazi
                    system. So there was a lot of pot-boiling in the intellectual community. You
                    know, in 1948 we had a Wallace ticket [Henry A. Wallace ran for President].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Wallace had come to Johns Hopkins. He wasn't permitted to give a
                    campaign speech on the campus; but he gave a talk just off the campus for which
                    he, Henry Wallace, had maybe several hundred people there to listen to his
                    left-wing theories about how to deal with the Soviets. Some of that was echoed
                    in this course that Mose Harvey taught.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Harvey said he'd be very interested in my coming to work at the State
                    Department. He was head of DRS (the Division of Research and Analysis for the
                    Soviet Union and Eastern Europe). It was quite a large division. I said, “Well,
                    I've been in the State Department months before in a very lowly job, and I think
                    I'd be interested in that.” So we went through that academic year of 1951-52. He
                    had somebody send me the forms to fill out, the application Form 57, which asks
                    all the details of one's history. I sent those forms back in July or August of
                    1952.</p>
                <p>When I finished at SAIS, I didn't get a new degree, because I already had a
                    Master's, and I was hoping to do a Ph.D., actually, writing on the Nazi-Soviet
                    Treaty - the Ribbentrop-Molotov Treaty. I'd begun research on it, started to
                    write, and was hoping some day to finish it. It became a very popular topic
                    among historians, so the subject has been dealt with from every conceivable
                    angle by now, or even years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So I first went to work for a translating outfit here in Washington
                    to do Russian translation, just to keep plugging away at that. I translated
                    mostly technical materials that could be bought in stores in Moscow. We had a
                    very active program - our government did, and some universities did - of buying
                    Russian books and journals. The government (the Commerce Department, I think)
                    had some contracts for getting those things translated. So I went with this
                    translating agency to wait and see what would happen to my State Department
                    application. I had a job, at least; I can't remember what the salary was, but it
                    was enough for me to rent a little room and bathroom here in town. My parents
                    were still living near Baltimore, but it just was too much to drive back and
                    forth, and so on; so I decided to live here, at least during the week.</p>
                <p>I kept plugging away with my Russian language. The other translators in that
                    organization had much deeper background in Russian and Soviet history and
                    affairs than I did, and I learned a lot from those people. Then maybe in
                    September or October, I got a notice from the State Department saying that they
                    were actively considering my application. They sent me a long security form.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: By that time, we had the security investigation system in the Truman
                    administration, because of Alger Hiss [a State Department official convicted of
                    spying for the USSR] and all the concerns about Communist spies. I started
                    filling in the form, and sent it back just before the 1952 presidential
                    election. Then I got a notice saying that I had the job in that division! Mose
                    Harvey had plugged for it. I still needed to go through several more procedures,
                    including the medical exam.</p>
                <p>Then the election came, and the question arose, with Eisenhower and the
                    Republicans winning - whether there was going to be a personnel freeze, as there
                    sometimes was in those days when a new administration came in. But Mose Harvey
                    said no; he didn't think that was going to be the case in the R Area in the
                    State Department, because they were all career professionals. There weren't any
                    political appointees (although maybe the INR Director, Park Armstrong, was; I'm
                    not sure).</p>
                <p>Mose said, “go ahead,” and he said they would set a date for me to start at the
                    beginning of a pay period. They set a date in December of 1952; I had nothing to
                    do with it. This was during the transition period between Truman and Eisenhower.
                    I was to be given a GS-7 pay rating. They were hoping to get me a GS-9 because I
                    had two years toward a Ph.D. But in those days, a Master's degree got you a
                    GS-7, and a Bachelor's got you a GS-5. I was going to be paid $4,200 a year.
                    That was absolutely beyond my comprehension!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to put it in context, at that time a salary of
                        $10,000 was considered to be tops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: A GS-15 (top civil service grade) made $10,400.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and that was big money in those days!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. Well, it soon ceased to be big money because of inflation. In
                    any event, if there was a personnel freeze, I didn't hear about it. I reported
                    to work on December 16, 1952. (In fact, I later learned that I was the last
                    State Department employee hired under Secretary of State Dean Acheson; a hiring
                    freeze was imposed shortly after the Eisenhower administration took over.)</p>
                <p>A few days before the inauguration of the new administration, Acheson said
                    farewell to a huge gathering of State Department staff who stood outside at the
                    back steps of the “New State” building. A week or so later, the new Secretary of
                    State, John Foster Dulles, greeted a somewhat smaller crowd in the same setting.
                    His call for “positive loyalty” toward the new administration got mixed
                    reactions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a critical period, because of Senator
                        Joseph McCarthy's attacks on the government, especially the State
                        Department. Since you were dealing with Russian affairs and all, and you had
                        this very unhealthy situation of Senator McCarthy and his minions going
                        around attacking the State Department, did this hit you at all? Or hit your
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, it didn't hit me then, as far as I can tell. But it hit me
                    later, after McCarthy had left the scene. There were people in the State
                    Department Security Office (which, incidentally, was an outgrowth of the
                    Division of Foreign Activity Correlation, FC, wherI had worked in 1946-47) -
                    there were some people, whether they were McCarthy acolytes or not, I don't
                    know; but they suspected Communist penetration at various times.</p>
                <p>Q: This is Scott McLeod, he was the heaviest -</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, he came in with the Republicans as Director of Security at the
                    State Department. And there was a fellow named Otto Otepka who was in Security
                    (SY)-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. There had been a steady leak [from that office],
                        I think, to McCarthy-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Just to jump ahead, I got in trouble because I saw some press
                    people, which was more or less strictly not allowed, at least for junior people.
                    I became friendly with two or three press people in Washington in 1953 or '54.
                    That stirred a lot of concern, I guess, because they noticed it in the Security
                    office; and they kept watching me, and tapping my home phone, and so on. But
                    that came later. I don't think I had any problem along those lines in getting
                    hired, but they investigated me, I assume, as was the practice for new
                    employees.</p>
                <p>I also had a problem that never was cleared up at all, and I only found out about
                    it much later. But it didn't stop me from getting into the State Department, and
                    getting security clearance. When I first arrived in this country in 1944, the
                    Immigration officer at the pier in New York asked me, “Do you intend to stay in
                    this country and become an American citizen?”</p>
                <p>I answered, “Yes, of course. My parents are here. I do intend to become an
                    American citizen, but you know, if there is ever a Jewish state in Palestine, it
                    might interest me, because of what happened to us as Jews. But my present
                    intention, clearly, is to be an American, a good American. I expect to serve in
                    the military.”</p>
                <p>This guy dutifully wrote all this down. It apparently showed up many years later
                    in somebody's review of my files, perhaps for an update of a security clearance.
                    But I was never told; I was never asked to explain this. Then, sometime in 1958,
                    somebody denounced me as an Israeli spy. Why, I have no idea! In any event (I'm
                    jumping way ahead), this seemed to ring a bell somewhere in the State Department
                    Security Office. Somebody had seen a record or a note from the FBI (Federal
                    Bureau of Investigation) when they did my background check - maybe for the CIC,
                    or maybe for when I came to the State Department, although the State Department
                    usually did its own security clearances. So it was McCarthy-era stuff; but it
                    wasn't, as far as I can tell, McCarthy directly attacking me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was an interesting and fascinating period; of course, we'd been
                    through the Alger Hiss trial and other cases involving allegations of
                    pro-Communist activities. There were hearings in Congress for Owen Lattimore (my
                    professor at Hopkins, everybody's professor at Johns Hopkins) led by Senator Pat
                    McCarran, a committee chairman eager to spot a traitor.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>So there was a lot of that going on. But for me, it was a terrific time to get
                    into the Soviet business seriously in the government, because things between the
                    Soviets and the U.S. were not in good shape. They had taken an initiative early
                    in 1952 toward the Germans, to propose German unification and neutralization;
                    and that caused certain vibes in Germany. When I got into this Office of
                    Research, I was assigned to the foreign branch of that office. Questions of what
                    the Soviet intentions were with regard to Germany, what was going to happen to
                    the Korean War, how strong was the alliance between the Soviet Union and China,
                    what was going on in Eastern Europe, and the Soviets' split with Yugoslavia -
                    there were lots of things going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In those days, the sources from which we analysts worked (at least
                    at my level - I guess we may have had some fancy intelligence), were essentially
                    what we could get in the way of open sources from the Soviet Union. There was a
                    very intensive radio-monitoring program that we did jointly with the British.
                    Every morning we got a thick, yellow-covered book reprinting pages and pages of
                    texts of broadcasts from Radio Moscow and all their different radio services
                    that had been monitored, also the regional Soviet radios, and some newspaper
                    translations. The Commerce Department had a separate program for newspaper
                    translation - the Joint Press Reading Service - which had people in Moscow. They
                    translated newspapers as soon as they came onto the newspaper stands every day,
                    and sent either telegrams back or the packages back. So we got all this
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>Those were essentially our sources, plus whatever conversations our diplomats had
                    with Soviets here and there, which were not very many because we didn't have
                    that many people in touch. We had a charg�, Elim O'Shaughnessy, in Moscow. (We
                    had broken ambassadorial relations, I guess, when the Soviets kicked out
                    Ambassador George Kennan in 1952.) Although we didn't have an ambassador there,
                    the embassy was working. But our staff in Moscow were pretty much ostracized. I
                    guess they went to a few diplomatic events, National Day observances, and so on;
                    and occasionally they saw a Soviet leader, but usually not much more than a Vice
                    Foreign Minister or someone of similar rank.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>The person-to-person contact with the Soviets was very slender. We didn't have
                    exchange programs; we had defectors and we had refugees. There was a big program
                    of interviewing people who had come out at the end of the Second World War, who
                    had fled from the Soviet Union toward the end of the war and after the end of
                    the war, and they were in UNRRA camps in Europe. They were eventually released
                    from those camps, and they found places to live, including in the U.S. There was
                    a major program run by Harvard and maybe MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology) - I can't remember the consortium of universities involved - to
                    interview these people about life in the Soviet Union, going back to the 1920s
                    and the '30s. For the most part, this was material that we didn't have, because
                    (even though there were Western correspondents and some scholars there), the
                    Soviet Union was basically closed; it was a totalitarian state. We had materials
                    from those interviews from which we hopefully could project into the more
                    current period (by then, the early 1950s) some ideas about how the Communist
                    party functioned, and how the secret police functioned, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, during World War II the Department of State,
                        the Foreign Service officers, were not enthralled with the Soviet
                        Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had the White House, particularly Eleanor
                        Roosevelt, who in a way tried to put on hold, or at least eliminate,
                        skeptical reporting about the Soviet Union. At least I've heard this. Did
                        you feel any of this? Or was this-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, everybody's working off the same materials. Even the more
                    dated ones provided significant insights into the Soviet system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In the Moscow embassy, they were working off Pravda and Izvestia and
                    other newspapers, and we were working off Pravda and Izvestia; and they got the
                    radio broadcast monitoring books, and we got them, and so on. But they had
                    occasional conversations, and there were rumors in the diplomatic mill over
                    there. I think that at the time that I joined all of this in the fall of 1952,
                    the general line toward the Soviets was guarded and skeptical. I think in the
                    case of a man like Mose Harvey, it was more than skeptical.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I mean, they were still trying to digest the meaning of the Korean War. That was
                    also the time when the Soviet-sponsored peace movement began to get going, and
                    Communist front organizations and so on. The Soviets had started to become a bit
                    more active in what used to be the colonial areas of the British and the French,
                    although initially Stalin himself in a couple of interviews had questioned
                    whether the “imperlialists” were really letting go of their colonies. The
                    Soviets were very skeptical about the independence of India and other
                    post-colonial countries. They thought that was all just fake, that they were
                    stooges of the imperialists. By 1948-49, before I got to the State Department,
                    the Soviets began to be more active in what later came to be known as the Third
                    World, and active in leftist Labor movements. There were Communist or
                    pseudo-Communist parties. Front groups began to develop in various countries: in
                    India; a little bit in the Middle East; and Africa, which at that point was
                    still mostly colonial, but was beginning to de-colonize also.</p>
                <p>So that began to concern us, and some people felt that, whether Communist or
                    otherwise, the Soviets were setting out to become a global, imperialist power.
                    Of course, China had become Communist in 1949. At that particular time, they
                    were friendly with the Soviets, although we soon learned that even then there
                    were some underlying frictions; but they still were pretty close. It was the
                    general assumption (now borne out by the Soviet archives and various other
                    materials) that the Korean War was started by the North Korean leader, Kim Il
                    Sung, with Soviet support, maybe even as a Soviet stooge. In fact, it was more
                    complicated than that; there was also Mao Zedong's support. After the Chinese
                    came into the Korean War in 1950, and Soviet MiG fighters and MiG pilots were
                    involved almost from the start, it all looked like a coordinated Sino-Soviet war
                    with the U.S. But the long, bloody deadlock eventually led to an armistice after
                    Stalin's death in 1953. Korea remained split along the 38th parallel and remains
                    a major trouble spot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the job during the Korean War - I was sitting up on
                        an island in the Yellow Sea, monitoring Soviet pilots who were attacking
                        American planes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, there you go, yes. So by 1952, these attitudes began to form
                    fairly clearly, but there were differences in emphasis and differences in
                    degree. I know that Harvey had differences of opinion with Bohlen-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chip Bohlen-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Chip Bohlen [Charles Bohlen, a Russian affairs specialist and U.S.
                    Ambassador to the USSR], and maybe with some of the other State Department
                    Foreign Service people.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>There was a clear distinction in those days between policy and research, and we
                    researchers were supposed to call the shots as we saw them. But that didn't mean
                    that the Soviet Desk in the European Bureau and the other more senior people
                    didn't have their own ideas of what was going on in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, Stalin died about six weeks after Eisenhower's inauguration, on
                    March 5, 1953. There had been some sort of routine, Cold War-type exchanges
                    between them - though officially, it did not come from Stalin, because he didn't
                    have a government job [he was First Secretary or head of the Communist Party];
                    but President Voroshilov, I guess, presented congratulations. There was pretty
                    much a Cold War environment across the board.</p>
                <p>So the big issue became, just a few months after I got to the State Department:
                    How will this develop now? Could there be a Stalinist system without Stalin? Who
                    were his heirs? Of course, there were heirs announced almost immediately:
                    Malenkov and Molotov and Beria, the second triumvirate. Were they going to be
                    able to rule this place, govern this place, and were they going to be maybe more
                    aggressive, because it was generally accepted, even by people who had the
                    deepest concerns and suspicions of Stalin, that he was a cautious guy and that
                    he wasn't going to expose himself or the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>So the earlier idea, that maybe the war in Korea was a precursor to a march
                    westward in Europe, didn't really happen in that form. There were large
                    Communist parties in France and Italy, which were very pro-Soviet, although
                    underneath, some differences were beginning to bubble. These parties were
                    financed by the Soviets. And there was the world “peace” movement, and the World
                    Federation of Trade Unions, and the student groups and other “front”
                    organizations. So there was a lot of Soviet-directed machinery around that could
                    undermine Western governments and populations. But I think that the idea of a
                    Soviet attack against the West was still there. And of course, that had led to
                    the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. After the start of the Korean
                    War in 1950, the signatories added the “O” to it, and NATO began to put together
                    a military organization with coordinated forces. But it was still in its
                    infancy. So there was a lot of uncertainty about just what the death of Stalin
                    would mean.</p>
                <p>There were plenty of tea leaves that the expert Kremlinologists reviewed. I
                    wasn't quite an expert yet, but I was learning to read between the lines. I was
                    learning that it was important to compare what they said on day “x” with what
                    they said on day “x” minus ten years, or five years, or three years, or two
                    years, or one month, to see what shifts there were or what signs of disagreement
                    there were among the leaders.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>When Stalin died, I was given the task of tracking unusual moves by the Soviets.
                    What happened during March of 1953 was that the Soviets apparently worried that
                    their enemies would take advantage of the confusion resulting from Stalin's
                    death and might take some aggressive action against them. In the months after
                    his death, and while they were obviously maneuvering among themselves (Beria got
                    sacked, Malenkov got thrown out for various reasons, and then eventually
                    Khrushchev began to ascend), I made a long list of statements that they made
                    that sounded softer than they had before Stalin died. There always were
                    arguments: whether these different formulations had already started in 1951 or
                    '50, or even '48 and '49, whether it was on Berlin, or on German unification or
                    on the endless and fruitless disarmament talks. In those days, they were really
                    just talks; nobody expected that you'd actually do something, but talking about
                    disarmament was one of big activities in the Cold War. It was a tool of
                    political warfare. The Russians wielded it with considerable skill and noise
                    because they had their “peace” movement: people marching in the streets during
                    the Korean War; there was the attack on the U.S. for allegedly using biological
                    warfare, and so on. It was a big propaganda weapon, and there were constant
                    competitive disarmament proposals, mostly to abolish nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>So I started keeping a loose-leaf notebook (no computers in those days), and
                    dutifully wrote down every day what I thought might be a conciliatory move, or a
                    softening move. There was a whole mass of them: for example, some people were
                    able to get visas to visit the Soviet Union (which had previously not been
                    possible); or maybe some newspapers were permitted to have one more
                    correspondent in Moscow. Mose Harvey didn't think very much of this because he
                    thought it was all a trap, anyway; the Soviets weren't going to go soft.
                    Nevertheless, every week we diligently put together a list of things that
                    departed from what had been, more or less, the norm in the Stalin period: use of
                    words, things they said about the U.S. or about relations with the U.S., things
                    they said about Yugoslavia (their relationship had become very nasty) which
                    sounded like some sort of overture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: One of our concerns after the split with Tito (the Yugoslav leader)
                    in 1949 was that the Soviets might try some kind of action through the Serbs to
                    break up Yugoslavia. There were some signs that maybe the new rulers in Moscow
                    were throwing out some verbal come-ons to the Yugoslavs. I thought there might
                    even have been a secret visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>There also had been the question of who attended Stalin's funeral. Funerals, you
                    know, were great opportunities for Kremlinology, as was the lineup of
                    dignitaries on the mausoleum in Red Square during the annual May 1 parade after
                    Stalin's death. He died on March 5, 1953, so May 1 was the first opportunity to
                    look at the leadership lineup. As I recall, the funeral procession had been a
                    bit confusing. We clearly could not send a prominent person to represent the
                    United States at Stalin's funeral. Our Ambassador, George Kennan, had been
                    thrown out of Moscow in 1952. Our charge, Elim O'Shaughnessy, marched in the
                    procession wearing a borrowed formal suit, trying all the way to prevent the
                    striped pants from dropping to the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:[Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Of course, our military attach�s looked closely at the weapons that
                    the Soviets were parading.</p>
                <p>So it wasn't only that it was a new job for me, but I was getting propelled into
                    what was our main absorption and concern in the foreign policy arena. I really
                    got quite stimulated; and I worked with extraordinarily able, knowledgeable, and
                    thoughtful people who had been at it a lot longer than I had.</p>
                <p>One of the people who came to work with us temporarily in 1953 was a man who had
                    been close to Truman's Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, who, of course, was no
                    longer there. Secretary Dulles knew him also, but because he'd been so close to
                    Dean Acheson, he was advised to spend some time in the Soviet Research Office.
                    He himself had gone to Columbia, where he had gotten a certificate in Russian
                    studies. This was Marshall Shulman. I don't know whether he's in your oral
                    history series or not; he later worked again in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, [he's not].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>While he was with Acheson, Marshall was also, to some extent, his mouthpiece -
                    not the official public spokesman, but Acheson's contact with journalists around
                    town. We became quite friendly. I wasn't married yet. In the summer of 1953, it
                    was hot as hell, and he invited me to stay in the basement of his home in
                    Alexandria, where it was cooler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. This was a big deal!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So we spent a fair amount of time together. Through Marshall, I was
                    introduced to Henry Brandon (a British journalist in Washington), Peter Lisagor
                    (a Chicago Daily News reporter whom Marshall had known when he, himself, was a
                    journalist before the war), and several others. Since I was working on Soviet
                    affairs, they were interested in talking to me; and since they knew everybody in
                    town, including people in the White House, it was a wonderful way for me to find
                    out what was going on in town, which I didn't in my little office cubbyhole in
                    that converted apartment building there on 23rd Street.</p>
                <p>I guess the Security people got wind of the fact that I knew journalists, and
                    they started watching me, and then tapping my home telephone.</p>
                <p>When Fritz Kraemer came back from Oberammergau, sometime in the late '40s, we
                    picked up our friendship again. He started working at MSA (Mutual Security
                    Agency), which was the Marshall Plan Agency, and eventually ended up in the
                    Pentagon as a guru over there. We used to have long telephone conversations in
                    the evenings, and they were mostly in German.</p>
                <p>Kraemer liked to speak German, although he spoke English perfectly - with a heavy
                    accent, but very fluent, sophisticated English. Still, he liked to speak German.
                    I hadn't really spoken all that much German, except during my period in the Army
                    in Germany. Whoever was tapping my phone apparently got suspicious about my long
                    conversations with somebody in German. They started putting cylinders (in those
                    days) on their listening machines, to tape our conversations. A man whom I came
                    to know later, who worked in the Security office, told me at some point, “You
                    know, there are stacks and stacks and stacks of transcripts of your
                    conversations with Fritz Kraemer, and translations of them; and somebody's been
                    going through them in the Security office to see what they amounted to.”</p>
                <p>Actually, Kraemer did practically all the talking (he was a very voluble guy);
                    and I did very little. So all this later became part of my security file. It
                    kicked around through the '50s. I don't think they ever really got anything out
                    of it that led them to do anything more than just store the transcripts, and
                    maybe write some notes on the(I don't know what the hell they did with them) -
                    until later, a guy who was not in my office, but in what by then had become the
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research, denounced me as an Israeli spy.</p>
                <p>This guy claimed that he had seen me give the plans for the American invasion of
                    Lebanon to some Israelis at a cocktail party at the Israeli Embassy (where,
                    incidentally, I'd never been).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1958 </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: July 1958, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He had, I think, maybe denounced me some time before that. But
                    anyway, that was supposed to be the real proof that there was something
                    suspicious going on. In fact, a) I'd never been in the Israeli Embassy; b) I had
                    nothing to do with Lebanon - I was a Soviet analyst - so the notion that I could
                    have gotten hold of war plans for landing in Lebanon was ludicrous. Even if I
                    had been working on Lebanon, I would never have seen any war plans!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But anyway, that accusation fascinated Mr. Otepka, in the Security
                    office. So this stuff was accumulating, as well as these conversations with
                    Kraemer. I don't know what the Security people had on Kissinger and me. I think
                    Kissinger finished his Ph.D. in 1954, and he got some consulting jobs here with
                    the Army's research office, Office of Research and Operations, a semi-private
                    organization. All the services had them, and still have them: CNA (Center for
                    Naval Analyses) is one now for the Navy, and the Air Force had RAND (a
                    contraction of the term research and development), and the Joint Staff had the
                    IDA (Institute for Defense Analyses), and the Army had ORO (Operations Research
                    Office). All of these were affiliated loosely with some university. ORO actually
                    was affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.</p>
                <p>So Henry came down here more frequently, and we would meet more often because
                    he'd stay with Kraemer. Then he asked me to come up to Harvard once or twice to
                    give a talk in his course on world politics. In those days, this was permissible
                    for government officials: you just put in a form [saying that you planned to
                    speak at a seminar.] I don't know whether Kissinger got drawn into the periodic
                    telephone-tapping that was going on - you know, in those days, just the updating
                    or renewal of a security clearance frequently involved the use of wire taps!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was just a routine way to do that until much later, when they had
                    to get warrants for wire-tapping. It was just a routine thing. The upshot of all
                    of that was that while there was a security ripple running through my career
                    before I ended up in the White House in 1969, it continued after that. J. Edgar
                    Hoover [Director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation)] had a whole list
                    of “suspicious” people that Kissinger had hired for the NSC [National Security
                    Council] staff, including me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: This security “ripple” finally went away in the '70s; but it had
                    rattled around for years. It all started, I think, because of this thing I had
                    said about a Jewish state, when I was interviewed by the Immigration officer in
                    New York in April 1944, when I arrived in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But it didn't stop my career. It came close once or twice, I guess.
                    But I got started in the State Department in December of '52, and gradually
                    crept up the ladder. There was something called “Wristonization” [integration of
                    the Civil Service and the Foreign Service] that came along in 1954-55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was a civil servant, and I didn't want to be “Wristonized” and go
                    into the Foreign Service, partly because my wife (we were married in October
                    1953) was professionally active, and because my parents were alive. I had left
                    them at age 11, came back very briefly before going into the Army, and was gone
                    again for two years. They were getting older, and I just didn't feel that I
                    should go abroad again. So I decided to stay a civil servant, which wasn't the
                    healthiest thing to do, because Under Secretary Loy Henderson, who managed a lot
                    of personnel issues, basically wanted to have the wholState Department, except
                    maybe the Legal Advisor's Office and one or two other units, in one personnel
                    systethe Foreign Service. They were doing nothing to encourage civil servants to
                    stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I [remember] that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So I had a period of maybe two or three years when I wasn't
                    promoted, but then after that, promotions came pretty steadily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is probably a good place to stop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is November 14, 2000. All right, let's pick up with the change when Dulles
                    came in. Was there a palpable change from your perspective, or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, my perspective on January 20 or 21, 1953 was kind of a
                    worm's-eye view. I was low down in the R Area, which didn't have any policy
                    responsibilities. I don't think Dulles expected to have much contact with it,
                    except maybe with the Director, Park Armstrong. Then perhaps some of the senior
                    people in the R Area gradually did have some contact with the political
                    appointees who came in with Dulles.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, of course, one of the things that perked up everybody's
                    ears was when there was a gathering to greet the new Secretary of State and his
                    team on what were then the back steps of New State (of course, by now it's all
                    part of the State Department Building), where a week or two earlier there had
                    been a farewell to Dean Acheson and his team. Dulles made remarks about
                    expecting “positive loyalty” from all the people in the State Department. No one
                    quite knew exactly what he might mean, but people looked around and wondered.
                    But you have to remember, by this time we were well into the various loyalty
                    programs and the new security programs instituted in the Truman administration;
                    and we were also in the McCarthy period. So people, I think, wondered what
                    exactly this “positive loyalty” meant. That statement was widely reported in the
                    press. There were questions about whether it meant a further clean sweep of
                    people from the previous administration, at least at policy levels. I think
                    things settled down in that regard before too long, and the career people went
                    about their jobs.</p>
                <p>We, in the R Area, went about our job, which was to gather as much information as
                    we could, mostly in those days from unclassified or very low classification
                    sources, to figure out what the Soviets were up to. We were watching very
                    carefully how the Soviets reacted to the new administration. Of course, shortly
                    after the new administration came in, Stalin died, on March 5, 1953. So we were
                    quite occupied with figuring out what was going on in the Soviet Union, and what
                    was going to happen in the Soviet Union; we were trying to tabulate as best we
                    could whatever possibly looked like some indication of how they expected to deal
                    with the United States. I don't know of any instance where there was any sort of
                    pressure on us to come up with particular slants to the information, nor were
                    there any efforts to figure out what the Secretary of State or the other
                    high-level people might like to [hear].</p>
                <p>George Kennan and “Chip” Bohlen were not in Dulles's inner group. I can't
                    remember when Kennan left the government. He had been Ambassador in Moscow. The
                    Soviets PNGed him (declared him persona non grata) because of some remarks that
                    he made comparing the Soviet Union to Hitler Germany - at least ostensibly, that
                    was the reason. He had left by 1953, although, of course, he had been such a
                    formidable figure in the State Department when it came to U.S. policy toward the
                    Soviet Union, and U.S. policy more generally, that there undoubtedly remained
                    certain reverberations of his influence. President Kennedy appointed him
                    Ambassador to Yugoslavia in 1961.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Bohlen was nominated to be Ambassador to Moscow, mostly at President Eisenhower's
                    behest. His nomination got held up for months by McCarthy-type critics, but it
                    was finally approved and he went to Moscow around April of 1953. In 1956, Dulles
                    recalled him and had him posted to Manila.</p>
                <p>Marshall Shulman was another Sovietologist who had worked closely with Acheson as
                    a speechwriter and advisor. He knew Secretary Dulles: he had worked with Dulles
                    during the negotiations for the Japanese Peace Treaty in 1951, and he knew him
                    in other connections. But he had been close to Acheson, so he was sent to our
                    office in the R Area for a while. He had originally been a Sovietologist. He
                    eventually left the State Department to go to Harvard, I think, and work on a
                    Ph.D. dissertation.</p>
                <p>So there was some turnover in personnel in the Soviet field. I can't remember how
                    long it took to get the first Eisenhower administration ambassador to Moscow.
                    But it made no particular difference to us in the R Area who the ambassador was.
                    We were doing our thing of trying to figure out what was going on in the Soviet
                    Union and what it meant for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling, a sort of an initial burst of
                        expectation, when Stalin died that things might change? Or was it pretty
                        much, things will go on as usual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I think there was some expectation that there would be some
                    changes.</p>
                <p>There was also an expectation, which essentially proved correct - that there
                    would be a struggle for power - that there had been signs of maneuvering in the
                    top leadership for quite a while. There always were. Despite the fact that this
                    system claimed to be monolithic and they all claimed to be good Communist
                    Bolsheviks, they were, in fact, constantly engaged in infighting. Of course,
                    people had been executed; and there was the “Doctors' Plot” (Stalin's charges
                    that certain doctormost of them Jewiswere conspiring to kill him). So there were
                    all sorts of signs of uncertainty in the leadership before his death; and then
                    the way the death itself was handled, the way the announcements were made,
                    suggested internal divisions.</p>
                <p>When Stalin's death was made public, there was the famous TASS reference to
                    avoiding “panic and disarray.” These were pithy words suggesting that there was
                    indeed some disarray. There were three people who followed Stalin by agreement:
                    Malenkov, Molotov, and Beria (the secret police chief) - and that arrangement
                    proved not to be stable later in the year.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>So the expectations were 1) that there would be uncertainty in Moscow, an2) that
                    there might be some changes. For us, the question of Soviet ties to the Korean
                    War was very much on our minds. Even though the Berlin blockade had long been
                    ended, there were still all kinds of maneuvers around that. There had been
                    Soviet atomic bomb explosions, and the question of the hydrogen bomb. So there
                    were lots of things going on that marked that phase of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>There was a question of who should represent the U.S. at Stalin's funeral. I
                    think it turned out that our charg� in Moscow, Elim O'Shaughnessy, who had been
                    there since Kennan was kicked out, went to the funeral; and I think Jacob Beam,
                    a career official, joined the delegation; but there wasn't any formal
                    representation. There must have been some kind of a formal condolence note.</p>
                <p>Our office, called DRS (Division of Research for the Soviet Union) in those days,
                    started a list of things Soviets did and said that suggested that they might be
                    looking not for some grand settlement, but to cool the temperature in relations
                    with the U.S.. There had been some signs of this earlier. Before Stalin's death,
                    he'd given a couple of set-piece interviews, and there were some suggestive
                    phrases. Earlier in 1952, there had been two Soviet notes to the Western powers
                    offering a unified Germany, provided it was neutral; but the proposal had many
                    flaws concerning the election process and other issues. In Washington, it was
                    not taken particularly seriously. In Germany, there were some people who thought
                    that there might be some opportunity, and it still rattles around in German
                    historiography in debates whether the Germans were deprived of an opportunity to
                    re-unify. But we remained dubious. I think, actually, it was only after the
                    Eisenhower administration came in and after Stalin's death that a reply was sent
                    to Moscow.</p>
                <p>In our office, we had also done some analysis and raised questions as to the
                    Soviet initiative's seriousness. But in many western governments, including
                    ours, there also were judgments that Moscow was attempting to complicate western
                    plans to include German military forces in the emerging European Defense
                    Community (EDC). In Germany, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) opposed these
                    plans, and Moscow may have hoped to strengthen this opposition.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the question of Germany's future led in early 1954 to a meeting in
                    Berlin between Dulles and Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister. By that time
                    there had been changes in the top Soviet leadership: Malenkov had been demoted
                    and Beria had been arrested. We found out subsequently that Beria had tried to
                    move on German issues as well, but on his own, with some kind of initiative.
                    It's been pretty well documented by historians. We didn't know about it at the
                    time, although there was some intelligence suggesting that he showed up in East
                    Berlin at some point in this period. But eventually he was arrested and
                    executed. So there were changes, but Molotov was Molotov, and he was tough-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd been around for a long, long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And he continued for many years, but in lesser roles. There were
                    some things that started happening in '53 and '54. One of them had to do with
                    the still-pending Austrian peace treaty. That was actually a reason for
                    convening the Berlin Conference in January or February of 1954. That led to
                    certain steps which ultimately in 1955 produced the state treaty that settled
                    the Austrian question. Austria became neutraan outcome which some people in
                    Germany saw as a precedent for them. Among them were those who thought Moscow's
                    1952 notes should have been taken more seriously.</p>
                <p>There had been squabbles over Trieste with the Yugoslavs. Of course, by that time
                    Yugoslavia had split from the Soviet Union and had been expelled from the
                    Cominfor(Communist Information Bureau) by Stalin. So Yugoslavia was no longer an
                    actor on the Soviet string, as it were, but it was still a problem in terms of
                    relationships in Europe. Eventually, the Trieste issue was resolved to the
                    satisfaction of Italy and Yugoslavia, and approved by the major powers,
                    including the U.S. and the USSR.</p>
                <p>There were a few other things, like Soviet officials' visits back and forth, not
                    only to the U.S., but to other countries; more of low-level exchanges, and so
                    on. I can't remember all of them, but I had collected perhaps a hundred of these
                    rather tenuous occurrences. As Kremlinologists, we counted many cases of
                    phrasing being changed in Pravda or in the magazine Bolshevik, later called
                    Kommunist, the major authoritative publication.</p>
                <p>Soon after Stalin's death, Prime Minister Churchill proposed publicly that the
                    wise thing to do was to meet with the new leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Dulles didn't like that idea at all. There have been some stories we
                    didn't know about (we weren't anywhere near that level), that Eisenhower, I
                    guess by temperament, wasn't altogether opposed to Churchill's idea. After all,
                    Churchill was a great figure and a great hero; and Eisenhower had worked with
                    him during the war. But I think Dulles didn't like the idea of getting the
                    president personally involved in summitry. You know, we still had something of
                    the old tradition that the president oughtn't to be on the front line of
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So nothing much came of that. Churchill, with his experience and his
                    view of the world, I guess, figured (as he said in World War II when he backed
                    the Soviets after the Nazis invaded Russia), that if for the sake of defeating
                    the Nazis, he'd have to eat dinner with the devil, he'd certainly do it with a
                    long spoon - the famous saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't think that Churchill, having done so during the War, had
                    quite the same inhibitions of dealing with Stalin or his successors that our
                    people did. We have a somewhat different way of looking at this phenomenon of
                    unspeakable dictators, and just exactly what to do with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, too, was this a certain reflection of Dulles, who at
                        least is purported to have been rather, “either you're with us or against
                        us”? I mean, you know, they go back to his Presbyterian elder background and
                        all of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, well, I think there was something to that. He said at one press
                    conference, “You can recognize neutrality, or neutralism, but you don't have to
                    hold it to your bosom and call it good.” I don't think the word “nonaligned” was
                    yet in use; but neutrality between good and evil was not something that Dulles
                    was prepared to countenance.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, just to skip right to the present, there was recently, in the year
                    2000, a report on UN (United Nations) peacekeeping operations by a former
                    Algerian Foreign Minister, Brahimi. One of the things he criticized in that
                    report was the neutrality of the UN forces in Bosnia. He said that you have to
                    distinguish between good and evil in these situations, and the UN cannot be
                    agnostic, or something of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So anyway, Dulles had his doubts about neutrality, and he certainly
                    had his doubts about the moral worth or any notion of moral equality with the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>There were others who worried about the Soviets getting nuclear weapons, and how
                    to deal with such weapons in the hands of the Communists. Over the years, that
                    led to more active disarmament or arms control talks, but really not to any
                    concrete measures in the Dulles period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at the Soviets in this transition thing,
                        were we seeing, I mean, you know, you were talking?I'm trying to sort of get
                        inside you. You know, you're looking at it, and granted, you're way down in
                        the hierarchy, but were you seeing any signs to be optimistic, or was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't think that?first of all, we weren't supposed to be
                    optimistic or pessimistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, yes, yes. But [laughter] </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We were supposed to call it as we saw it. I can't say that I saw
                    anything more than what I would call Soviet tactics - verbal tactics or other
                    kinds of tactics - to buy themselves some quiet. The words I was groping for
                    earlier were “panic” and “disarray”, and I will insert them when you send me the
                    transcript of our talk.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That is what a TASS dispatch referred to after Stalin's death, to
                    buy themselves some time to somehow straighten out where things were headed in
                    the transition; and I think they felt a little queasy without the grand old man
                    [Stalin] up there telling them what to do, even though they'd been around for a
                    long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. He was a hard taskmaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So I don't think that they were looking to pick a fight with us. I
                    think they were probably quite willing to see some sort of a deal on Korea,
                    which always had some potential for escalation. I think we noted that. We saw
                    that there might be some movement on Austria coming along (this is a little
                    later); and one or two other things I felt had some promise, but not for a
                    settlement! Then there was Stalin's proposal for Germany floating around, as it
                    continued to do for a long time, where again there was some seeming
                    flexibility.</p>
                <p>But my judgment wa(I guess there were some differences of opinion) that any sign
                    of flexibility at that point by the Soviets on these by then well-understood,
                    contested, confrontational situations - any sign of flexibility was essentially
                    a tactical thing and did not hold out promise for rolling back the reel, as it
                    were, to some more cooperative relationship. SI wasn't afraid that there would
                    be a war, although there had been the debate whether the start of the Korean War
                    (in 1950, when I wasn't yet in the government) portended a more aggressive
                    Soviet role, all around, including in Europe. That resulted in the formation of
                    NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty had been signed in 1949, but the “O,” the
                    organization and the SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe)
                    headquarters, the military part of it, didn't come until after the Korean War
                    started.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>There were still disagreements as to Soviet intentions, but I think there was
                    (and I shared it) a sense that we were at that point where the Soviets were
                    trying to sort out their own situation, and they wouldn't have been particularly
                    eager to get involved in a big fight with us. But much of their policy was aimed
                    at slowing down and disrupting the increasing Western consolidation through
                    NATO, the various institutional arrangements in the economic and financial
                    areas, and, in Europe, what became steps toward the eventual European Economic
                    Community.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relations between the research side and
                        the Soviet Desk at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I personally was a relative newcomer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I got to know some of the people on the Desk, but I had nothing in
                    particular to do with it. The people who had been in our shop longer obviously
                    knew the people on the Soviet Desk and the Foreign Service people who were
                    specialists in Soviet Affairs. In fact, there was an arrangement between the
                    European Bureau and the R Area that our office could have one or two people in
                    Moscow for a year or two, to be on the ground there, to help with analyzing the
                    Soviet press and especially the provincial press, which was one of the major
                    sources to try to gather information, and they knew each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And inhale the atmospherics too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, and they took some trips in the hinterland together. But I
                    think the stuff that we produced in the R Area, in our office, was ours. You
                    know, it might have been discussed with some people on the Soviet Desk; and we
                    talked about the interpretation and assessment of whatever it was that we were
                    concerned about. We published these things on a weekly basis, and some special
                    papers whenever they were ready, not necessarily regularly. When I say
                    published, these reports had some security classification, maybe “confidential”,
                    occasionally “secret”. But they went out as our INR papers. The Desk was a
                    consumer?and if they disagreed, I guess they sent memos to their own people and
                    to us, disagreeing with our views.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Later, as I climbed up the ladder a bit and got more involved in the formal
                    estimative process in the intelligence community (which was run by CIA but in
                    which all the agencies were represented), we talked with our colleagues on the
                    Desk and maybe in the Policy Planning Staff, to get their views on the
                    particular issue that was the subject of a National Intelligence Estimate draft,
                    in the interagency process. But we did not make any commitment that their view
                    would be our view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But there was more contact with the policy side. Then much later, as
                    I stayed on in the R Area, later INR, I had fairly active contacts personally. I
                    became a Branch Chief and then Division Chief, and then eventually the Office
                    Director, and I had wider contacts because I wanted to know what was going on in
                    the policy area, so that I could somehow integrate that more into my thoughts
                    about what we were reading or getting through some fancy intelligence and other
                    sources. I used to stop in regularly to see Tommy Thompson when he had come back
                    from Moscow, where he'd been our Ambassador (and then he became Dean Rusk's
                    Special Advisor for Soviet Affairs), just because I felt that the input of
                    experienced people who were sitting across the table from the Soviets on this or
                    that issue was important.</p>
                <p>There used to be something of a divide which affected not so much the
                    Sovietologists in the State Department, but a lot of the people who were dealing
                    with the Soviet Union. Because they had to negotiate something, they might have
                    had participants from the Sovietological communitbut in practice, they gave
                    weight mostly to what they heard across the green table. We in the R Area gave
                    weight mostly to what we read in the publications, what we got through CIA and
                    through NSA (National Security Agency). We were really cut off from a lot of
                    what went on at the negotiating table; so there was a bit of a mismatch as to
                    what people gave weight to. I remember talking to one person (this was later),
                    who told me such and such and such and such happened at the negotiations, and
                    that they had a dinner one night, and Soviet counterparts said this, that, and
                    the other.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, it's interesting; but it doesn't really square with what we get
                    through our sources.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, you know, that's the problem. That's just propaganda stuff. You
                    guys pay too much attention to that. What really counts is what these people
                    tell us!”</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I personally took the view that what they tell you often has a very particular
                    purpose. Or an American listener may have some predisposition, and interprets
                    what he hears as something that may confirm his views. All of it was important
                    as part of the information pool that we sought to weigh. In INR, we were getting
                    what Soviets were saying to each other through their own publications or by
                    other means, and what they were saying to their own people as part of ruling
                    them, governing them. But in other reports, we also saw what they were saying
                    over cocktails with an American diplomat. What carried more weight? In analyzing
                    true Soviet intentions, ambitions, objectives, I never quite settled it in my
                    own mind. But, once I moved over to the policy side, I gradually paid more
                    attention to what - (of course, we were then dealing with the top level, from
                    Brezhnev on down) - I paid more attention to what I was hearing than to what my
                    former colleagues and the CIA people were assiduously collecting and analyzing
                    from their sources. But I still tried to make use of their insights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also there could possibly be almost a two-track
                        system, not on purpose, but what you were getting maybe from the people
                        talking would be sort of their thoughts going around; whereas the
                        bureaucracy, which is extremely important in ruling, was cranking out its
                        orders. You know, I mean, who knows?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Who knows is right! A lot of content analysis, for example, of the
                    vast amount of printed stuff and radio broadcasts and later TV broadcasts - they
                    were all translated but sometimes kept in their original language; there's a
                    huge amount of material - we went on the theory that this was all conscious
                    stuff. If there was some kind of a strange formulation, it was always a guessing
                    game whether it was a deliberate effort to obfuscate and mislead, again because
                    it was so ordered; or whether it might actually reflect some movement that they
                    were signaling through some obscure form of words; or whether there were
                    differences among the Soviets themselves. We could detect differences among
                    them. We all heard Malenkov, going back to '53, sayin(I mean, we read his
                    statements; they were widely printed at the time) that a nuclear war would spell
                    the end of civilization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But that was not the Soviet line-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -because you can't have an end to history under the Marxist-Leninist
                    ideology! History goes on. So here comes the Soviet leader who says, “The
                    subjective man, by launching the nuclear war, can stop the objective process of
                    history.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, Khrushchev called him on it, said something different about
                    what a nuclear war would mean. He said he didn't deny that it would be extremely
                    damaging, even catastrophic, and we should avoid it; but it wouldn't end the
                    world. But, you know, this was a theological dispute. That wasn't presumably the
                    only reason why Malenkov was demoted and sent out to be the director of a power
                    plant, after having been at the very top and near the top before. So we tracked
                    that stuff. The Sino-Soviet conflict, which began to develop in the '50s, often
                    centered on this sort of orthodoxy, even though there also were less esoteric
                    disputes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any indicators of this at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes! We saw differences between the Soviets and the Chinese,
                    including on the question of nuclear war, as a matter of fact, but on a whole
                    host of other issues. A colleague of ours, long since back in the academic
                    world, Donald Zagoria, was at CIA doing the same sort of thing that we were
                    doing. He produced a thick volume, classified at the time, in 1956 or '57,
                    showing the symptoms of major conflict and disputes between the Soviets and the
                    Chinese. It was later published. CIA took out some classified material, but then
                    released it, and it was a sensation at the time.</p>
                <p>You know, I was conservative; I accepted the notion that Marxist-Leninists had
                    disputes, and even killed each other over them. But in the end, they believe in
                    the same thing; so we ought to be very careful before we assume that there was a
                    real conflict between the Soviet Union and China. A lot of other Sovietologists
                    of what you might call the “hard line” school thought this conflict was
                    unlikely, or may even be a trick to lull us into some false sense of
                    security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you looking at the Yugoslav breaking away as
                        being an indicator of how something might happen? In other words, was this
                        seen as something completely extraneous to anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or was this seen as something that, I mean certain things
                        happened to Yugoslav-Soviet relationships, so we should start looking at
                        those things happening in other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, that was obviously a subject of controversy. Eventually
                    Milovan Djilas wrote about it; he was a close associate of Tito's.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>No, I think the Soviet-Yugoslav break was a major surprise, in a way. Maybe some
                    Sovietologists or some experts on Yugoslavia didn't think it was a surprise
                    because they believed it was inevitable that sooner or later they'd break up.
                    What is interesting - what I certainly did not realize or expect at the time (it
                    actually happened before I got in the government) - was that apparently the real
                    reason why Stalin, in effect, threw Tito and Yugoslavia out of the Cominform,
                    (which was the new edition of the Comintern or Communist International, which
                    had been suspended or abolished during World War II as a gesture toward the
                    West) was that he felt that Tito was being too aggressive in fanning the Greek
                    Civil War, and over Trieste and other issues. Stalin feared that the result
                    would be that the Americans, who might otherwise have left Europe or would leave
                    Europe, because Americans don't like to stay overseas, would come back and stay
                    there; and Stalin was totally opposed to that. So he thought Tito might drag him
                    into a war; he thought Tito might make permanent the American presence in
                    Europe. I think that concern was more deeply rooted than the ideological
                    differences. There might have been psychological and personality differences
                    between the two as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Tito had shot down some American planes that
                        flew over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, that was in the Trieste area.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, this is not a benign period!</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No. Well, by that time the Soviets had also shot down our planes -
                    we had lost a couple of espionage planes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But the fundamental point was that those people who were inclined to
                    believe that there were serious problems developing between the Soviet Union and
                    China later in the '50s pointed to the 1949 Tito-Yugoslav example as
                    demonstrating that such a thing could indeed happen, and wasn't just a ruse, or
                    wasn't just something that would ultimately be resolved because they all were
                    Marxist-Leninists.</p>
                <p>There were, incidentally, some gestures from the post-Stalin leadership to Tito
                    to see if they could at least normalize if not restore their relationship; and
                    Tito was somewhat receptive, although there had been all these Titoist trials in
                    the satellite countries, and people were executed left and right because of
                    their alleged “Titoism.” Later, it was also an issue in the case of the Viet
                    Cong or of North Vietnam.</p>

                        mean this is not -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The question is, was this all a Soviet-directed grand strategy of
                    global expansion? There were people who said, “Well, this conflict has its own
                    national roots in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, and so on; just as the Chinese
                    revolution, while it was supported by the Soviets, had its own leaders and
                    national roots; as Tito did in Yugoslavia; and therefore, one shouldn't rule out
                    that beneath the veneer of Marxist-Leninist unity and the international
                    Communist movement, there were substantial differences of perception of
                    interests, and that there was resistance to Soviet domination of their own
                    national parties.”</p>
                <p>Well, I came around to this view late in the '50s. I'd been skeptical of it
                    because I thought Marxism-Leninism would be the glue that bound them together.
                    Then, as it turned out, there was more conflict among Communists than between
                    Communists and capitalists!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Well, I mean part of the thing was we were to
                        some extent caught in our own rhetoric-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That this is a big vast conspiracy, and they're all

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. And there's a vast amount of literature, including some
                    official literature, that took that general view. The Congress published all
                    sorts of hearings and studies, not only the House Un-American Affairs Committee,
                    but other committees. It, of course, had its echoes in this country: there was a
                    Communist party here, there were branches of the world peace movement, and
                    various other Communist “fronts”, as they were called; and there were Americans
                    who attended the big rallies they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and Youth groups another one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: CIA financed a lot of people to penetrate those organizations -</p>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The International Student Union, for example, and the World Trade
                    Union Organization, which was communist-dominated. There was another union group
                    that wasn't. So yes, I think the notion of a relatively monolithic communist
                    movement, a goal-oriented operation supporting the Soviets in whatever issue
                    came along - whether it was atomic weapons, the world peace movement, the
                    marches and the rallies that were all over the place - that all suggested a
                    movement that was centrally directed, and maybe centrally-financed as well. But
                    I think the proposition that, underneath all of that there was, in fact, a
                    propensity for division, was valid. In my case, I think I got there certainly by
                    1960, but it was slow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you were with INR. Well, I mean you were in the

                        happened? Did you continue in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I continued there until 1960. I had become rather specialized in
                    Soviet disarmament policy, or it was called “disarmament” in those days. You
                    know, we had these constant meetings through the UN, and I actually participated
                    as a Soviet expert in a delegation led by Harold Stassen at meetings in London
                    with the British, French, Canadians, and Soviets. They met for several years in
                    a row in the mid-'50s. In 1955, before a four-power summit, the Soviets
                    published a grand scheme for staged disarmament. But these were all negotiations
                    about words, not about the details of actually doing things. In the 1960
                    presidential election campaign-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, at the end of the Eisenhower administration. There was quite
                    a bit of criticism around the country that we weren't doing enough for peace,
                    that we had millions of people in the military and elsewhere, and that
                    everything that we did was focused on war, but not enough on peace, not enough
                    on curbing the nuclear arms race. There was the “Pugwash movement” [named for
                    the site of a pro-disarmament conference in Pugwash, Nova Scotia] and so on. A
                    lot of Americans were restless. So Eisenhower decided to do Nixon a favor, give
                    Nixon a little help. By Executive Order, he created the U.S. Disarmament Agency
                    [later called the Arms Control and Disarmament Administration, ACDA] in October
                    of 1960, shortly before the election to show that-</p>

                    people when it was set up, initially under Edmund Gullion, a senior Foreign

                    maybe in the mid-to-late 1950s. I was told that maybe it had to do with my
                    knowing some journalists and going out to lunch with them occasionally. So there
                    was a file being kept on me. Then I heard that they were also tapping my phone,
                    office phone, or home phone, which I assumed they would do anyway to people like
                    me who held high clearances - so it didn't particularly disturb me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Except for what seeped through in the gossip, I don't think I had
                    any special problems. However, as I told you, there was the “Wristonization”
                    personnel program in the State Department-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in the mid-'50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And I remained a civil servant, rather than integrate into the
                    Foreign Service. There was some effort to get rid of these “indigestibles,” as
                    Under Secretary Loy Henderson called them, or at least induce them to go
                    elsewhere. It occurred to me in retrospect that, in my case, they didn't say
                    “leave”, but the promotions didn't come very fast, if at all, in the mid-'50s. I
                    think I was stuck at GS-9 or maybe GS-11 for several years. This security
                    question must have played a role in that. I don't think it was Scott McLeod (the
                    Director of the Security office); I think it was a fellow named Otepka, who was
                    in the State Department, who was the linchpin of these allegations against
                    me.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The Director of INR, Hugh Cumming, was always very polite and friendly to me; but
                    I understood that he had some problems about my being around, partly because of
                    my Civil Service status, and partly because there was some unresolved security
                    issue. It may have been my acquaintance with journalists. But what happened, in
                    fact, I discovered early in the Kennedy administration, when I was excluded from
                    a meeting in the Pentagon in 1961. It was explained to me that there was a
                    security clearance issue, and I heard more stories like that. Finally, after
                    Roger Hilsman became the Director of INR in the Kennedy administration, I said,
                    “Look, I want this cleared up, whatever it is.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I finally managed to get an appointment with Otepka, and I learned
                    that somebody had denounced me as an Israeli spy and had alleged that I had
                    given our plans for the U.S. Marine landings in Lebanon in 1958 to the Israelis,
                    at a cocktail party at the home of an Israeli Embassy officer. Nothing had ever
                    been said to me about this until I forced the issue, three years later!</p>
                <p>In his interrogation, Otepka showed me a bunch of documents that related to that
                    allegation and asked, “Did you ever, have you ever seen this, have you ever had
                    this in your possession?”</p>
                <p>And, of course, I hadn't. I had nothing to do with Lebanon. I had nothing to do
                    with war plans. I had nothing to do with the Israeli Embassy! But there was this
                    guy who had concocted this, and he apparently had denounced some other people in
                    regard to other things. His denunciation was on file in the Security office.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I was given a polygraph [lie-detector] test, which I passed with
                    flying colors. Otepka then took the position that, well, that's fine;
                    polygraphs, of course, make mistakes. But he did put some document in my file
                    stating that I had passed this test, subject to the usual limitations of this
                    instrument. Eventually - because some of these security clearances that I had
                    held had not exactly been withdrawn, but they may have been suspended - the
                    Defense Department named a panel of three people to review my case. I remember
                    that Paul Nitze was one of them, Adam Yarmolinsky was another, and the third one
                    I can't remember. But they went over my case and cleared me! That was in
                    1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whew!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That was it! Even then, there were still occasions when my phones
                    were tapped, because that was a routine thing - a telephone tap was an
                    investigative device just for upgrading security clearances. The laws were
                    changed later, in the Nixon administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I can't remember now what happened to Otepka, but I think he may
                    still be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was put into ? exile. He was sitting at a desk
                        with no phone in an office, and left to languish there ?..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Something like that, yes. Anyway, going back to my work, and my
                    appointment to the U.S. Disarmament Agency, which John McCloy headed when
                    Kennedy became president. I became quite friendly with McCloy, and I went to
                    Moscow with him in 1961. His instructions were to try to get some movement on
                    arms control, and also to talk to Khrushchev about the still-extant Soviet
                    demand to turn West Berlin into a “Free City”. We actually agreed to
                    reconstitute a disarmament forum in the UN, which the Soviets had boycotted for
                    months.</p>
                <p>Another of McCloy's tasks was to create a permanent agency to replace the
                    organization that had been established late in 1960 by President Eisenhower's
                    Executive Order. I decided to leave the agency when the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency was established by Congress. I asked to go back to INR; and I
                    did that in late 1961, which is when the security questions that I've just
                    described surfaced.</p>
                <p>I went back to INR and had a very nice career in INR after that. I became
                    Division Chief for Soviet foreign policy; then Deputy Office Director, and
                    Office Director in maybe 1963-64. I was very much involved in the Cuban missile
                    crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We really haven't covered the short time you were with the
                        arms control thing in 1959 or so or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, that was 1960-61.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll talk about that. One other question I'd like to
                        ask, because you've mentioned a number of times about the Wriston program in
                        INR and the feeling that you were sort of the odd man out, that you weren't
                        Foreign Service? If we would talk a little about the feeling in INR, that
                        maybe it would be a good idea to have people who had some depth of
                        experience in there, rather than Foreign Service officers who may come from
                        the field - but they don't have the history.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. There were others in INR who were in the same boat as I, and
                    there was some recognition that a permanent, or at least long-term group was an
                    asset, in addition to the Foreign Service officers on short assignments.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 15, 2000. You want to talk a little bit
                        about INR and the staffing during this '59ish period or so, with the
                        division between Civil Service and Foreign Service, your impressions at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I came there in December 1952 to the Soviet and East European
                    Research Division. I can't recall exactly, thinking back 50 years, but I think
                    virtually everybody was a civil servant. They did have a program, at least in
                    our Division, of rotating some people to the embassy in Moscow to do work
                    similar to what they did in Washington, but closer to the action and with less
                    delay in getting the newspapers, provincial newspapers, and journals, which we
                    got by mail or slow pouch. And they would be there in the climate, in the
                    context, and so on. They, of course, developed friendships in the process with
                    the Foreign Service people. Maybe some of the other divisions had somewhat
                    similar arrangements. I think the bulk of the people in the R Area were civil
                    servants. Some of them had been inherited from the OSS' Research and Analysis
                    staff, and others had gone over to CIA when it was established.</p>
                <p>When the Eisenhower administration came in, with Dulles and his team, I think
                    there was some feeling - I think Under Secretary Loy Henderson, who of course
                    was a career Foreign Service Officer, had a strong feeling - that there ought to
                    be essentially a single personnel system in the State Department, and that
                    people who worked there, with the exception maybe of the Legal Advisor's Office
                    and some other places such as the library, should be within the Foreign Service
                    system.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>The Wriston Commission (named for its chairman, Dr. Henry Wriston, the President
                    of Brown University) made its report in 1954. It recommended that the two
                    services, Civil Service and Foreign Service, should be integrated. The idea
                    generally was to offer opportunities for integration into the Foreign Service to
                    people in Civil Service status, not only in INR but elsewhere in the Department.
                    I think this might have involved some slight loss in grade and pay level, but
                    essentially they would be in the same career level. Then with some additional
                    training, it would be called “lateral entry”, and with overseas service, as was
                    the vogue and the pattern in the Foreign Service. There was a lot of push to get
                    moving on this process in order to get this consolidation. While they understood
                    that this might be difficult for some individuals, or that they might may not be
                    qualified, for whatever reason - health, or maybe other standards that had to be
                    met for Foreign Service Officer positions - the Department leadership felt that
                    the overall pattern ought to be moving toward a single personnel system. Well,
                    many people chose integration, including some from the Division that I was in,
                    including some of the senior people, one or two who had served in Moscow.</p>
                <p>But there were some who didn't integrate, and I didn't join the Foreign Service
                    then for essentially personal reasons. I had been away from my parents, my
                    family, for six years after the family was divided in the late 1930s, and I was
                    at school in England. I finally rejoined them in 1944, and almost immediately I
                    went into the Army for two years in the Pacific theater and then back to Europe.
                    I just felt that I shouldn't to be in a position where I was going to go abroad
                    for lengthy periods of time again. In addition, my wife was professionally
                    active as well as politically active, and I felt that she should be able to
                    pursue her career. Those essentially were the reasons why I chose to remain in
                    the Civil Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was a discrimination [against
                        those who chose to remain civil servants]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, it was made clear that it would be best for people making that
                    choice to get out of the State Department and find other employment. I mean the
                    pressures were not overt, but you could sense that that was the preference, and
                    it came from on high. I think Under Secretary Henderson was the main source of
                    it. I think the Director of INR (I don't recall whether it was still called the
                    R Area) was himself a senior career Foreign Service Officer, and he had a lot of
                    sympathy with the idea of having an integrated system. In INR this also meant
                    that Foreign Service specialists, expertand sometimes maybe not even very expert
                    - would take positions in INR just as a matter of regular rotation and
                    assignment. There was a long-time Deputy Director, Allan Evans, who was getting
                    on in age-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: ?and I don't think he chose lateral entry, but several of the
                    Division chiefs did. So yes, it was suggested that those who didn't choose to
                    join the Foreign Service - I think they were called “indigestible” - that I was
                    among those, and I should consider maybe finding some work elsewhere. But the
                    pressure didn't bother me. I'd been subjected to all sorts of pressures in my
                    young life-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -before that time, so I was fairly sturdy in that regard. But then
                    these various security allegations came up, that I mentioned in our
                    conversations before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It wasn't clear to me whether that was part of the pressure-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -or what exactly was going on. I didn't know what was going to
                    happen on that, because whatever I knew about the security allegations, they
                    were phony. You know, there was somebody who had a grievance of some sort, or
                    was a professional denouncer, who was evidently behind this. So the combination
                    of the “Wristonization” business - this purification, as it were, of the State
                    Department personnel system - and these periodic indications that there were
                    some security concerns about my activities and conduct made it a not terribly
                    pleasant place to be.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I decided to stay, although I toyed with the idea of looking at
                    other jobs. For the next few years, it also meant that the promotions weren't
                    coming, that they sort of dragged their feet. I'd had one promotion after coming
                    in as a GS-7 in 1952. I think the starting wage was $4,200, and I had risen to
                    the rank of a GS-9, which paid about $5,000. So it wasn't all that easy, for
                    example, as far as having children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I got married in 1953, and we wanted to start a family. My morale
                    wasn't the greatest, and somewhere in my files there are some draft letters of
                    resignation, and I looked around. But anyway, it ended up that I stuck it out.
                    Somewhere along the line, the heat was taken off, although not completely, on
                    this lateral entry business; and I got another promotion. And I kept plugging
                    away at my research activities in the field of Soviet affairs and particularly,
                    Soviet foreign policy, and had acquired a certain amount of status and
                    reputation as doing well.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, above me and alongside me, people were starting to move into the
                    Foreign Service and get foreign assignments. By that time, I had been there
                    three, four, five years, and a lot of crises were going on with the Soviet
                    Union, and various other activities. The institutional memory I had accumulated
                    was helpful in turning out assessments in the Research Area and in dealing with
                    other parts of the intelligence community, mostly CIA for National Intelligence
                    Estimates and some other joint products. But there was a lot of personnel
                    movement. Eventually it settled down, and I didn't regret having made the choice
                    to stay as a civil servant.</p>
                <p>We had two children by the late '50s [and a third in 1963]. In addition to the
                    children, my wife was active in her professional work. I got involved more and
                    more in interesting undertakings on the policy side, because they wanted
                    judgment and advice on what the Soviets were up to, or what I thought the
                    Soviets were up to - nobody knew for sure! I got involved in some interesting
                    international conferences, serving on the American delegations as a specialist
                    or expert on Soviet intentions. I eventually became a Branch Chief.</p>
                <p>The longer-term question regarding INR remains to this day: that is, just exactly
                    how it fits into the State Department. How significant is its output, which may
                    become an input into the policy making-process, even though there are now lots
                    of Foreign Service people now who have plenty of informal contacts-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -in the policy bureaus of the State Department. I confess I haven't
                    kept up with it in detail. But I know, from friends who have been Directors or
                    Assistant Secretaries in INR, that a great deal depends on the Secretary of
                    State - how much he or she really wants this kind of input, especially if it
                    doesn't exactly fit with his or her preconceptions; or if sometimes the
                    judgments that come out of INR don't necessarily support a particular line of
                    policy, and suggest some of the negatives that might result from a particular
                    line of policy. Just as we speak, we've had a resignation of the Assistant
                    Secretary of INR, although maybe for other reasons-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stapleton Roy, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, which I think, in part at least, reflects this ambiguity (I
                    don't know the precise reasons; he was going to retire anyway). There have been
                    other Directors or Assistant Secretaries that had close relationships on the
                    policy side. I think, also, over the years, this rather thick wall between
                    research and policy - that is, the effort to keep research objective, policy-
                    oriented but not policy-directed - was hard to maintain. The idea was that the
                    analysts in INR and CIA and other places are supposed to call the shots as they
                    see them, whether this helps an advocacy for a particular policy or doesn't.
                    Sometimes this causes irritation among policy- makers. INR, after all, was part
                    of the State Department; the researchers were supposed to be loyal supporters of
                    policy, once it was decided. Well, they weren't, in the sense of automatically
                    accepting all the premises and assumptions. In my time in INR, there were many
                    differences with Vietnam policy, or at least with assumptions about Hanoi's
                    goals, capabilities and endurance. But most of it was kept out of the media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, of course, in objective terms, that should be
                        the role they would play.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. So, you know, it wasn't always possible, and because, in
                    effect, once you got more Foreign Service people in INR who were policy people,
                    and tried to make them into sort of virgin analysts who had no policy
                    preferences?[it was more difficult to maintain the wall of separation between
                    research and policy].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's not easy, you know; it's not easy to do! So this kind of
                    ambivalence, I think has persisted. I don't know that it's a great liability,
                    but INR always struggles for its budget. It does some other things in helping
                    the State Department coordinate with other agencies in intelligence matters, and
                    it processes sensitive intelligence, and briefs the senior people in the
                    Department, and so on; so it has some other functions. The analytical and
                    judgmental aspects of its work, the estimative assessment aspects of its work,
                    maintain, as best as I can tell, a high quality; but it's not always clear just
                    how much impact it has on the policy process, which ultimately is the
                    purpose-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: While you are not making policy, you are supposed to help
                    policy-makers be as informed as possible and to have as many judgments available
                    as possible so that they can then reach their conclusions as to what ought to be
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also, it serves in a way as a filter or a
                        synthesizer from the output of the CIA -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which tends to maybe put undue weight on clandestine
                        material or </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right. I mean, the CIA has had their own problems as to
                    whether they ought to be objective judges, or mainly provide an input to the
                    main operational business of that agency, which is clandestine operations. It's
                    a complicated issue. In any event, I think that's about the best I can do on
                    “Wristonization,” which is now close to 50 years behind us.</p>
                <p>I still think the intelligence analysts should have an input to policy-makers
                    and, as long as they keep it quiet, ought not to be penalized. Incidentally,
                    when I headed the Soviet office, I used to tell my staff not to become
                    predictable but to exercise their judgment on a case-by-case basis.
                    Predictability, I said, was a prescription for becoming irrelevant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. All right. Well, then you were in arms control for a
                        relatively short time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, well, now let me go on to that because it's not unrelated to
                    what we've been talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Part of my functions or responsibilities in my job in INR was to
                    keep close tabs on Soviet disarmament policy, and to watch carefully what they
                    said and what they wrote, and also their behavior, mostly from a distance, in
                    various of the UN disarmament forums when there were negotiations going on. They
                    still were negotiations mostly about words because in those days there wasn't
                    much real concrete arms control in treaties. There were a couple of negotiations
                    that I was involved in on the analytical side in the mid-'50s, and they were
                    actually concrete.</p>
                <p>One was the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in
                    Vienna, which was given international supervision over what was called peaceful
                    cooperation in the sphere of atomic energy. The Soviets were very much involved
                    in that. The idea was to prevent the diversion of materials and technologies
                    from the so-called peaceful side to the military side. There were all kinds of
                    safeguards built into the IAEA charter. The Soviets were quite interested; in
                    fact, they helped initiate what became Article 11 in the charter. This was
                    something I tracked closely. U.S. and Soviet interests mostly overlapped.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Also in the mid-1950s, there was a treaty demilitarizing Antarctica, which was
                    not trivial because it-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, and it worked!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And it worked, and it has worked and continued to work. It was
                    actually quite path-breaking in many ways. So there were some things that don't
                    have much place in the history of disarmament because they didn't deal with
                    missiles and aircraft and numbers of atomic weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but it shows there were areas of agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There were some areas of agreement. And the IAEA remains a major
                    mechanism for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, although not
                    always effective.</p>
                <p>The rest of the efforts, however, had to do mostly with verbiage and posturing in
                    order to gain international political advantage. The Soviets had the peace
                    movement which they manipulated, and for that purpose they felt it necessary to
                    make these grandiose disarmament proposals every year at the UN. Everybody pored
                    over the texts to see if there was some little change there that maybe opened
                    things up. But we were not really negotiating what later did become arms control
                    arrangements - that is, very concrete measures that would actually be
                    implemented. But anyway, for my sins, I became an expert on these matters as far
                    as Soviet positions and writings and activities were concerned; and also because
                    of that, I kept up with what the U.S. was doing in this field.</p>
                <p>Actually, in the Kennedy administration there was the agreement after the Cuban
                    missile crisis on the Limited Test Ban Treaty. The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty talks
                    had a precursor in 1958 of a technical conference of scientists to look at what
                    an inspection and control system would look like in the event there was a test
                    ban. It was scientific, but on the political side it gave a bit of a push to
                    what had been mostly propagandistic negotiations in the early and mid-'50s on a
                    nuclear weapons test ban. Then in the Kennedy administration, the test ban got a
                    major push in 1963.</p>
                <p>There was concern about surprise attack in both the U.S. and the USSR. The U.S.
                    still very much carried the Pearl Harbor attack in its mind. The Soviets had
                    historic fears of attack, reinforced by their ideology. After 1957, as the
                    Soviets got more and more strategic weapons (aircraft as well as missiles),
                    there was growing concern in this country as to our vulnerabilities, and the
                    doctrine of deterrence was developed.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>In late 1958, I attended a conference in Geneva involving the U.S., the Soviets,
                    the British, French, Italians and Canadians, on the prevention of the dangers of
                    surprise attack. It brought together not only officials involved in these
                    traditional and rather abortive grandiose disarmament negotiations, but
                    strategists and people who were seriously worried about surprise attack. Some
                    came from the RAND Corporation and various other think-tanks. I learned a lot at
                    that conference about those aspects of what came to be called strategic
                    stability and deterrence doctrine. Eventually, there also were more and more
                    direct but semi-official contacts between the U.S. and the Sovietamong
                    academics, think-tank people, and academies of science. This was started up in
                    the late '50s.</p>
                <p>Well, in the presidential campaign of 1960 -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Nixon versus Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, Nixon versus Kennedy. Kennedy and other Democrats made a big
                    issue of the fact that we weren't doing enough to try to stop the arms race and
                    prevent some disaster just through the sheer accumulation of more and more
                    weapons. They said the Eisenhower administration had really not done very well
                    in this, and there should have been more creativitalthough, as I pointed out,
                    there were, in fact but very quietly, some non-trivial contacts with the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: At some point, President Eisenhower decided that to meet some of
                    this criticism and, I guess, to help Nixon meet it, there ought to be a separate
                    organization in the government to deal with disarmament. So by Executive Order
                    in October of 1960, pretty close to election time, he established the U.S.
                    Disarmament Administration. It would have required legislation, which couldn't
                    be passed at that time, to establish it as a separate agency, so it was
                    established within the State Department, but as a sort of autonomous agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The feeling at the time was that the politics were such
                        that if you tried to put it through Congress, you couldn't </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, you couldn't, and it wouldn't even have been wise, in my
                    view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But anyway, they were scrounging around the government to find some
                    people that they could put into this new Disarmament Administration, because
                    they wanted it to start up and be visible, maybe even before election day; but
                    even beyond that, disarmament policy-making was diffused around the government
                    -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eisenhower in his farewell address had shown that he was
                        concerned about the military establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, he had been for a long time, and he chose his farewell address
                    to warn about the growing influence of the “military-industrial complex.” But
                    anyway, there were people scattered around different agencies that staffed these
                    various conferences that I've referred to, and did some policy-making for
                    instructions to American negotiators or participants in the conferences. There
                    were some in the State Department, some in the Defense Department and some
                    people in the CIA who did much the same sort of work that we had been doing in
                    INR, which was tracking Soviet policy, but also working with people that
                    followed very closely Soviet military developments, which obviously were a major
                    ingredient of all of this. This also involved the Russians' shooting-down of the
                    U-2 (Utility-2, jet powered reconnaissance plane), which also happened in
                    1960-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It led to a rather hairy period in American-Soviet relations, when
                    U-2 pilot Francis GarPowers was shot down over the USSR and was tried by the
                    Soviets, who also captured much of the U-2's special equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which caused the Paris summit meeting between Khrushchev
                        and Eisenhower [to be aborted]-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. Precisely. Anyway, I was told that I would be assigned to the
                    U.S. Disarmament Administration. I didn't particularly care for this because I
                    didn't think disarmament was headed anywhere very much, other than a lot of
                    words being ground out in different communiqu�s and statements. Essentially I
                    was told, “This is your assignment, and you'd better go!” In fact, the old
                    security business cropped up again. I don't know whether Hugh Cumming, the
                    Director of INR, was still in place, but whoever it was, in effect said, “Well,
                    you've been told, 'This is where you're going,' and if you don't go there, maybe
                    you're not going anywhere.” Perhaps it wasn't that blunt.</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: It turned out that the SY (State Department's Office of Security)
                    people, who were periodically listening to my telephone calls, heard one in
                    which I was complaining to a friend of mine that I was being assigned over there
                    even though I didn't really think very much of the prospects of disarmament; and
                    I wasn't sure whether this was a way of getting rid of me once again in INR, or
                    whether they really wanted someone that?anyway, so I ended up over there. Ed
                    Gullion, a prominent career guy, was the temporary head of it at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went rather quickly to Africa, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, later he became the first U.S. Ambassador to the Congo. He had
                    been somewhat involved in disarmament negotiations, but also in Vietnam, and he
                    had had a varied career, and was well-connected. We got started trying to do
                    something about U.S. disarmament policy. Then the election came, and Kennedy was
                    elected. Gullion knew Kennedy socially, as he knew just about everybody else in
                    town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He was told to keep the effort going because the Kennedy people had
                    raised this whole issue in the first place - that there were thousands, tens of
                    thousands, hundreds of thousands, [of] people working on war and only fewer than
                    a hundred on peace; and so this was the U.S. Disarmament Administration. Kennedy
                    was quite interested in it right from the start. The idea developed in the
                    transition period before Kennedy's inauguration that relations with the Soviets
                    were bad because of the U-2 and some other things, and that we really needed to
                    find a way to get a new disarmament forum going again with the Soviets, to pick
                    up some of the threads that had been tattered in the previous year. John McCloy
                    was brought in to head thDisarmament Administration after the inauguration in
                    1961, and I guess Gullion stayed with him for awhile and then eventually
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. John McCloy was one of the sort of the grand men of
                        the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: “Grand old men of the establishment.” He was the head of “the
                    establishment,” in some people's views. He'd been the U.S. High Commissioner in
                    postwar Germany, and had lots of experience in World War II in the War
                    Department. He was prominent and prestigious, and even though he was a
                    Republican, he was nonpartisan in his government service. His task was not only
                    to see if something could get re-started with the Soviets in terms of
                    disarmament talks, but also to establish a permanent Arms Control Agency. So he
                    rather enjoyed that.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>The first thing that happened after the Kennedy inauguration was that McCloy was
                    told to go to Moscow with a team and meet with the Soviets to see if we could
                    create some new forum (the old UN forums had broken down), and also work out a
                    general basis for such a forum - that is, not exactly a charter, but a sort of
                    substantive basis for what this new forum, which would still be under the UN,
                    would be doing, with an agenda for them to negotiate. So he took me along in the
                    group (he knew me somewhat from some other contacts).</p>
                <p>Needless to say, for me, going to Moscow for the first time in 1961, after having
                    worked on the Soviet Union for almost 10 years, was a great fascination. McCloy
                    also took along some people that he had brought in, and some other experienced
                    people from the government, among them Adrian “Butch” Fisher, who had been the
                    State Department Legal Advisor in the Truman administration. It was quite a
                    potent delegation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There were also a couple of newcomers, young people who came into
                    the Kennedy administration at fairly high levels, who thought they were going to
                    save the world, but didn't quite fit into the work-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As with every new administration, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. But a couple of them didn't quite fit into the daily grind, and
                    I think they were politely asked to go back home and assume their new positions
                    at home. So the delegation took a little while to get trimmed down to the right
                    size. We had these very intensive talks with the Soviets about a general
                    statement on the goals of disarmament. It involved a lot of haggling because the
                    Soviets had a long history of advocating general and complete disarmament of
                    everything, but they were very short on how you would inspect and control
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So it went on and on and on. Also, of course, since the late '50s,
                    we in fact had been in a Berlin crisis because Khrushchev had proposed
                    establishing West Berlin as a free city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, oh, yes. It was a very serious one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It became more and more serious because prestige was involved in the
                    Soviet case; and of course, there was complete resistance to this in West Berlin
                    and Germany. With the Kennedy inauguration, the Soviets didn't let up, and
                    Kennedy felt tested early on in his administration. There was a general theory
                    that that's what Soviets do with new presidents anyway, to see what kind of a
                    person they had to deal with. So John McCloy, with his German experience, was
                    also instructed after we got there, by Kennedy personally and, I guess, by
                    Secretary of State Dean Rusk, to go talk to Khrushchev about the Berlin
                    business, and to warn him that if there was going to be any pressure or any
                    unilateral action, that would be very serious. Actually, while we were there,
                    Kennedy issued an order to mobilize 150,000 troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Yes, I remember - It was?the public feeling was
                        involved. This was a serious time!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. I wasn't so much involved in the Berlin thing, but McCloy
                    eventually ended up having a meeting with Khrushchev in the Crimea, where
                    Khrushchev was vacationing. We were there in the wintertime. So this was a good
                    experience for me, to have hands-on contacts with Soviet officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling of sort of coming face to face with
                        the Soviets on their own home ground?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, you know, I'd seen a little bit of this at the Surprise Attack
                    conference in Geneva; and, also, back in the Eisenhower administration, I'd gone
                    with Harold Stassen for two years in a row to London, where this UN disarmament
                    committee was meeting. A senior diplomat named Valerian Zorin headed the Soviet
                    delegation. (He became famous in the Cuban missile crisis, when he was the
                    Soviet UN representative.) I met a lot of younger Russians, Soviets, who were on
                    that team, who later became very senior people in the Foreign Ministry. So it
                    was interesting to me to see some real Soviets in the flesh. I had met some when
                    I was stationed in Germany in the Army as a CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps)
                    agent right on the border with the Soviet zone, and we had some liaison with the
                    Soviets. But this was for me extremely helpful to see these people in the flesh,
                    and to listen to them and get acquainted with them and see something about their
                    style and mentality, because I really hadn't been exposed a whole lot to
                    that.</p>
                <p>Well, the long and short of that is that eventually we came up with an idea of
                    what a new forum would look like. It would be enlarged to have more members from
                    the Third World. The Soviets didn't just want to confront four Western powers,
                    as they had been doing in the five-power Disarmament Committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>That was related to another thing that created a crisis in 1960. Khrushchev
                    wanted to have three Secretaries-General of the UN in order to prevent the West
                    constantly putting a new guy in there and dominating the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Troika.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. He blocked the UN for a long time; and there was a Congo
                    crisis in the 1960s, which got the Soviets and us pitted against each other. It
                    was kind of a tough period. But anyway, we reached a compromise on what a
                    disarmament forum might look like. This had to be approved by the UN General
                    Assembly (UNGA) in due course. And we also eventually agreed on a big, long
                    document on general and complete disarmament, which we haggled out word for word
                    and sentence for sentence. Arthur Dean got involved in this because McCloy was
                    concentrating more and more on getting this new agency established, which
                    eventually happeneit became the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.</p>
                <p>That's another thing. There were people on the Hill who thought the whole
                    disarmament business was kooky and might lead to unilateral disarmament, and
                    what we really needed was to control arms rather than to talk about general and
                    complete disarmament. So the compromise name for this agency was the Arms
                    Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I had by that time become one of two or three policy officers in
                    what was still called USDA (Disarmament Administration). I left behind my pure
                    analytical and research role and mentality. It was interesting to devise policy
                    approaches and how to implement them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, I mean, looking at it, sort of putting on
                        your personal INR hat, were we headed towards anything? I mean the United
                        States. Was this a holding operation, or was there a feeling that, you know,
                        maybe this will get somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I don't know. I didn't have a feeling like that. There were
                    some very devoted disarmament people who had been at it since the Baruch Plan
                    [1946 plan presented to President Truman]. There was a fellow named Bob Matteson
                    who was very close to Harold Stassen. Stassen, of course, was also rather
                    committed to the prospects of disarmament. He got in a big fight with Secretary
                    of State Dulles because Stassen just lurched ahead of government positions and
                    caused a big uproar in Europe in 1958, the spring of '58. I thought this arms
                    control effort was going to be a very long haul in terms of really getting
                    something concrete that meant anything, and it all was happening in the context
                    of pretty multifaceted strains in U.S.-Soviet relations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kennedy had had a two-day summit meeting with Khrushchev in June of
                    1960, and it went badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Vienna, and it went very badly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Of course, Khrushchev tried to bully him, or fool him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Certainly on Berlin. We were also beginning to have problems,
                    serious problems over Laos, involving also the Chinese. We hadn't really quite
                    caught on yet to the fact that the Sino-Soviet relationship wasn't what it
                    looked to be at the superficial level. It was not a time to have much hope that
                    things would move on agreed disarmament. On the contrary, they all seemed to be
                    moving in the opposite direction. But they did have some general talk on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>There are many other things that happened in this time period that I think, in
                    retrospect, were seminal in leading to the eventual collapse of the Soviet
                    Union. These are afterthoughts of mine, reflections that I put together
                    recently. Somebody wanted me to reflect on that time in government, in the
                    context of my getting an award from my university as an alumnus.</p>
                <p>The sixties were an interesting and fascinating period, but also quite ambiguous.
                    There was this business of talking to the Soviets about disarmament; and the
                    U.S. was on the verge of installing a significant bureaucratic institution for
                    just this subject for a time when things might look less troubling and less
                    dangerous.</p>
                <p>But Kennedy had campaigned against Nixon and Eisenhower in 1960 on the basis that
                    there was a so-called “bomber gap” and a “missile gap”. He called for the
                    country to get moving again, not only in the domestic area and in terms of its
                    prestige around the world, but also in not letting the Soviets get ahead of us.
                    They had launched Sputnik [the first satellite sent into space], and had tested
                    some intercontinental ballistic missiles. The USSR had also broken a nuclear
                    test moratorium, and they were testing nuclear weapons again. So while McCloy
                    and others were supposed to get moving on the arms control side, there were a
                    lot of belligerence and dangers at the same time. The Kennedy people found out
                    after they got into the government that there really wasn't a gap, and if there
                    was any gap at all, it was in our favor. Khrushchev had been bluffing.</p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Later in 1961, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. Roswell
                    Gilpatrick, was sent out to make a speech to tell the American people, and
                    everybody else who wanted to listen, including the Soviets, that the fact was
                    that we were better off than had been thought, and that we were really moving
                    ahead of the Soviets, both in numbers and in quality of missiles. I think this
                    is one of the reasons that eventually led Khrushchev to deploy some missiles in
                    Cuba that could reach much of the U.S. The truth was that the Soviets did not
                    have the resources to race us in intercontinental missiles, though eventually
                    they did that, at great cost.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So, there was a lot going on. But, back to ACDA: eventually a draft
                    statute was put together and sent up to the Hill, which made some amendments and
                    added the phrase, “Arms Control.” Congress also wanted to create an advisory
                    committee for this Arms Control Agency to make sure that it wouldn't just be
                    staffed by a bunch of strange people-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peaceniks [laughter].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Peaceniks?I don't know if the word was yet invented-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: ?but anyway, there were people who were obsessed with guilt because
                    of Hiroshima, and so on. Congress wanted to have a rather tough man, not exactly
                    as a supervisor, but a monitor of what the agency was doing. That was all put
                    into this statute. I think by October 1961 or so, the Arms Control Agency was
                    established by Congress.</p>
                <p>Mr. William Foster, a very prominent, respected Republican and a former
                    industrialist who'd been in the Defense Department, was the first head of the
                    Agency. His appointment was a way for Kennedy to tell the more skeptical
                    Republicans that he had two tough guys in this arms control business. John
                    McCloy was made the head of this advisory group, the General Advisory
                    Committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>In the meantime, a friend of mine, Roger Hilsman, had become head of INR. He
                    approached me and asked me whether I didn't want to come back to INR. I figured
                    that that's where I really still belonged. I had enjoyed the experience of being
                    in a more policy-oriented job, and also being more exposed to high-level
                    Soviets. I think in October or November of 1961, I went back to INR, with a
                    promotion and a rather friendly and sympathetic Director and a Deputy Director,
                    Thomas Hughes, who later became Director when Hilsman became Assistant Secretary
                    for Asian affairs.</p>
                <p>They were all people that I knew. They also finally forced a resolution of the
                    security allegations that were still there somewhere in the files, and that
                    re-appeared occasionally. They arranged for me, finally, to be interviewed and
                    confronted with what I was being charged with by Otto Otepka and the Security
                    Bureau. The SY people gave me that lie detector test, and the upshot of it was
                    that eventually I was cleared. I mean, you never get permanently cleared, and I
                    guess some of that stuff still remained in my files. In those days, you didn't
                    have legislation that enabled you to look at your own files and insist on their
                    being purged of [false information]. [end of tape]</p>
                <p>My work in INR, as it had in ACDA or USDA, involved military issues and military
                    clearances. There was a panel in the Defense Department which included Assistant
                    Secretary Paul Nitze (who knew me personally); and Adam Yarmolinsky, who was
                    close to Defense Secretary Bob McNamara; and a third person. They went though
                    all the security allegations against me and, in effect, said there was no
                    substance that they could find. So I had all the clearances, and that really put
                    me on a path in INR to move up. I became a Division Chief. By that time, INR had
                    been reorganized, and what used to be a Division became an Office, and what used
                    to be an Area became a Bureau, and so on. So 1961 really began a period in which
                    I was able to build on my experiences, and I had a good career in INR through
                    the rest of the decade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll go to this, but one question, so I don't forget it.
                        You went to the Soviet Union for the first time; and one of the things
                        that's always struck me is that everybody, almost everybody, who went to the
                        Soviet Union saw the Soviet Union, and the [system, the whole] thing didn't
                        work. But we tended to build it up. I mean there was obviously the military
                        side. What was your, sort of, what were you coming back with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In 1961, the McCloy delegation had our own airplane, and we were
                    greeted, treated as VIPs, and had motorcycle cops and limousines and all that
                    stuff. I can't remember now whether most of us stayed in a Russian hotel or
                    whether we were housed at the American Embassy apartments. I know McCloy stayed
                    at Spaso House [the American Embassy residence] with the Ambassador, Tommy
                    Thompson. Anyway, the city looked pretty dilapidated coming in from the airport.
                    I forget the details now because I was subsequently in Moscow so many times with
                    visiting American delegations and VIP treatment, and we were put up in “dachas”
                    (guest houses) in the Lenin Hills.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Moscow looked pretty run-down; but it was also clear that VIPs, including, of
                    course, most of the Soviet leaders, didn't have to put up with a lot of this
                    inconvenience. They were driven down the center of the roads; there weren't all
                    that many cars, but mostly trucks there. I must have stayed on my first visit at
                    the Ukraina Hotel, where the water didn't flush, and where there was just a tiny
                    little bit of soap, and the towels were ragged, and so on. We're talking about
                    40 years ago now, roughly. The U.S. was also in a different phase of development
                    then, and we saw some fairly primitive things in this country, but there was
                    just no comparison, just in terms of the general things one saw there: the fact
                    that lots of people were on bicycles, and the long lines at shops. But it was
                    also clear that there were class distinctions, that there were places, like the
                    National Hotel, where the ordinary people weren't allowed and where there were
                    some better-dressed and groomed people. The boom in hotel construction happened
                    later. I think the fact that there was a distinction between a small, elite
                    group of people and the vast bulk of the rest of the population in a place like
                    Moscow bore in on you very quickly, and the generally dilapidated
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>I don't know that that changed my view as to the nature of what might constitute
                    the threat from the Soviet Union, because I had been reading much material which
                    indicated that they were putting all their best resources into military power,
                    and that the consumer and the average people were several levels below that, in
                    terms of attention by this workers' and peasants' state that they talked about.
                    Of course, there was some beginning recognition in the Khrushchev period that
                    things needed to be tended to in the Soviet Union - well, he was bluffing mostly
                    on the military side, because I think they had really come to recognize that,
                    despite all the hoopla and their great, much-publicized activities in space,
                    they were falling behind, and they had to do something about that somehow. But
                    all of that emerged more clearly after the Cuban missile crisis, when things
                    improved a bit in relations with the U.S. for a little while.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're back in INR. When did you come back in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think it was October or November o'61. As soon as ACDA went into
                    business I went back there?I'll just mention one thing if you've got a
                    moment-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: One thing I did do: a teaching job became vacant at the Johns
                    Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SAIS.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: SAIS, where I'd been a student, and where I'd met Mose Harvey, my
                    eventual boss in the State Department, who taught a course on Soviet foreign
                    policy. Then, when Mose was “Wristonized” and sent abroad, his Deputy, Boris
                    Klosson, took over teaching that course. Then Boris was “Wristonized” and sent
                    abroad; and I was approached by the Dean to see if I would like to teach the
                    course at SAIS on Soviet foreign policy. I started doing that in 1957, in the
                    evenings once a week. The State Department had no objection to this at all. It
                    does now and had subsequently, but at that time, they said, “No problem - just
                    don't use classified information.”</p>
                <p>I agreed. We all used the FBIS (Foreign Broadcast Information Service)
                    unclassified books of translated Soviet and East European media. I had this
                    teaching position for what turned out to be 13 years, until I went to the White
                    House and just couldn't manage it all. That helped me enormously in terms of
                    keeping up with the academic literature. It was great for me to see young
                    people, some of whom later came into the government, including the State
                    Department, and I really enjoyed that. Actually, I think it helped my work in
                    the government because I was just forced, even though I read a whole lot of
                    stuff, to broaden my vision and connections in the field a bit to people who
                    were real scholars, which I had no pretense of being. I frequently asked the
                    students to write two-page memos on an issue or event in the news. One of my
                    motives was to teach students likely to join the State Department some day how
                    to write crisp reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excellent. All right. Well, we'll pick this up next
                        time?1961, and you're back in INR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>

                        again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I am in INR again. I'd been in ACDA (the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency) with McCloy; and then, when the statute that set up the U.S.
                    Disarmament Administration was passed, I went back to INR when Roger Hilsman,
                    the new INR Director, asked me to come back. I returned to the same Soviet-East
                    European Office that I had been in. I can't remember now whether I went back as
                    a Branch Chief or as a Division Chief, but anyway dealing with Soviet foreign
                    policy and also with Eastern Europe. It must have been some time after the
                    summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, right. You were doing it from '61 to about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I stayed there until I went to the White House, the National
                    Security Council staff, on January 21, 1969, although actually I started working
                    in the transition for several weeks before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let's talk about '61. First place, let's talk sort
                        of internally. Did you sense a different mood, use of INR? I mean Roger
                        Hilsman came and was very much a Kennedy man and activist and all that, and
                        did you-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, he certainly was an activist and was well connected in the
                    Kennedy administration. I don't know how well acquainted he was, if at all, with
                    Secretary of State Dean Rusk. He actually may have known him because Rusk had
                    been in the State Department in the Truman administration, and Roger may have
                    been around then. Anyway, he was well-connected; and he certainly wanted to have
                    a voice in policy, not so much as a policy-maker, although at heart that's what
                    he wanted to be, but in having a product from INR that was relevant and
                    responsive to the needs of the policy people, including the policy people at the
                    top. And yes, that mood transmitted itself, at least to the Soviet office but
                    also to the body of INR. Then of course, Vietnam and Southeast Asia became more
                    and more a U.S. concern; and more U.S. involvement ensued from that. The
                    Research Office dealing with Asia later became very much tied into the
                    policy-making process and into the debates about our policy toward Vietnam. Then
                    Hilsman, himself, eventually went on to become the Assistant Secretary for
                    Asian, Far Eastern Affairs, whatever the bureau was called. [the current title
                    is now Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, at the beginning of '61 relations weren't great
                        with the Soviet Union. I mean, you'd had that sort of disastrous Vienna
                        meeting with Kennedy and Khrushchev; and the Berlin issue - would there be a
                        peace treaty and all - was heating up, and that. I mean the reserves were
                        called out, and I'm-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There was all of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been, as you were looking at this, there
                        must have been a lot of figuring out. I mean what are we facing now, I mean
                        with Khrushchev?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I think that the Kennedy administration came in very much
                    concerned with our relations with the Soviets and very much concerned about our
                    not doing as well as we should. In the campaign in 1960, Kennedy raised
                    questions about a “missile gap” and a “bomber gap”. The idea of getting America
                    moving again was central to Kennedy's programs - at least they thought it was a
                    good political tack to take - but their perception was that we were in serious
                    difficulty with the Soviets. The Berlin crisis had been going on, and we had
                    earlier in 1960 the U-2 episode. So relations were in pretty bad shape. Also,
                    somebody showed John Kennedy a long speech that Khrushchev gave at an
                    international Communist movement meeting in, I think, October of 1960, a very
                    famous speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the Twentieth Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, the 20th Soviet Party Congress was in 1956, when Khrushchev's
                    secret speech acknowledged Stalin's crimes. The speech I referred to was
                    delivered at a gathering of the international Communist movement that met
                    periodically. It increasingly had become a forum for Soviet and Chinese dispute,
                    and eventually more than dispute on just theoretical grounds. But Khrushchev
                    made a long speech in which he talked extensively about wars of national
                    liberation. Kennedy had made his principal cabinet people - not only those
                    dealing with foreign and security questions - read that speech by Khrushchev
                    because he thought that was going to be the key problem, in addition to the
                    threat of missiles, that we were going to have to face.</p>
                <p>The speech suggested a Soviet push, and at that time it was still believed to be
                    a Sino-Soviet push, to contest the United States all around the world, including
                    in Southeast Asia. The Administration then produced programs which Averil
                    Harriman was put in charge of, for counter-insurgency traininit wasn't called
                    counter-terrorism, that's the term we use now. This was very much in the mix in
                    the Kennedy administration.</p>
                <p>Some of us felt that Khrushchev's speech might actually have as much to do with
                    the emerging contest with China as with a threat and challenge on a global basis
                    to the United States. The Russians and the Chinese were beginning to contest
                    each other for leadership in the international Communist movement, and in the
                    Third Worlin Africa and elsewhere. But in Kennedy's view, Khrushchev's speech
                    represented a big challenge and was sort of a “Mein Kampf.” I remember that
                    Secretary of Defense Bob McNamara read the speech, and there was also an article
                    in the Communist Party's main political journal. It was widely considered to be
                    an authoritative policy indicator for the Communists.</p>

                <p>McCloy was sent to Moscow to try to get some disarmament talks going again. They
                    had been disrupted in 1960, when the Soviets had walked out; it was part of
                    Khrushchev's effort to have three Secretary-Generals in the UN, because he felt
                    the one that they had was too pro-American. He wanted UN Committees to be
                    equally composed of pro-Soviet, Western, and third-world members. The U.S. had
                    rejected this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So-called troika.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right. McCloy was sent to see if he could get something
                    started again in disarmament talks. But it was also Berlin crisis time, so
                    McCloy also had instructions to talk to the Soviets about Berlin. This was
                    before the Kennedy-Khrushchev Vienna meeting. McCloy actually saw Khrushchev in
                    the Crimea, and ran into pretty much a stonewall. This coincided with the
                    mobilization of American forces and the call-up of reserves shortly after
                    Kennedy became president. It was a pretty dicey time, or so it seemed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, here you are where the Soviets are up to
                        something, at least in our perspective. I was wondering, you know, I mean
                        you arrived on the scene there. And what, how you perceived it, and
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, in Moscow, I still was in my Disarmament Administration time.
                    We had long talks, basically talks about talks, not about substance, although
                    the words sounded substantive. Something called “general and complete
                    disarmament” was the issue of the period; it was a Soviet term, and, of course,
                    it was completely out of reach. The effort was made to get some kind of a joint
                    U.S.-Soviet statement that would be a broad basis for the next round of meetings
                    on disarmament under UN aegis. Some progress was made on trying to constitute a
                    new forum other than the five-power one that had operated in the '50s, which
                    became four Western powers against the Soviet Union, which they now rejected.
                    They wanted a three-part committee of East, West and in-between. Eventually that
                    was constituted in Geneva. In fact, a descendant of it still functions in Geneva
                    to this day, 2001.</p>
                <p>But it really was not terribly serious. In fact, in some ways it created more
                    tension than progress toward a less strident relationship, because disarmament
                    lends itself to demagogy, to accusations of bad faith, and so on. In those days
                    it really didn't amount to a helluva lot. The meetings were polite enough. It
                    was my first extended experience on the ground in Moscow, which was of interest
                    and instructive for me as a Soviet specialist.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Then there was another issue, which we didn't really realize and get involved in
                    in Moscow or subsequently in the Disarmament Agency. I don't know whether McCloy
                    was fully informed. The point was that Kennedy had been wrong in his 1960
                    judgment that the missile balance and the strategic force balance between the
                    United States and the Soviet Union favored Moscow. The United States was, in
                    fact, in numerical terms and in some qualitative ways, ahead of the Soviets. The
                    Kennedy administration discovered this quite early in the administration. They
                    decided, especially after the Vienna summit meeting (where it was thought that
                    Kennedy had had the worse of it in his encounter with Khrushchev), to go public
                    with a new assessment of the balance in strategic forces. The Deputy Secretary
                    of Defense, Roswell Gilpatrick, was sent out to give a speech in about October
                    of 1961, to say, in effect, “it ain't so.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That speech is on the record. I don't have the details of it in
                    mind, but it was a very important move.</p>
                <p>Now in the meantime, also, in my view at least - and there's some corroborative
                    evidence from witnesses of it - the Soviets, in analyzing the camera they
                    captured when they shot down the U-2 in the spring of 1960, realized the
                    effectiveness of our intelligence collection activities at that time. Nowadays,
                    we'd sneer at it this technology! But still, the resolution of the cameras was,
                    I think, better than the Soviets had expected. I think that Khrushchev and his
                    people began to wonder what we really knew (this is some months before
                    Gilpatrick came out and made his statement on strategic forces). I think the
                    Russians must have figured that these earlier U-2 operations and other American
                    intelligence operations gave us a much more realistic appreciation than what
                    Khrushchev, himself, since 1957 (and a lot of Americans critical of the
                    Eisenhower administration) and others, were saying: namely, that the Soviets
                    were leaping way ahead; and that we were getting into greater and greater
                    danger;. and that we needed to put more money into strategic forces. We had all
                    these civil defense exercises; that went on into the Kennedy administration, for
                    that matter.</p>
                <p>I think this picture - when the Soviets did not get what they had hoped to get by
                    pressure and by their triumphalism over their strategic breakthroughs, Sputnik,
                    and missile tests, and so on - when they did not get what they wanted in Berlin,
                    and various other things that were happening that were not very positive for the
                    Soviets - I think this sowed the seeds for the eventual Khrushchev decision to
                    station missiles in Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That is, they realized that we were not behind, and were probably
                    going to be increasingly ahead in strategic missile forces, and that they would
                    have to add huge amounts of resources to keep up with us, and they would have to
                    greatly improve and increase their production in these fields. I think this is
                    where Khrushchev got the idea that he needed something to threaten the U.S. more
                    directly than he was able to do with his strategic forces - perhaps something
                    like the U.S. did with its intermediate-range missiles in Britain and Italy and
                    Turkey during the time when we did not yet have intercontinental missiles. I
                    don't think all of these things came together that early, certainly not in my
                    mind. But I think it turned out that our relationship, both on the face of it
                    and at some depth, was bad and perhaps even dangerous with the Soviets, because
                    Khrushchev, while putting pressure on Berlin, was not getting what he was
                    looking for, and, in fact, was running risks of war, which basically he didn't
                    want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But he wanted to bluff or utilize the fear of war and the threat of
                    war to squeeze concessions out of the U.S., not only in regard to Berlin, but
                    also on other international issues, from the Congo to wherever. He was also
                    establishing his position in Cuba, right on our doorstep. Now all of this, I
                    think, had a Chinese angle that I've already mentioned: that it wasn't only that
                    he was contesting the U.S., but that he was contesting the Chinese by trying to
                    at least give the appearance of accumulating power and strategic advantage. I
                    think he was getting himself into quite a complex situation. I don't think we
                    realized that at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again. What were we getting in INR? How did you find
                        the information that you were getting about developments in the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The bulk of it was still unclassified information from the
                    literature, their publications, which were assumed to be under strict control
                    and, therefore, some indication of what the regime was doing or wanted to do.
                    Sometimes, when there was a deviation in these ritualistic formulas that they
                    used, it was a question of whether they were deliberately trying to deceive, or
                    to make it appear there was some dispute, or whether there really were some
                    differences among different leaders, who had influence on the different
                    publications. That remained a very big source, as did their broadcasts.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We had the Daily Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS)
                    report, sometimes a half-inch thick, every day for the Soviet Union and their
                    Union Republics and Eastern Europe. These were big sources. Obviously, CIA was
                    doing various things with espionage; some of it has become known. We also had
                    access to a Soviet military journal, Military Thought it was called, through a
                    man who basically got copies of it to us, which our government analyzed very
                    carefully; and we used the RAND Corporation and one or two other outfits that
                    specialized in these areas.</p>
                <p>There were the secret U-2 overflights of the USSR, which produced information.
                    They obviously couldn't penetrate the minds of Soviet leaders, but they could
                    get data on military dispositions and some economic conditions in the Soviet
                    Union. Of course, we had to stop the U-2 flights after they were exposed when
                    Powers was shot down in 1960, but then we began to get satellite intelligence
                    somewhat later. Our sources were a collection of things.</p>
                <p>The State Department and CIA had a program of interviewing people who had been in
                    the Soviet Union: some refugees, some defectors, and others. It was a mix. There
                    were also many levels of security clearance, and very few people actually had
                    all the clearances to put the whole picture together. We had diplomatic contacts
                    with Soviets in various places, at the UN and Geneva, and so on. It was a
                    collection of material, the bulk of which, however, was, in effect, in the
                    public domain. It was just a matter of getting hold of it and collating it, and
                    that took a lot of manpower in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any pressure on INR to come up with a point of
                        view about what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There was always pressure of various kinds; but I think on the
                    whole, people maintained their integrity, whatever pressure was exerted. I think
                    the advent of non-career people, like Hilsman and his Deputy, Tom Hughes, in
                    running INR in the early '60s removed any inclination of senior Foreign Service
                    people - who were assigned to INR for a period of time and then went back to
                    their other assignments - to separate themselves excessively from what was
                    happening in the policy bureaus. For example in my case, we were part of the
                    intelligence community, so we participated in the drafting of National
                    Intelligence Estimates, some of them very long-range and some of them, special
                    ones, geared to a particular crisis situation, whether Berlin, or later Vietnam,
                    or others. While we stayed in touch with the Soviet Desk and with Ambassador
                    Thompson, who was the Secretary of State's Soviet affairs advisor-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tyler Thompson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Llewellyn Thompson.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Llewellyn Thompson, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And also Chip Bohlen, one of the recognized Soviet experts. We
                    stayed in touch with them, but they understood that we were to reach independent
                    judgments, by and large. They didn't always like it. But I made a point
                    (especially when, a few years later, I became head of the Soviet-East European
                    Office, but even in my Division Chief days) to give close attention to what
                    their judgment was on the issues that we were discussing with our intelligence
                    colleagues, but to maintain our independence in the judgments we made. So yes,
                    there was some pressure, mostly indirect.</p>
                <p>In the Vietnam period, the tendency in INR was to be very dubious about what the
                    administration was doing. In the case of Under Secretary George Ball, the
                    in-house critic or devil's advocate (whatever you want to call him, I think it
                    was a matter of conviction, not just lawyerliness), the INR product was very
                    helpful to him because Allen Whiting and some others in that office were very
                    sympathetic. That was their view; and I don't think the top people in INR
                    (Hughes later, Hilsman and Hughes jointly before that) were telling those INR
                    people what to write; and they certainly weren't telling them to accommodate the
                    policy preferences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much consultation, you know, in the early '60s
                        between you dealing with the Soviets and the people who were dealing with
                        the Communist Chinese, I mean, to try to figure out what [was] going on
                        between these two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, you know, the Soviet and the China specialists in INR were in
                    adjacent offices physically on the seventh floor, which was, coincidentally, the
                    floor where the State Department's leaders had their offices. The China
                    specialists followed it closely; and CIA had followed it closely for a long
                    time, and had some very substantial experts. In fact, the first big paper on a
                    Sino-Soviet split, or potential split, or emerging split, was produced at CIA in
                    the Office of Current Intelligence by a man named Donald Zagoria. He became a
                    professor at Columbia. It was a long study, examining in the most meticulous
                    fashion every statement, every utterance, every rumor, every inference. He came
                    up with the proposition that this relationship was not going to be stable and
                    was going to be more and more difficult. That's about 15 years earlier than the
                    time we're talking about.</p>
                <p>Yes, we were keenly interested in the possibility of a split. Of course, by '61,
                    '62, some of this became more and more apparent. In fact, after the Cuban
                    missile crisis, Mao was very critical of Khrushchev's concessions. More and more
                    of this was buried in esoteric publications and utterances, and the rumor mill
                    became more and more obvious and clear. Yes, we were keenly interested.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Now, the policy inferences to be drawn from that weren't, strictly speaking, our
                    business in INR. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and a lot of others were very
                    skeptical about what was being put out on the Sino-Soviet split; they were
                    interested, but they were skeptical. They thought maybe it was a deliberate ploy
                    by the Russians and Chinese to mislead us. Therefore, while we had some contacts
                    with the Chinese - rather formal ones because of various issues about missing
                    people - it wasn't really until Nixon came in that the inferences were drawn
                    from this Sino-Soviet gulf that was widening and deepening every year, that led
                    to the opening to China. But that was ten years later, and it took a Republican
                    president to do it. In the period we're talking about, the early 1960s, it was
                    much more a matter for experts, not only in the government, but there were
                    scholars who were tracking the relationship and were publishing things about it.
                    I think on the whole, the policy people in the Kennedy and Johnson
                    administrations were skeptical about making too much of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who were in Berlin, particularly
                        during the early '60s when the Kennedy administration came in. They were
                        very leery of Kennedy because by this time, we had developed a set of rules
                        on how you handle every - sort of a theology about Berlin. There was a
                        feeling early on that Kennedy's group came in, and they wanted to do
                        something, and they might get soft on Berlin. Was this, you know, I mean
                        this is part of your business as you're looking at the Soviets. I mean, was
                        this a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, Eisenhower carried in his briefcase to the 1960 Paris summit
                    with Khrushchev (which was aborted because of the shooting down of the U-2) some
                    options about Berlin, because that was one of the big issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Some of those options were considered too conciliatory. This had to
                    do with a free city and with access arrangements, and so on. When Khrushchev
                    stomped out of the meeting in Paris, there was some relief among some people who
                    thought that Eisenhower might have gone a little soft if he had met a solid
                    front there from Khrushchev on Berlin issues, because Eisenhower had with him
                    these options that didn't sell out to the Russians, but were somewhat more
                    conciliatory. In regard to Kennedy, there may well have been such suspicions.
                    But what Kennedy actually did was pretty militant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He did some very overt military things, such as calling up reserves
                    and greater readiness, and so on. I think he himself was leery about giving
                    anybody a reason for saying that Democrats are “soft”, and that every war in
                    this century had been started under a Democratic president; and by God if we
                    don't look out, that through weakness, and through giving the wrong signals,
                    we'll get us into another one. Then there was this missile-balance issue that I
                    mentioned: as soon as the President realized that we were, in fact, not in the
                    bad position that he had at least claimed in the campaign, the Kennedy people
                    went public with it, to reinforce confidence and reassure our allies.</p>
                <p>I think Kennedy got something of a bum rap on the Vienna summit with Khrushchev.
                    I wasn't there, but I read the reports they sent back from there, and I think we
                    wrote an analysis in INR. This was fairly routine because, as so often, we
                    weren't there; we didn't meet these people; we didn't see the chemistry. Yes, it
                    was a bad meeting; but the idea that Khrushchev had really kicked Kennedy around
                    and bullied him is a bum rap - he tried, but he didn't stop Kennedy from sending
                    Gilpatrick out to discuss the strategic balance and getting increasingly tougher
                    on Vietnam. Now there are disputes about that among historians, about the
                    results of this phase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In the spring and summer of 1961, Kissinger wrote in the Reporter
                    Magazine very critical articles about the Kennedy administration's position on
                    Berlin, and related it also to the administration's position on Laos, where
                    Kissinger and others thought that they were not as tough as they should be. This
                    related more to the Chinese than to the Soviets, but also included the Soviets.
                    In the end, nothing was given away on Berlin. Indeed, in the end, Khrushchev had
                    to withdraw his free city proposals. Then there were years of disputes about
                    access modalities. That wasn't really settled until the 1971 Quadripartite
                    Agreement on Berlin access.</p>
                <p>I will say that, because we were nose-to-nose and there was a tank confrontation
                    at the sector line, Berlin was seen by many people (including many in the
                    administration at the time) as a potential flash point where either through bad
                    judgment or some incident, things could really go seriously wrong, and
                    spread.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think most of us sort of in the trade looked at Berlin
                        as being the place where - You know, I mean including maybe an uprising in
                        East Germany or something like, you know, the issue </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There were lots of things. There was the refugee issue, the flow of
                    refugees from Communist East Germany, that led to the erection of the Berlin
                    Wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Actually, Dean Rusk, at the time the Wall went up (this is also
                    jumping ahead chronologically) was rather relieved, I think. He practically said
                    so. The steady flow of refugees was stopped, and the potential of incidents, or
                    East Germans or Soviets coming after them into West Berlin and maybe starting
                    something that way, was foreclosed by the Wall. So there was a certain
                    ambivalence among American officials. You know, nowadays it's said that things
                    were simple during the Cold War.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We knew who the enemy was, and we knew what to do. But the issues of
                    how to deal with that enemy, how to treat him, were complex and often very
                    controversial. The Germans and the three occupying powers weren't always in
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, you know, there's been the feeling for a
                        long time that to have a divided Germany and a divided Korea wasn't that bad
                        a thing [laughter]. I mean, they were two powerhouses that were-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right, although in our case, we were steadfastly verbally in
                    favor of German unification, but we also saw certain advantages of the division.
                    Now, our European friends - the British and the French, the Italians, and others
                    - could have lived with a divided Germany forever. That was evident 20 years
                    later, when the U.S. gave the strongest support to re-unification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes [laughter].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There's a Frenchman who said, “I love Germany so much that I prefer
                    two of them.” So there is all of that in the mix as well. But we had a lot at
                    stake in West Berlin. You know, we were identified with it as a place of
                    freedom, not as a free city, but as democratic. Willy Brandt, the Governing
                    Mayor of Berlin, was a great hero at that time. Berlin was an issue of prestige,
                    and psychologically a key place. There were some people who said, “You know,
                    it's very foolish to tie yourself to a place that's an island in geostrategic
                    terms, and in which you can't possibly defend yourself without enlarging a
                    conflict.”</p>

                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But I think the Kennedy people were really rather emotionally tied
                    to Berlin, as demonstrated when the Wall went up, and when Vice President
                    Johnson was there. And, of course, when Kennedy went there (”Ich bin ein
                    Berliner.”)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Wall went up in sixty-three. [editor's note: thWall
                        went up in August, 1961]. Well, let's go to the missile crisis of '62. Were
                        there any harbingers of this, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, as I said earlier, in retrospect, I think there were. We
                    should have asked ourselves more seriously what the Russians were doing, and
                    what Khrushchev would do when the basic notion that they were way ahead of us in
                    the missile field was officially reversed by us [in the Gilpatrick speech], and
                    he was confronted with the issue of what to do about it in order not to lose all
                    his momentum. I think we - I, and others who were working this problem - maybe
                    we should have been more thoughtful about it. But there was a military
                    relationship between the Soviets and the Cubans, which we tracked very
                    carefully. I can't remember when we got the first reports that they were sending
                    some medium-range bombers, IL-28s (Ilyushin), to Cuba, which we didn't think
                    were that much of a problem, but were demonstrative. We had fighters and were
                    able to watch them pretty carefully through reconnaissance and other
                    intelligence techniques. But Cuba was becoming more and more of a Soviet
                    military position, not just ideological and political. Actually, there was a lot
                    of friction between the Soviets and Castro on a whole variety of grounds. [end

                <p>I can't give you the dates of studies that INR, CIA, and the intelligence
                    community wrote. Of course, in INR, Cuba was an issue that fell partly in my
                    office, the Soviet Office, and partly in the Latin American Research Office. The
                    same was true in the State Department policy bureaus. Of course, it came
                    together at the top; but the Soviet relationship with the Cubans was tracked
                    closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Then the Russians started transferring some surface-to-air defense
                    missiles to Cuba. That was a qualitative move, a change of the type of military
                    equipment that had been going there. They flew reconnaissance flights down our
                    East Coast to Cuba, outside our territorial limits, and we watched. Then in the
                    summer of '62, there were beginning reports and rumors and questions about
                    whether they were moving something more than fairly modest numbers of mid-range
                    bombers, but possibly missiles. In that respect, there were questions and
                    disagreements. Some people were convinced. Kennedy's new head of CIA, John
                    McCone, thought so.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>There were people who theorized that the Soviets weren't going to send SA-2s
                    (surface-to-air defense missiles) to Cuba unless they had something very
                    important to protect. They speculated whether there was more military stuff
                    going in there, including missiles. I think we laid on extra U-2 spy planes to
                    keep an eye on it. The first indications?as always, disputes about how to
                    interpret them?began to come in the late summer of 1962, or a little later than
                    that. This has all been written up by innumerable people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was it coming in to you, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We were certainly getting all the intelligence that other people
                    were getting, but, you know, we weren't photo-interpreters. We had to rely on
                    people who interpreted. They thought the pattern of how air defense missiles
                    were deployed resembled what the Soviets did in places where they had offensive
                    missiles. Then, beyond the technicalities of also interpreting what were the
                    scratches on the ground, there was the question of whether the Soviets would
                    ever do such a thing!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There were people who said, “Well, you know, Khrushchev may be a
                    temperamental guy, but he must know that if he does something like that, the
                    U.S. will react very sharply-”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: “And that the Soviets are inherently cautious.” This is what was
                    always said about Stalin, although by now Khrushchev, I think, had pretty much
                    disabused people of that general theory - that the Russians were always cautious
                    and precisely judged the risk factors in what they were doing. I mean, already
                    in the Middle East, their arms relationships with the Egyptians and the Syrians
                    had gotten them close to potential conflicts there. They had been quite
                    aggressive in handling our aircraft operations around their periphery; and in
                    Berlin they had been quite provocative on a very sensitive issue for us; and
                    then the excursion into Cuba, and into the Congo, for that matter, and other
                    things. There was some question whether Khrushchev really was in the Stalin mold
                    of great caution. I'm not even so sure how cautious Stalin should be viewed as
                    having been. So there were debates about whether the Soviets would do such a
                    thing as put offensive missiles into Cuba, and would take the risks and chances
                    right at the doorstep of the U.S. But there were people who were worried how we
                    would react if something like this came to light. A lot of this uncertainty, I
                    guess, transmitted itself to the Soviets. Of course, they had people around here
                    that listened in to everybody.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Starting in 1962, we had a Soviet ambassador here, Dobrynin, who was very
                    skillful in making contacts in the high levels of the administration and among
                    the Washington in-groups of journalists and others. He was, I think, for the
                    Soviets a very productive source, maybe a confusing source, of American thoughts
                    and preferences and ideas that he reported back directly to Khrushchev. I'm sure
                    it was kind of a difficult time all around, for the Soviets to determine what
                    was going on here with Kennedy, and for us in determining what was going on in
                    the Soviet Union. People (by and large, I mean the pros, the old hands) were
                    reluctant to accept the notion that the Soviets would do something like putting
                    missiles in Cuba. But Senator Kenneth Keating of New York made a big speech in
                    the Senate, before we had confirmatory intelligence-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -but apparently based on rumors and Cuban refugees. He persisted in
                    making an issue of it. Then, of course, the intelligence community was
                    confronted with indisputable evidence (i.e., via U-2 and satellite photos) and
                    made the judgments that it did - late, but nevertheless, in time - before these
                    missiles became operational, and before all of them had been shipped into Cuba.
                    Their identification was based on intelligence that showed footprints in Cuba
                    identical to those that they were watching inside the Soviet Union for this type
                    of missile.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, of course. I mean this was the core of Kremlinology - to see
                    what the situation in the leadership was. During Stalin's time, people tracked
                    potential splits and divisions in the Politburo, and so on. After Stalin's
                    death, this became a fine art as well as science because there wasn't this
                    prestigious, tough, old fighter at the top, but the next generation of
                    successors, who came in right at the start in 1953. Malenkov wasn't shot, but he
                    was exiled, basically, and demoted; Khrushchev worked his way to the top; Beria,
                    the chief cop, was executed. There was a lot of turmoil in the leadership before
                    Khrushchev began to sort of stabilize his position.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>But the questions of who's on top and who's against whom were very much a matter
                    of constant concern. We weren't so sure when this problem developed in Cuba, and
                    a lot of study has been done since. Khrushchev's son has since written about it
                    at length; and people have made practically a cottage industry out of re-playing
                    the Cuban missile crisis, including on the Soviet side, and a lot of archival
                    material is now available. In those days we weren't sure, but we suspected that
                    Khrushchev was pretty much on his own in running this missile deployment (he
                    obviously needed some people who actually moved the missiles, physically), but
                    it wasn't clear to us how it really stacked up in the Politburo. Of course,
                    anything that leaked out of the Politburo in the end always showed a substantial
                    majority, if not unanimity. But I think those reports didn't really get in deep
                    enough, because our intelligence was good, but it wasn't so good that you could
                    really penetrate in the depths of it. But by the time of the Cuban missile
                    crisis, Khrushchev appeared to us as something of an adventurer-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -somebody who wanted to be sure that everybody realized that the
                    Soviet Union was a great power, and a global power, as we'd say now. Soviets
                    said, even Foreign Minister Gromyko would say, “There's no problem anywhere in
                    the world which can be settled without the Soviet Union,” and so on. So I think
                    Khrushchev was seen as something of a risk- taker.</p>
                <p>What I think we missed, in my vie(this is hindsight, although I had some feelings
                    about it shortly after the missile crisis was over), was that Khrushchev wasn't
                    moving from strength; that in fact, he was in a contest with the Chinese, which
                    was getting more and more serious; and that his own situation vis-�-vis the U.S.
                    was not as strong as he had believed, or we had believed, or others had
                    believed; and that he was, therefore, looking for ways of demonstrating his
                    power or at least of buying time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: My view at the time was somewhat different from other people's
                    views, which linked the Cuban crisis very closely to breaking the logjam in
                    Berlin. That is, they felt that Khrushchev wanted to threaten us with missiles
                    in order to make clear to us that we couldn't escalate a conflict over Berlin
                    without a risk of serious damage from several directions to our homeland. My
                    feeling at the time was that he was trying to make up for the ground that he
                    lost after bluffing with his strategic missile advances, starting in 1957, and
                    having been discovered as a bluffer. We announced it to him in the Gilpatrick
                    speech, but we announced it in other ways as well. He needed something to tide
                    him over so that he wouldn't have to pour huge, additional resources into what
                    had now become a real race in the offensive area. I thought that was a more
                    weighty reason for his going into Cuba than trying to break the logjam in
                    Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>In fact, I recently gave an extemporaneous talk at Johns Hopkins in which I
                    suggested rather boldly that the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union, not
                    quite 30 years later, was foreshadowed in Khrushchev's getting the Soviet Union
                    into a major and continuing arms race with the United States, which economically
                    bankrupted them-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There are a lot of different aspects to it. But anyway, that was my
                    feeling at the time when the crisis was over. But while it was going on, we
                    didn't have time to speculate at great length about the deeper meanings of it
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing, again from your perspective, an impact on
                        Khrushchev's authority and all after the missile crisis, because here he had
                        put up, and they basically backed down? I mean their qualifications, but I
                        mean basically, he didn't come out of this very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think we assumed that it was going to mean trouble for him
                    politically. There were several incidents, and rumors and reports that there was
                    a group of people organizing against him and getting ready to remove him; and a
                    lot of people were talking and jabbering that they supposedly had such
                    information. I think we got some stuff through our clandestine sources that
                    suggested that.</p>
                <p>As I have said, theorizing about Khrushchev's motives and intentions went on
                    throughout the crisis. But once the offensive missile deployments in Cuba were
                    established without doubt by our intelligence, we went into crisis mode. INR
                    obviously didn't make policdespite the inclinations of its Director, Roger
                    Hilsman, to help out in this respecbut we concentrated our analytical products
                    on the growing information flow and on assessments of probable Soviet responses
                    to the several U.S. actions that were being considered.</p>
                <p>We were also under siege from the press, which in those days had virtually
                    complete access to the State Department building. Alert reporters quickly
                    noticed when lights were burning all night in Soviet Affairs and some Latin
                    American offices, as well as in the executive offices on the seventh floor. We
                    were obviously sternly instructed to keep our mouths shut. The prominent
                    diplomatic correspondents who smelled a rat held their fire when requested, but
                    still tried to gather information for later use.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>We got read-outs from the specially-created “EXCOM” and were aware that President
                    Kennedy would address the nation on Monday evening, October 22, 1962. We
                    gathered that collective speech-drafting was underway. Ironically, Soviet
                    Foreign Minister Gromyko was in the U.S. for the annual UN General Assembly
                    meeting, and he was meeting with both the President and Secretary of State Rusk
                    about the usual agenda. We heard that on Cuba, he assured each of them that all
                    Soviet activities regarding Cuba were defensive. From what trickled down to our
                    level, we wondered, and wrote in a brief analysis, how much and indeed whether
                    Gromyko knew what was going on in Cuba.</p>
                <p>As it happened, my wife and I had an engagement in New York City on the weekend
                    before Kennedy's speech. We saw our friends, and then I did a quick turn-around,
                    leaving my wife in New Yor(where she was waiting to meet her mother who was
                    returning from a trip), just beyond the range of the Soviet missiles in Cuba, as
                    I calculated. I urged her to buy a battery-operated transistor radio (our first)
                    so that she could listen to President Kennedy's speech.</p>
                <p>Once Kennedy had spoken, we analysts in INR looked for Soviet reactions, public
                    and private. As regards the latter, private channels were proliferating beyond
                    the formal governmental ones. We had prompt access to the formal letters going
                    back and forth, but much less so to personal diplomacy, either authorized or
                    volunteered by journalists, academics and businessmen. The official U.S.
                    position, insisting on Soviet withdrawal of offensive missiles already deployed
                    and the turning-around of ships bringing additional ones, was elaborated by
                    Adlai Stevenson, our Ambassador at the UN. As Kennedy's speech had made clear,
                    the U.S. was imposing a “quarantine” around Cuba. This produced lively polemics
                    by the Soviets in New York, Moscow, Washington and in all the other
                    channels.</p>
                <p>Before Stevenson's main address, Hilsman took me along to an Oval Office meeting
                    where the text was being mulled over. I was struck by how much time and effort,
                    from the President on down, was being devoted to precise wording and even to the
                    rhythm of the speech. Whenever someone came up with an especially felicitous
                    phrase, there was praise by the President and then by Mac Bundy, speech-writer
                    Ted Sorenson and court historian Arthur Schlesinger. The latter two eagerly
                    contributed their own preferred formulations. Somewhere in the back row, there
                    was an NSC staffer who cautioned the drafters about accuracy and a legal expert
                    who made sure that no threats were uttered that might contravene international
                    law. Inevitably, as the group dispersed, someone (maybe Kennedy himself) came up
                    with the old saw that this had been “the most distinguished gathering since
                    Thomas Jefferson dined alone.” Stevenson eventually got full TV coverage of his
                    UN presentation, including especially his dramatic clash with Soviet Ambassador
                    Valerian Zorin.</p>
                <p>The days and nightsome nights spent on a cot I had transported from home to my
                    officrushed on. I hunt-and-pecked away at my typewriter as I tried as best I
                    could to figure out and report on the pattern of Soviet behavior, especially
                    when the first encounter between the U.S. Navy and a Soviet missile-carrying
                    vessel would occur.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Along with several signals in the corridors of the UN and elsewhere, we received
                    some indications from the journalist John Scali (who had been in touch with a
                    Soviet KGB officer who masqueraded as their Embassy's press officer) that a deal
                    might be had if we could do something about our missiles in Turkey and give
                    commitments not to invade Cuba again (a la the Bay of Pigs). Scali evidently
                    contacted half the EXCOM on this.</p>
                <p>But as the week following Kennedy's speech drew to a close, my memo(subjected to
                    close scrutiny by Hilsman) began to sense a pattern of Soviet second thoughts.
                    Soviet ships challenged by U.S. destroyers were turning around. I took a night
                    off and sneaked away with my wife to watch the opening of the film, “The Longest
                    Day,” at the Ontario theater.</p>
                <p>After a few nights sleeping on my cot in the office, I went home for the weekend,
                    having written a short memo analyzing Khrushchev's hard-nosed public letter to
                    Kennedy. As I was dropping off to sleep in my bed at home, the phone rang: our
                    Duty Officer was calling to say that there was a private letter from Khrushchev
                    which seemed to unravel the “knot” about which Khrushchev had warned publicly. I
                    rushed back to the office, and was told that Bobby Kennedy had already urged the
                    President to ignore the public letter and to respond to the private one. This,
                    of course, was not our call to make, but as I recall, the memo we wrote
                    concluded that the private letter was indeed the more valid message. The U.S.
                    response became known as the “Trollope Ploy.”</p>
                <p>Much was to follow in the weeks and months to come to formalize the deal that got
                    the Soviet missiles withdrawn from Cuba. We did what we could to feed judgments
                    about Soviet intentions to John McCloy, who headed the post-crisis haggling with
                    Mikoyan, his Soviet counterpart. My colleagues and I could then begin to devote
                    time to reflecting on what had happened, what it meant for the future, and why
                    the pre-crisis National Intelligence Estimate had on balance concluded that
                    Khrushchev wouldn't run the risks which he ended up running.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, one of the follow-ons to the missile crisis was a substantial
                    improvement in Soviet relations with the U.S. Kennedy's American University
                    speech in 1963 led to the Limited Test Ban Treaty being negotiated, along with
                    the U.K. It wasn't really much of an arms control treaty, since underground
                    tests continued. It was an environmental treaty, because it ended atmospheric
                    tests. There was some feeling (and again, in retrospect, in my case a stronger
                    feeling) that perhaps Khrushchev was trying to cool the frictions with the U.S.
                    a bit, after suffering the setback of the missile crisis and basically having to
                    give up on his efforts to create a separate regime in Berlin via the free city
                    proposal. Maybe he wanted to gain some time. Not long afterwards, Kennedy was
                    assassinated, and there was some worry in Moscow because the man who was caught
                    had lived in Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oswald, yes, and -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Oswald. So they fell all over themselves to assure us that they had
                    nothing to do with the assassination. Of course, there still remains a matter of
                    speculation just what motivated Oswald, and who was behind him, and so on.</p>
                <p>I think Khrushchev never really recovered from the missile crisis. I believe it's
                    not just the fact that he lost face, and that the U.S. denied him a close-in
                    missile threat against our homeland. We still went through our own Vietnam-era
                    trials and tribulations, so it's not definitive in terms of a permanent American
                    ascendancy in that sense, but he had again gambled and lost. I think that
                    clearly was something that other figures in the Soviet Union saw. Of course,
                    after some earlier attempts, when they got rid of him in 1964 (kicking him out
                    of the top position), they used words suggesting adventurism, and so on, as part
                    of the indictment of Khrushchev and the reason for his replacement by Brezhnev
                    and others.</p>
                <p>Now, how closely we tracked it and were able to predict it in terms of timing, I
                    think that was at best only a fair amount. All I can tell you is my personal
                    situation: I asked for a sabbatical from INR, because I wanted to spend a year
                    at Columbia and write something about Khrushchev, while I was also working here
                    in Washington, at SAIS. My sabbatical was approved, and it started with the
                    academic year of 1964-65.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Two weeks after I started, Khrushchev was out!</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was asked to come back to State at least for a few weeks, because
                    one couldn't tell what was going to happen, and they wanted the full staff in
                    place.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So, you know, I'm not going to claim that I foresaw the collapse of
                    the Khrushchev regime!</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think there was general agreement in the NIEs (National
                    Intelligence Estimates) of the period; and other work that was produced, I
                    think, indicates (although I haven't gone back to review it) that there were a
                    lot of indications that Khrushchev's career was declining.</p>

                        be unfair of saying; but I take it you weren't a Kremlinologist as </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I wasn't trained as one. I learned the art, and how to decipher the
                    signals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You learned the art; but I was wondering whether there was
                        sort of a priesthood of Kremlinologists within the government, including the
                        CIA, the [Soviet] Desk and all, and whether this was sort of a difficult
                        group to get around because they held the sacred books, and they </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, they did. I mean, there was one thing about Kremlinology: you
                    had to remember everything! You had to even remember where a comma was in a
                    sentence, because if it was removed, it might change the meaning. You had to
                    have all that stuff in your head, and some people (this is before the computer
                    age) had huge collections of index cards with statements on everything that one
                    could cross-check. But content analysis isn't the only part of Kremlinology. It
                    also involved the history, and the early connections of these leaders with other
                    leaders in their earlier days out in the boondocks. Some of the disputes were
                    carried on in allusions to Communist theological clashes 50 or more years
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But the Kremlinologists did not always agree with each other in
                    their interpretations, and there were disputes between the research analysts and
                    those people who were concerned with actually dealing the Soviets, which we
                    weren't. I mean, we knew a few Soviets; and occasionally, one of our people
                    would be assigned to the embassy in Moscow, or, as I had been, would be part of
                    a U.S. delegation that negotiated something or other with the Soviets. But those
                    whom we met were mostly diplomats, with scripts that had to be closely
                    sifted.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>There was one conference in 1958 where we dealt with some people who weren't
                    diplomats, but scientists. But the officials who dealt with the Soviets
                    day-to-day didn't always agree with what the Talmudic scholars of Soviet
                    literature and statements were reading. There was actually a certain friction,
                    in that the people who heard things from the mouths of Soviets personally
                    thought they had a better feel for what the Soviets were up to than the people
                    who buried their noses in the thousands of pages of statements and broadcasts
                    and journals. On the other hand, those latter people thought, “Well, these guys
                    talk to diplomats. What do they know?” or, “Those Russian diplomats are just
                    misleading our people.” So there was a certain amount of friction between the
                    people actively involved in dealings with the Russians, and those who were
                    buried in the books, in the Kremlinological science and art. I think those
                    factions probably were more evident in the academic world, where people
                    developed theories and had kind of a stake in their theories of Soviet behavior
                    or the behavior of individual Soviet leaders.</p>
                <p>I told my staff analysts in RSB, (INR's Office of Research and Analysis for the
                    Soviet Bloc), “Do not become predictable! Don't develop a stake in a particular
                    theory, or people will ignore what you send them because they'll figure they
                    know what you're going to say anyway! Call the shots as you see them. Of course,
                    there are some basic underlying theories that we need to work with, but don't
                    make yourself predictable!” I felt that was not our business. Our business was
                    to acknowledge that we may have been wrong somewhere, or to change our minds
                    when warranted. “It might be confusing to the policy guys, but call the shots as
                    you see them; and if something doesn't fit, acknowledge it!” That was my
                    philosophy, but you know, I had nothing at stake in terms of being personally
                    associated with a particular theory of Soviet behavior.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No! I never did! It lasted about two or three weeks. I'd gone up to
                    Columbia for the seminar that I had agreed to do, and I had started making an
                    outline about what I was going to write about Khrushchev; and I was teaching a
                    research course here at Johns Hopkins, being sort of a helpmate to people who
                    were working on their Ph.D.s. Then Khrushchev was kicked out on October 14 or
                    15. On the same day, the Chinese tested their first atomic bomb.</p>

                    the time, it was as Deputy Director of the Office there. The idea was that maybe
                    in three or four weeks we'd get some idea of how things were going to develop
                    and whether I could be dispensed with for awhile, but I never made it back to my
                    sabbatical.</p>

                <p>Today is April 30, 2001. Hal, Khrushchev fell October 15, 1964.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, you were brought back as Deputy Director of?
                        was it INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: A part of INmy office was the Office of Research for the Soviet
                    Union and Eastern Europe. R-S-B. I think I was Deputy Director at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I can't remember exactly when I became Director, but it was soon
                    after my aborted sabbatical, in the mid-'60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the sort of the initial reading when Khrushchev

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, as I recall it, there had been all sorts of mumblings and
                    rumblings out of Moscow. The rumor machine and occasionally, I guess, the
                    intelligence people picked up some more juicy indications of some sort of
                    conspiracy against Khrushchev. I think with hindsight, a lot of this has been
                    reconstructed, and it didn't really look as that much of a surprise, because
                    it'd been brewing for a variety of reasons, and he was accused-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, and then when it did happen, they accused him of harebrained
                    schemes. You couldn't tell exactly which ones they were talking about, whether
                    it was the Cuban missile crisis or the domestic courses-</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Whatever the issues were. So there clearly was developing a majority
                    of people in the Politburo and in places where such decisions are made, and a
                    consensus that he should leave. One of the interesting changes, of course, was
                    that they didn't throw him in jail; they didn't shoot him. They let him
                    retire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He was seen later from time to time. He was also able to smuggle out
                    or permit the smuggling out of his memoirs, which eventually were published in
                    this country and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>So his ouster wasn't a total surprise, but obviously whenever these things
                    happen, you wonder what's going to happen next. Brezhnev became his successor,
                    but they really didn't name a single leader. They weren't willing or prepared,
                    or maybe there were compromise decisions not to have a single individual, so
                    that they had this troika of Brezhnev as First Secretary, General Secretary of
                    the Communist Party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And Podgorny as President of the Soviet Union, and Kosygin as Prime
                    Minister. Just exactly how the power was shared among them is hard to say. I
                    frankly haven't looked back at the period, so I can't recollect too precisely
                    what our analyses were, except that we were facing a cast of characters that
                    wasn't new. And that also included the top military people, and, in the Party,
                    the Secretariat. And then the KGB.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We'd known a good deal about them, and they'd been seen by Western
                    people, including Americans. But it was a change, and the general assumption was
                    that some of the more adventurous and, if you want, erratic behavior of
                    Khrushchev's was going to become more apparatchik-like, and maybe more
                    predictable.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, in a way I would think it would be, say,
                        somewhat of a relief because when you have one person calling the shots, and
                        particularly one person who does seem erratic, this can be scary! When
                        you've got three apparatchiks doing it, they're not going to stick their
                        necks out too faat least for a while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. I think when you have several people, you have to assume that
                    one or the other can't easily pull off things that carry a great deal of risk.
                    On the other hand, there also is maneuvering among them, or you have to assume
                    there's maneuvering among them; and they also have their followers scattered
                    through the system-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So one or the other of them, or maybe two of them, may want to
                    manufacture or bring about some kind of a foreign crisis</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -or lean more heavily on the notion that the U.S. was out to get
                    them, and the “imperialists” were always mobilizing for this, that, and the
                    other. There was a dynamic arms competition going on. I don't think one can
                    assume that a more collective setup necessarily is a guarantee against risky
                    behavior. We did have some fairly difficult times - I wouldn't exactly say close
                    calls, but still we had some interesting moments in the era after
                    Khrushchev.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, yes. Well of course one of things being, as we're seeing today with our
                    relations with China, that when other things fail, the nationalist card. You
                    know, [to say] “we've got an enemy who's doing nasty things to us”, as the
                    Chinese seem to be doing, you know, is a good solid way of gaining popular
                    support.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. I think in China, as I think in the Soviet Union by the
                    mid-to-late '60s, there wasn't much left of communism as a mobilizing idea, but
                    there was still some. In China, there's very little of it now. I think something
                    like national pride, reminding people of the terrible humiliations that they say
                    they suffered for a long time, is a mobilizing force.</p>
                <p>But the Chinese leadership is also uneasy about excessive nationalism because
                    they're afraid that they can't control it, and it might even turn against them.
                    We saw this at the demonstrations against the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, after the
                    accidental American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade (in the 1990s
                    Balkan War); the regime got a little itchy.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>In the case of Russia, in terms of ideology or values that people are eagerly
                    attached to and that have a mobilizing effect, I think by this time, they were
                    getting more and more moribund. I guess they still thought of themselves as a
                    leader of some global movement, and still thought of themselves as being a kind
                    of model for the Third World. They had various sorts of programs with the
                    Africans and others to help them get into the industrial age. Of course, the
                    Soviets, the Russians in particular, also had a strong racist streak; so there
                    were problems in their relations with a lot of these people, including the
                    blacks from Africa studying at Lumumba University in Moscow, for example, who
                    complained, and then-</p>
                <p>Q: Well, just about this time, I was a chief of the consular section in Belgrade.
                    I remember there was a mass exodus of African students from Bulgaria, who had
                    been going to Sofia University and all, suffering some of the same thing, except
                    they could get out! They came out and said, “The heck with you! We're tired of
                    being called black monkeys by the Bulgarians.” So I mean there's some-</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. There's that in the Russian/Soviet case. There was always the
                    issue of the Russian women being attracted to some of the blacks, and this
                    produced anger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So I think that - again in retrospect, 25 years before the collapse,
                    which no one really predicted - we still saw ourselves in the long twilight
                    struggle that Kennedy had talked about. We didn't think, any of us, at that
                    time, that we would witness the dissolution of the Soviet Union that happened in
                    1989, '90, '91. Certainly with hindsight, I think some of the signs of this
                    society losing its momentum and its sense of mission, some of that was
                    present.</p>
                <p>The three leaders who took over after Khrushchev were not particularly inspiring
                    people. I think Kosygin was probably the most effective of them, as a bureaucrat
                    and in the economy. They obviously had political skills in their terms, or they
                    wouldn't have landed where they did. But matters weren't all that clear at the
                    time. We still saw them building missiles, and we still saw them active in their
                    arms programs with Syria, Egypt and Iraq, and so on. In fact, we were just a
                    couple of years away from a serious Middle East Crisis in 1967-</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Six-Day War, when there was a time when it was far from clear
                    what the Soviets would do. So there were still some rough times to come.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and also, later, the increasing expansion in Africa, which are -</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, that too had already begun. They'd been cautious about it
                    initially, but they did see some parts as fruitful for asserting themselves and
                    playing leadership roles; and they did bring a lot of African students to the
                    USSR. A lot of the post-colonial regimes, especially in francophone Africa, were
                    left-leaning, including toward Communism. Many of those people had been educated
                    in Paris and metropolitan France. So the Soviets saw that as an opportunity.</p>
                <p>I think also by that time, this became a source of competition with the Chinese,
                    who were picturing themselves as the leaders of what we came to call the Third
                    Worland as an example of a down-trodden society which was finding itself, and
                    becoming gradually an economic and social model. We hadn't had Deng Xiaoping
                    yet. And they still went through a lot of their own trials and tribulations. I
                    think a lot of what we used to call “the Sino-Soviet offensive” in the Third
                    World, in fact became more and more matters of rivalry and competition between
                    the two of them, as to who was leading the world communist movement and who was
                    leading the revolt against the imperialists. So here again, I think with
                    hindsight, the Soviets got themselves activated in areas that really presented
                    no great gain for them, either strategically or otherwise, and I think this
                    contributed eventually to their over-extension and downfall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have within the ranks of your unit or Bureau those
                        who thought that there was a division between the Chinese and the Soviets
                        or/and those who felt that they were really close together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, but by the mid-'60s, I think it was widely sensed that there
                    was something not right in the Sino-Soviet relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It hadn't reached its worst manifestations of hostility. I may have
                    mentioned earlier in these conversations that the CIA had had a major study on
                    this subject. It was sanitized and published by Donald Zagoria, who has by now
                    long been out of the government, but at that time he worked at CIA. He pulled
                    together a lot of the material on Sino-Soviet conflict as early as the late
                    '50s, 1957, 1958. We all read this assessment, and we all saw the sources it was
                    based on. There clearly were some rough arguments between the Soviets and the
                    Chinese. I think someone like Mao didn't really consider Khrushchev a great
                    leader. They had arguments over nuclear weapons: the Soviets had helped them
                    station some on Chinese territory, but they argued over the Chinese nuclear
                    program, and on a great variety of things. I think by the mid-'60s, there were
                    still debates in the West about whether Marxist-Leninists could really have a
                    falling-out - although, God knows, anybody that knows something of the history
                    of Communism knows what controversies there were in these parties.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was becoming more apparent, but not as apparent as it was toward
                    the end of the '60s and, of course, during the '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about?we must have been looking rather closely at
                        what the Soviet Union, particularly this new team on board, their attitude
                        towards the war in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. When Kennedy first became president, he made people read a
                    speech that Khrushchev gave at an international Communist conference in November
                    of 1960 on the national liberation wars and so on. Vietnam was seen to be an
                    example and evidence of the Soviets pursuing this kind of warfare against the
                    West, against the U.S. At that time the Chinese seemed to be generally on board
                    with them, also.</p>
                <p>But we did begin to get snippets of material indicating that there were
                    differences or suspicions between them in regard to Vietnam. The Chinese seemed
                    uneasy about how much the Soviets were in evidence in Vietnam; and disputes
                    emerged over time about the Soviet arms shipments through Chinese territory, for
                    which the Chinese wanted to charge various kinds of toll payments. And I think
                    they also wanted to inspect some of the material to see if they could learn
                    something for their own military. Here in Washington, however, I think Vietnam
                    came to be seen as very much Soviet-supported, and also Chinese-supported. But
                    then came indications of some differences.</p>
                <p>There was a strong strain of opinion in the Johnson administration that we should
                    be talking to the Soviets more than we were about Vietnam, because it was
                    thought that the Soviets might not really want to get themselves as deeply
                    involved as they were becoming, and might have been concerned about the U.S.
                    broadening the war a great deal more. In general, Averil Harriman, in his senior
                    role dealing with Vietnam, was to some extent associated with the view that the
                    Soviets might, for one reason or another, be willing to help us end this war.
                    That notion persisted for some years, and there were probes of Soviet
                    intentions.</p>
                <p>When I went to the White House in 1969, in the Nixon administration National
                    Security Council (NSC) staff, we started some conversations in 1970, '71, '72,
                    with the Soviets who dealt with Vietnam. The Soviets were very polemical.
                    Nevertheless, I think they had begun to lean toward the conclusion, more or
                    less, that the war was not doing them any good, and that it interfered with
                    other relationships that they wanted with us, especially the investments they
                    were eager to attract for Siberia. Then I think it also got caught up in the
                    increasingly acute and intense Sino-Soviet dispute.</p>

                        Six-Day War. This is when it looked like things - it's one of those things
                        that's sort of forgotten. We talk about the missile crisis of '62; but
                        actually '67, it looked like both the Soviet Union and the United States
                        were beginning to gear up for doing something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, we were backing opposite parties.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Soviet arms shipments to Egypt and Syria?it's a complicated
                    story, and I assume you're getting oral histories from people who were much more
                    directly involved than I was. In INR, I was watching the Soviet side. The
                    Egyptian blockade of Israel, in the south, seemed to have some Soviet
                    support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Straits of Aqaba [Tiran] and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right?and the kind of intelligence the Israelis were getting stirred
                    up their concern as to whether they could really count on American support. This
                    led them to, in effect, preempt, what we'd call preempt, against the Egyptians
                    in particular. The Israelis attacked first, on the assumption that if they
                    didn't, they were going to be attacked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: They wreaked a lot of havoc on the Egyptian air force, which was
                    partly Soviet-supplied. The interesting thing was that the Soviets were nowhere
                    to be found. They sort of backed away, didn't want to get caught in the middle.
                    I mean they verbally supported their Arab friends, and were very critical and
                    made threatening noises toward Israel, but they didn't really want to get
                    directly involved. But we thought we saw at some point, several days into the
                    war, that once the Israelis had also attacked Syria, which had come in on the
                    side of Egypt, the Soviets got edgy. [end of tape]</p>
                <p>The fighting spread to Syria, as the Syrians came in on the side of the
                    Egyptians. We thought we saw some signs that the Soviets were getting disturbed
                    themselves, as the Israelis advanced into Syria; I felt maybe the time was
                    coming for efforts to get this thing to shut down, but I was not directly
                    involvecertainly not on the policy side.</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: I recall the uncertainty, but I have never really been able to
                    discover how valid the signs of Soviet concerns were, in terms of actual
                    intelligence that we had. As a matter of clear signs, we couldn't tell about the
                    Soviets. I, personally, didn't think the Soviets wanted to get involved in the
                    war, which might then bring the U.S. in.</p>
                <p>This situation produced these negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviets,
                    which eventually resulted in Resolution 242 (UN Security Council Resolution
                    242), which is still one of the bases of Israeli-Arab relations. It eventually
                    ended the war, and also led to a meeting between Johnson and Kosygin, who was
                    considered their head of the governmennot of the state, but a counterpart to the
                    President of the United States. They had this meeting at-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Glassboro.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Glassboro, in New Jersey, which helped produce the stand-down in the
                    Arab-Israeli War, the Six-Day War, and also involved the first really extended
                    high-level discussion between the U.S. and Soviets on strategic weapons. I
                    didn't participate in that meeting. While they were up there, I was in
                    Washington, trying to keep track of what was going on and what the Soviets were
                    saying at home, and so on. Glassboro was sort of a precursor, with still many,
                    many disagreements, fundamental ones, for what, by 1968, a year later, were
                    supposed to be the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks, or “SALT” talks, as they
                    were called. Then those talks were postponed because of the Soviet invasion of
                    Czechoslovakia in August of 1968.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, '68.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In '67, Defense Secretary McNamara went to Glassboro, but I can't
                    remember now whom Kosygin had with him. But it's interesting enough, in light of
                    what happened later, that McNamara tried to persuade the Soviets to forego their
                    anti-missile programs. They were devoting quite a bit of resources to them.</p>
                <p>Kosygin became quite indignant, saying that “the Soviet Union cannot be deprived
                    of its defenses. The Soviet people would never understand how their defenses
                    could be traded away. Historically, the Russians defended themselves and
                    defeated their enemies, as they did Napoleon, and Hitler, and they could never
                    give up their defenses; it's against their constitution,” and so on. So he was
                    adamant about their not foregoing their missile defense program. It added to
                    pressures here on the Johnson administration, to also get into the business of
                    missile defense.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Not too long after Glassboro, the Johnson administration did, in fact, announce a
                    major U.S. national missile defense program stretched over many years, so that
                    both sides were starting to work on this. There are, of course, all the theories
                    about deterrence that got involved in this issue: that is, the theory that if
                    someone builds a more or less impregnable defense, that he will feel that he can
                    launch a first strike against the other side and then absorb the retaliatory
                    strike because he had missile defenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's why this defense came to be called “destabilizing.” Nowadays
                    (2000, 2001, 2002), there are constantly echoes of that debate in current
                    controversies. So the Glassboro meeting was a major event. And the Six-Day War
                    was also, because for both sides, there were elements of danger which both we
                    and the Soviets sought to avoid.</p>
                <p>Q: What did you feel about during this quite critical time because there had been
                    a word that the Soviets were moving up to a DEFCON (Defense Condition), the
                    equivalent to a?they were alerting their airborne units and all? How good did
                    you feel that our intelligence was that you were getting back?</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I couldn't judge it, how good it was. You know, we got what we
                    got!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was, in that sense, not a great intelligence expert. I was an
                    analyst, an estimator. We had people more adept at and more experienced than I
                    with the military matters and the technical intelligence relating to them. As I
                    said, there were signs that I didn't know the details of, even though I was head
                    of the Soviet INR office, but this all gets into compartmented intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There were signs that the Soviets were getting restless, that I
                    referred to, and which led to the Glassboro summit.</p>

                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: You know, I think the military has to take everything seriously,
                    even if it's still not entirely confirmed. But anything that looked like it
                    might foreshadow some sort of intervention, or possibly be something to lead us
                    to stop the Israelis, we had to take seriously, in the sense that this could
                    escalate into a full-fledged war. That, of course, was the theory in those days:
                    that, with the Soviets, you have to avoid fighting at any level, lest it
                    escalate.</p>
                <p>Q: Escalate, yes.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I didn't have the sense in that situation, as I recall it now, that
                    we were on the threshold of war with the Soviets. I thought more that there was
                    maneuvering. They were maneuvering; we were maneuvering; we were helping the
                    Israelis replenish their forces. We weren't really directly involved. We also
                    lost one of our intelligence ships in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Israel </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Liberty,</hi>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right. So that raised some mixed feelings in the U.S., and it
                    still rattles around nowadays, as more and more documentation and data is
                    declassified.</p>
                <p>But I think the Johnson administration wanted to get this war stopped. My sense
                    of it was that the Soviets certainly didn't want to end up losing face or losing
                    their special relationship with the Arabs, which had become quite a major thing
                    in the Khrushchev period. But they also didn't want this affair to run out of
                    control. Somebody in Moscow must have said, “Look! These are all Ilyushins. It's
                    our weapons, and they've been defeated by the Israelis, supported by the
                    American imperialists.” I think this must have weighed on them. Maybe some
                    people in Moscow (I don't know that there's evidence) would have said, “Well
                    now, our prestige is at stake, and we've got to escalate,” or others would say,
                    “Wait a minute. This really may run out of control. We'd better find a way to
                    end it.'"</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Of course, UN Resolution 242, which came out of this situation, was interpreted
                    by the Soviet Union as requiring the Israelis to give up all the occupied
                    territories. This is rather different from the way the Israelis or we interpret
                    the language of 242: that is, the resolution states that Israel must withdraw
                    “from territories occupied” in the 1967 war, to “secure and recognized
                    boundaries.” The drafters of the resolution deliberately did not call for
                    withdrawal from “the territories occupied” in the war (as the Arab states had
                    demanded), or from “all the territories occupied,” as the Soviet Union had
                    insisted. The Israelis could read the careful language, and they weren't about
                    to relinquish all the occupied territories and return to pre-war lines. That
                    issue is still kicking around, and unresolved.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We noticed?couldn't avoid it?some of the rumblings in Eastern
                    Europe, and certainly in Czechoslovakia with the “Prague Spring.” I think few of
                    us had any doubt that sooner or later the Soviets would move in to squelch
                    it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But it was going on, and it seemed, too, that there were some
                    disputes (as indeed, it turns out there were) among the Soviet leadership about
                    just how to handle it. There may have been some underground dissidents in the
                    Soviet setup who sympathized with what was happening in Czechoslovakia. We saw a
                    lot of Soviet military moves, mobilization; and of course, they had troops in
                    Czechoslovakia itself. There had been the Hungarian case (the 1956 Soviet
                    invasion of Hungary) and the East German case (putting down uprisings in 1953).
                    But we also, I think, tended to think that they would try to get the
                    Czechoslovaks to back off, in order to avoid another Budapest-type, Hungary-type
                    invasion. The Soviets also sent word to their Warsaw Pact satellites to prepare
                    for action-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -because they were concerned about the reactions of the
                    international Communist movement, particularly the large Communist parties in
                    France and Italy and smaller ones in Western Europe, whom they considered as
                    assets. So I think there were some questions in Moscow: how far to permit this
                    to go, and how and when to stop it if it couldn't be stopped by simply
                    manipulating the politics of it in Prague and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>But the acuteness of the issue was sort of up and down through the summer of
                    1968. I remember I had been asked by Deputy Secretary Nick Katzenbach to join
                    him in a small delegation going to India, because we wanted to establish some
                    regular consultations with the Indians. He wanted me to go along as a Soviet
                    expert to explain to the Indians our perceptions of what the Soviets were up to,
                    particularly in the Indian area, the Indian Ocean, and in other respects. That
                    trip kept being delayed. We had several dates in July and August when we were
                    going to go to New Delhi. The trip kept being postponed because we couldn't tell
                    what was happening in Czechoslovakia. It dragged into August. I guess Dean Rusk,
                    the Secretary of State, said, “Well, people have got to take vacations. So if
                    you have vacation plans, go on vacation; and if something should happen, we can
                    all get together.”</p>
                <p>Indeed, I went to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with my family. I was playing poker
                    with some neighbors and other friends on the night of August 21, 1968, when I
                    got a phone call from the Department. They said, “it looks like it's starting,
                    and Secretary Rusk wants to see everybody in the morning.” This was unusual,
                    because we weren't ordinarily included in those meetings. I think maybe Tom
                    Hughes was the Director of INR at the time. He called and said, “You'd better
                    get back,” which I did. We did, indeed, have this meeting with Secretary Rusk on
                    the morning of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, which was already the end
                    of the day in Europe.</p>
                <p>It's kind of an interesting story, I think. On the one hand, people felt down
                    because this appeared to be the end of a somewhat promising development inside
                    the Iron Curtain. But Rusk said, “Look, I don't want any one of you to go around
                    with your heads hanging in grief or shame. This is none of our business. This is
                    their business! It is a demonstration of the utter weakness and failure of the
                    Communist system, but they're the ones who have to deal with this! We are not
                    going to get involved in this. We're not going to encourage the opponents by
                    mobilizing forces.”</p>
                <p>The German government at the time, a coalition government headed by Chancellor
                    Kiesinger, was extremely concerned that nothing be done on German soil that
                    would appear to be provocative vis-�-vis the Soviets. Kiesinger didn't even want
                    the intelligence alert to be heightened in Germany, a neighboring country,
                    because he was worried the Soviets would pick it up and misinterpret it and
                    maybe lash out. So Rusk didn't write off the Soviet crackdown, but he didn't see
                    anything that we could do except issue the protest statements, which we did
                    jointly with the Allies. But he didn't want to widen it and turn it into an
                    East-West conflict or a NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, right.</p>
                <p>Q: -Where accusations had been made that we encouraged it and then did nothing. I
                    mean-</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Maybe on the first or second day after the invasion, there were some
                    Soviet claims that they had discovered weapons planted by the NATO imperialists
                    in various places in Czechoslovakia. They started to make this sound as though
                    this conflict wasn't an internal (i.e., domestic) matter in Czechoslovakia at
                    all, that the population were still loyal Communists, but that trouble was
                    stirred up by the West. But they didn't really push it very hard. The U.S.
                    government's reaction was severely criticized here later, in the media and
                    elsewhere, and especially among the various groups that were associated with the
                    “captive nations” campaigns (non-government organizations opposed to Soviet
                    domination or control of Eastern European countries).</p>
                <p>But we also had Vietnam on our hands. Rusk and, I guess, President Johnson and
                    maybe Walt Rostow (who was National Security Advisor at that time) didn't really
                    want to expand this conflict. In fact, I think Rusk said, “You know, in the
                    longer run, this is going to hurt the Soviets much more than maybe even the
                    Czechs who suffered, because it will create big problems in the Western
                    Communist parties, and will show the bankruptcy of communism as a system.” Well,
                    there was a certain logic to that. But there was still a sense, somehow, that at
                    the very least, we ought to take some countermeasures - not military - which we
                    actually did: sanctions and various forms of ostracizing the Soviets.</p>
                <p>It was now August-September of 1968, just two months before the U.S. presidential
                    election. Johnson had already said he was not going to run again. There had been
                    an announcement that meetings would start between us and the Soviets on August
                    22, on the strategic arms limitations. I think Johnson (like presidents coming
                    to the end of their terms) was legacy-conscious, and I think he had expectations
                    that those talks might make some progress. But obviously, those meetings
                    couldn't take place; and they were all canceled. It was to have been a
                    summit-level meeting, to get the SALT talks underway. So the White House had a
                    certain ambivalence about it; but obviously, in the circumstances, they couldn't
                    do anything. The White House also decided not to submit the recently-signed
                    Non-Proliferation Treaty to the Senate for approval.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>We watched very carefully to see whether there were any signs of the Soviets
                    taking special measures around the Czechoslovak borders with the West: Austria,
                    Germany. Then, of course, most of the Czechoslovaks' political leadership were
                    transported off to Moscow. The Russians installed a puppet regime in Prague, and
                    the crisis sort of simmered down. The Russians kept their troops in place. It
                    gradually became part of the landscape, the Czechoslovakia that had tried and
                    failed to free itself.</p>

                        I mean there were other things, but the bloom was certainly off the rose at
                        that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think the bloom was off the rose. I think the French Communist
                    party was conflicted. They had a long tradition of backing the Soviets. So they
                    were still there, and they were still quite a major party and very much a factor
                    in French elections, not so much because they were pro-Soviet, but because they
                    were a big protest movement. They appealed to socialist sentiments in France and
                    in Italy. But I think the ability of the Soviets to command their behavior and
                    their conduct and their support, in relations with us, for example, was damaged
                    quite severely, at least for the time being. By and large, I think our
                    counter-measures (I mean ostracizing the new puppet regime in Czechoslovakia,
                    and punishing the Soviets in various ways - economically, by cutting cultural
                    exchanges, and so on) - I don't know that they had a great deal of effect on the
                    Soviets, if any. But the Soviets, of course, wanted all this to be forgotten
                    very quickly, and were very eager to get started on the arms control talks that
                    had been postponed.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>In the 1968 presidential election, I would guess the Soviets probably preferred
                    Humphrey to Nixon; but in any event, they got Nixon. They had their very able
                    ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin, here in Washington. He had come just before the
                    Cuban missile crisis, and had developed all sorts of contacts in our political
                    system. Our Federal agencies were watching that to some extent, but this was
                    really more for the policy people and the FBI. But during the transition from
                    Johnson to Nixon, the Soviets (through Dobrynin and maybe one or two other
                    people) picked up some threads of contact with the incoming people, including
                    Kissinger. I don't know that they talked directly to Nixon, although Nixon was
                    well known in the Soviet Union. He'd been there in '59, and was Eisenhower's
                    Vice President, but considered anti-Communist. (Actually, I think Kissinger
                    deals with this in his memoirs). The Soviets, through Dobrynin, suggested that
                    it would be helpful in the development of American-Soviet relations if Nixon
                    could include in his inaugural address some language indicating that he was
                    interested in talking with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Now, Nixon had already said (in the Republican Party nominating
                    convention in Miami, in the summer of '68), that he wanted to see us move from
                    an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation. He was suggesting maybe the
                    Cold War ought to be attenuated a bit. Also, President Johnson, during the
                    transition, apparently wanted to re-start or to start the arms control talks
                    that had been postponed or canceled in August, at the time of the invasion of
                    Czechoslovakia. Johnson's people approached the Nixon people to get support for
                    doing this. Nixon did what George W. Bush did on North Korea in 2000, and what
                    other presidents have done in the past: he basically took the position that this
                    was still Johnson's presidency, and he could not get involved in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: What the Nixon people were doing, what Kissinger was doing (and that
                    started during the transition, when I was being transferred to the NSC staff ;
                    Larry Eagleburger was involved; others were involved) - they were trying to sort
                    out their priorities, obviously including policy toward the Soviet Union. They
                    didn't really want to get precipitated into a negotiation that had been
                    scheduled and prepared earlier, and they wanted to review all the issues first.
                    Obviously, Vietnam was the prime concern, and Nixon had said during the '68
                    campaign that he had a secret plan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Today is May 29, 2001. Hain 1969, the Nixon
                        administration is coming in. How did you sort of get connected with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, in two ways. The State Department made up a list of people
                    that it was prepared to assign to the National Security Council (NSC) staff.
                    Kissinger had been named National Security Advisor, and I don't know whether he
                    had asked them for a list, or whether this was just a routine thing that they
                    did in those days, and maybe still do; and I was on that list.</p>
                <p>But apart from that, I had known Kissinger since a few months after the end of
                    the Second World War, because we were both in the Counter Intelligence Corps
                    (CIC) in Germany at that time and we had a mutual friend, a man named Fritz
                    Kraemer, of German birth, who had been in the same division with Kissinger.
                    Kissinger had known Kraemer longer than I had, and Kissinger was sort of his
                    prot�g�. I was sent by the CIC to take a quick course at Oberammergau, which the
                    U.S. Army had taken over at the end of the war. It was a quick course in
                    investigative techniques, and included something about the German and the Nazi
                    organizations, the people who were still subject to automatic arrest, and
                    various things associated with the CIC. That's where I met both Kraemer and
                    Kissinger, in early 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kissinger was already out in the countryside in charge of a town or
                    a county in the German state of Hessen. I was likewise given responsibility for
                    a county in another part of Hessen, and that's how we became acquainted.</p>
                <p>We stayed in touch over the years through Fritz Kraemer, who eventually came to
                    Washington. After his Army service, Henry went to Harvard. I came back to the
                    U.S., and after a brief stint of service in the State Department in 1946-47
                    (scanning captured documents and sorting mail), I went to Johns Hopkins. We kept
                    in touch, and through the years, we met from time to time. When I became a
                    member of the State Department full-time in 1952, Kissinger was writing on
                    various subjects, including his famous book on Nuclear Weapons and Foreign
                    Policy; and he asked me to look at some of his chapters.</p>
                <p>So we had a professional relationship as well as a personal relationship. My wife
                    and I met occasionally with him and his wife. When he was invited by Nixon to
                    take the job of National Security Advisor, he asked me whether I would be
                    willing to come and work for him. That was the second way in which I got
                    involved in the NSC.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>I actually wanted to think about that idea, because I was then chief of the
                    Office of Research and Analysis for the Soviet Bloc, in INR, and had some
                    prospects of further promotion in the State Department. I discussed it with some
                    of my colleagues in the State Department, who weren't so sure that going over to
                    the NSC was all that great, and suggested that maybe I should not do it.</p>
                <p>But anyway, Kissinger was a friend, and he asked me to do it; and Larry
                    Eagleburger had become, more or less, his Executive Assistant, and he urged me
                    to do it as well. Sometime in December of 1968, that is, during the transition,
                    I had a long talk with Henry at the Hotel Pierre, where Nixon's transition team
                    was quartered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is up in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, in New York, at the Pierre. Henry said that he would want me to
                    work on the Soviet Union in the NSC staff, and also on Europe. The two
                    activities had been combined in the Bundy and Rostow NSC staffs, in the Kennedy
                    and Johnson administrations. Kissinger was inclined to maintain that
                    combination, with maybe one senior person (the position he was offering me) and
                    a couple of assistants. That sounded challenging to me. It really was going to
                    put me into the policy sphere, where I had dabbled as new Research officer, but
                    we analysts weren't supposed to really get into policy too much. That prospect
                    sort of sealed it.</p>
                <p>Starting I guess in about mid-December of 1968, I went up to New York
                    periodically for conversations with Kissinger about Soviet policy and NATO
                    policy. The transition group was mostly spending time on Vietnam, inevitably,
                    and on reorganization of the NSC system to make the NSC staff, itself, and the
                    Advisor (at that time still called Special Assistant to the President for
                    National Security Affairs) stronger in making and implementing policy. Nixon had
                    indicated that he wanted to have a strong White House foreign policy operation,
                    even though he had selected William P. Rogers, whom he had known from the
                    Eisenhower administration, as his Secretary of State. So there was a lot going
                    on at the Pierre on an array of issues.</p>
                <p>Kissinger asked me to write an informal paper on what I thought ought to be done
                    in relations with the Soviet Union. I did that, and then came the holidays, and
                    I went on vacation with my family. Then gradually, we got ready to take office
                    after Nixon's inauguration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in your paper what were you suggesting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, actually, he and I had talked about this a bit. The Johnson
                    administration, obviously, had a policy toward the Soviet Union. Johnson had had
                    a long meeting with Prime Minister Kosygin (who was really the number-two man,
                    because Brezhnev was the Party Secretary, and then their President was the
                    number-one). He had a long meeting with Kosygin about the Middle East-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is at Glassboro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: At Glassboro, right, but they also talked about arms control,
                    military issues, what later became known at SALT (Strategic Arms Limitations
                    Talks), and also about the possibility of a treaty arrangement to prevent the
                    construction of anti-ballistic missile systems. The reason for that latter
                    discussion in the Johnson administration was not so much what has lately become
                    the key word - that this was going to be the key cornerstone of the whole
                    military relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union - but the fact was
                    that the Johnson administration's anti-ballistic missile system did not have
                    strong support in the Congress, and was being whittled away. In any case, the
                    arms control subjects were on the agenda. Then in 1968, the Soviets invaded
                    Czechoslovakia, and that put a hold, really, on everything that was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>My point in the memo to Kissinger was that if we moved in our relationship with
                    the Soviet Union, we ought to have a broader strategy of what we were trying to
                    accomplish, and not just pick raisins out the cake where it was possible to
                    maybe make a narrow or limited agreement. I thought that Nixon, with his
                    reputation as being strongly anti-communist, would actually have some bargaining
                    leverage vis-�-vis the Soviets, even though our deep involvement and very
                    divisive involvement in Vietnam did not make 1968-69 one of the more optimistic
                    periods in American attitudes. I thought we ought to approach the Soviets in a
                    more general way, take our time before we actually began any formal meetings
                    with them (the State Department wanted to move ahead more quickly), and see how
                    much we might be able to get from the Russians in the way of help in ending the
                    Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>Unbeknownst to me, Nixon and Kissinger had already talked about normalizing, or
                    trying to normalize relations with China. I also put into my brief paper the
                    possibility of having perhaps a more positive relationship with the Chinese,
                    since it was obvious that they and the Soviets were deeply divided. Although
                    this hadn't happened yet, later in 1969 they almost came to blows in their
                    border region. So I thought that with a new president, there might be an
                    opportunity to open some avenues of at least consultation. Nixon had said so in
                    his acceptance speech for the nomination of the Republican Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, it was sort of general wisdom within the
                        State Department and policy people, that there really was a difference
                        between the Soviet Union and the Communist Chinese.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think by this time it was accepted. It took a long time, as I said
                    earlier in our taping. Toward the end of the 1950s, the Sovietologists began to
                    see many signs of frictions, as did the Sinologists. It was generally not
                    accepted as real, or maybe as a big ruse to mislead the U.S. But above all, I
                    think people felt that two Marxist-Leninists states could not really have a
                    falling-out with each other, even though, of course, Marxist and Leninist
                    regimes had a long history of internal strife, of people being purged and
                    slaughtered by the thousands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, that whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. But by 1968, they were openly berating and accusing each
                    other, and they competed openly too. The Chinese were obstructing Soviet
                    military shipments to Vietnam. There were lots of things going on; so it was
                    pretty obvious. However, even though that was accepted by many people
                    (including, I think by this time, by Dean Rusk, who had been the most skeptical
                    about a Sino-Soviet split), nevertheless, in the State Department the feeling
                    was that we should be very cautious with the Chinese. While we had had certain
                    formal contacts between our ambassadors, which were actually publicized (first
                    in Prague, between Alex Johnson and the Chinese representative there; and then
                    in Warsaw, by Walter Stoessel, our ambassador to Poland, and the Chinese
                    ambassador there), the State Department was always meticulous in briefing the
                    Soviets about our talks with the Chinese in order not to lead the Soviets to
                    believe that we were trying to gang up on them with the Chinese. Whatever the
                    motivations for that may have been, that approach was endorsed by very
                    high-level people, like Ambassador Thompson; and I think Ambassador Bohlen had
                    similar feelings. So we briefed the Russians (that is, the State Department
                    did), even though the Soviets must have had the tapes of these conversations
                    from their listening devices, anyway-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -since the discussions took place in Prague and Warsaw! While they
                    accepted the Sino-Soviet split, our senior officials still tended to think that
                    the Soviet relationship was the more important; and that the desirability of
                    finding various opportunities (or “islands of cooperation,” as they were called)
                    with the Soviets was a desirable policy. They felt that we shouldn't make the
                    Soviets believe that we were trying to encircle them somehow by ties with China
                    on their Far Eastern front. But the split itself, I think, was widely accepted
                    by that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feeling with Henry Kissinger at that time,
                        of one that I've sort of had the sense of, that he saw the United States as
                        not being able to sort of sustain a confrontation with the Soviet Union? In
                        other words, it was sort of almost a cut your losses and try to get the
                        better, rather than we shall overcome, or not? I mean at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I'm not so sure. It was certainly a bad time because we, as a
                    country, were torn apart. We had the unending Vietnam War, although one of the
                    early efforts made by the Nixon administration was to figure out a way to
                    gradually extricate ourselves from Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Kissinger tended to get pictured as a Spenglerian who would become pessimistic
                    about the survival of the U.S. I think it was more the situation of the period,
                    in Nixon's case as well - that we had to do something to get out of this Vietnam
                    mess, which was dividing the country. So Nixon had a modest olive branch that he
                    put forward toward the Soviets during the election campaign. He figured he had
                    some leeway to do it because he was a certified anti-communist from way
                    back.</p>
                <p>I think the other reason was that having constant contact with the Soviets,
                    possibly working with them on a few things that might actually produce some
                    agreements, might take some of the wind out of the sails of the peace movement,
                    which was rampant all over the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of in a way?this was sort of the reality of
                        when you came in - you have to do something about this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. I think so. I think Kissinger agreed with that. But, of course,
                    in the back of Nixon's mind (and I think somewhere in the back of Kissinger's
                    mind, but Nixon had already written about it in Foreign Affairs, the magazine of
                    the Council on Foreign Relations, in 1968) - in the back of Nixon's mind was
                    also the idea of getting in touch with the Chinese, and therefore, maybe putting
                    some pressure on the Soviets from the eastern side. It was all still very much
                    in an embryonic state. They were trying to get some flexibility and mobility and
                    maneuverability into American foreign policy, which had become relatively
                    handicapped by the Vietnam war, and then by the fact that we couldn't talk to
                    the Soviets after their invasion of Czechoslovakia; and we really didn't have
                    any kind of relationship with the Chinese, and the Europeans were uneasy about
                    the Vietnam war. While NATO existed, of course, there wasn't the kind of vigor
                    in that alliance which had been the case in earlier years. Nixon and Kissinger
                    felt that they wanted to get some room for maneuver and some opportunities to
                    widen the scope of our diplomacy. The Soviet part of this played a role in their
                    minds, clearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you moved in after 20 January 1969, what sort
                        of apparatus did you have to deal with? I mean, here you have sort of
                        European as well as Soviet Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I had two or three people on my staff (maybe two, maybe we
                    added another one later). But the style of the Kissinger NSC staff - and this
                    has been written about now in several projects on the evolution of the NSC staff
                    since the early days of Truman and Eisenhower - Kissinger ran a pretty tight
                    shop, in the sense that he was going to be the only one who was going to deal
                    with the President. He didn't know Nixon very well at first, and he wanted to
                    establish himself with Nixon. The NSC staff in the Bundy and Rostow era in the
                    '60s had had some direct contact with Kennedy, and then even more with Johnson,
                    mostly on Vietnam, but on other issues, as well. [end of tape]</p>
                <p>Henry really didn't want to encourage that. He wanted to be the sole contact with
                    the President. At the beginning, he didn't even establish a Deputy position.
                    Alexander Haig, who came in as a military assistant, was not a Deputy. He was
                    still a Colonel at the time (as it happens, I had met him earlier in a couple of
                    contexts). Haig became a Deputy when Kissinger started his many secret missions
                    for talks with the Vietnamese and other travel, and somebody needed to hold the
                    fort back in Washington.</p>
                <p>In any case, the weight of policy formulation moved into the NSC staff, and it
                    created quite a bit of tension and friction with the State Department. It didn't
                    make life easy for people like myself. There were also several others who had
                    been assigned to the NSC staff from the State Department, whose salaries were
                    still paid by the Department.</p>
                <p>At the start, a whole flood of Study Memoranda were requested by the National
                    Security Advisor from the agencies involved - State Department, Defense
                    Department, CIA, a couple of other agencies - on different aspects of foreign
                    policy, including China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam (although most of that had
                    been done during the transition, on defense-related issues), and lots of other
                    topics. While the State Department fought very hard to maintain the chairmanship
                    of the interagency committees, it became pretty clear that the center of gravity
                    had shifted over to the White House. A lot of these studies kept a lot of people
                    busy. They played some role in policy formulation, but essentially, Nixon felt
                    so much at home in the foreign policy field that a lot of decision-making
                    occurred in the White House.</p>
                <p>The meetings of the NSC (National Security Council) itself were often sort of
                    formal sessions in which people were able to state their views and certainly
                    did. But then Nixon never made any announcements on policy decisions at an NSC
                    meeting. He listened to the discussion, participated in it, and then at some
                    point, a memorandum or a formal National Security Decision Memorandum (NSDM) was
                    drafted. He fiddled around with it, and that was then proclaimed from Mount
                    Sinai as the policy of the government. Sometimes the agencies weren't happy, and
                    sometimes they just accepted.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>I was active in that process, as were my colleagues who were responsible for Asia
                    and other geographic and functional areas. We helped on the drafting of these
                    NSDMs (National Security Decision Memoranda). Ultimately, Kissinger and I guess
                    Haig, or maybe somebody else in his immediate surrounding, worked on them and
                    then got them to Nixon, who then issued them. Then our function, and my function
                    in particular (but that of the others as well) - our function became to see that
                    these policy decisions were, in fact, carried out. That, too, involved an
                    interagency process, and that was chaired by the State Department (or, in the
                    military areas, by the Defense Department). We participated and tried to keep
                    things on the path which the President had indicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, you're sitting there. How do you find out? I
                        mean, it's a vast bureaucracy, and things are happening way beyond this. How
                        do you find out, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I guess in practice, when instructions started, say, going out
                    to our negotiating teams, wherever they were, they were supposed to be cleared
                    in the NSC staff. If we had a serious problem, we could try to negotiate with
                    the State Department people who were responsible; and if that was blocked, we
                    took it to Kissinger or Haig, who acted as a de facto Deputy, and then escalated
                    the discussion.</p>
                <p>There was an interagency group in which Elliott Richardson, the Under Secretary
                    of State (as it was still called in those days), represented the State
                    Department. That group sometimes met in a rump session to try to iron out some
                    differences. Telegrams were supposed to be cleared with us, and we also were on
                    the distribution of State Department traffic (whether we got everything, you
                    never know; but I think we got most of the important things); and then just
                    through conversations, and so on. But there were problems when the State
                    Department didn't quite seem to follow the line as we had interpreted it in the
                    President's decision, whatever might have been at stake.</p>
                <p>It took quite a while, for example, preparing for the Strategic Arms Limitations
                    Talks (SALT) and the negotiations on the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty,
                    where the process was as I described it. There were big studies, and so on.
                    Eventually, after discussions and debates at different levels, followed by
                    formal NSC or Deputies' meetings, a directive came out of the President's
                    office, which then had to be translated into a detailed negotiating position to
                    use with the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>The State Department was really quite impatient. Bill Rogers, the Secretary of
                    State, wanted to get started quite early in these negotiations with the Soviets.
                    Nixon and Kissinger just wanted to bide their time, see what was happening in
                    Vietnam, and not rush into these things. They wanted to string the Soviets along
                    a little more, keep them guessing; make them and not ourselves the demandeur,
                    even though, as I was saying earlier, we had a very problematic relationship
                    with the Congress and with the public here because of Vietnam and the peace
                    movement. The prospects for congressional funding of a missile defense program
                    were dim, with at best two, but more likely only one site likely to be
                    authorized.</p>
                <p>I had to assign one of my assistants - and somebody else in the NSC staff who was
                    more technically involved (my area was political) also had one of his people -
                    to participate in the interagency process that developed the instructions for
                    our negotiators on the Strategic Arms Limitation and the ABM Treaties. Of
                    course, after a while, the famous “back channel” was developed between the White
                    House and the Soviets, which supplemented and sometimes circumvented the formal
                    instructions. That worked through Kissinger and the Soviet Ambassador, Dobrynin.
                    Nixon and Dobrynin met, and by spring of 1970, there were some agreements made
                    in that channel, which were then somehow put on the formal negotiating table,
                    the front channel. Our people were quite disturbed when this happened without
                    their knowing about it. Sometimes they had problems with the substance as well
                    as the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, while you were dealing with Soviet Affairs,
                        aware of this back channel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was aware of a lot of it, but to this day, I'm not sure what else
                    may have occurred in these conversations and in the written exchanges between
                    Brezhnev and Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you knew something was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. Well, I knew when it came to the cases that I've just
                    described, the negotiations on strategic arms and on the ABM Treaty. I did know
                    that because I was directly involved (along with one of my, as I say, more
                    technically-competent NSC staff colleagues) in working with Kissinger, so that
                    when he talked with Dobrynin, he was on solid technical grounds. But our
                    official delegation was quite upset to discover that a lot of the issues that
                    they were working on in the front channel had, in fact, been dealt with behind
                    their backs. The Soviets often seemed to have kept their chief negotiator better
                    informed about what was going on in the “back channel” than we did. I think
                    Kissinger, in the meantime, has expressed some regret that we weren't more
                    meticulous in letting our own people know what was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were being asked this, “Let's get
                        together for lunch,” type of thing with people? State Department finding out
                        what is going on at the NSC through your colleagues at the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There was some of that, but the “back channel,” that was
                    sacreincidentally, not only with the Soviets. But either at lunch or when we ran
                    into each other at meetings, we talked. I think others on the staff talked also.
                    In my case, this was mostly about the Soviets. There were all these old Moscow
                    hands in the State Department, some of them at quite high levels, who officially
                    outranked me. It was awkward when there were some issues that I knew they had
                    not been kept informed on. I didn't consider it my job to violate the confidence
                    of the people that I was working for at that time. So it caused some friction. I
                    think the NSC staff people who dealt with China had somewhat similar problems
                    with their colleagues as that opening got underway in 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It wasn't easy. Of course, you'd known these people all your lives.
                    It eventually evened out. The big “back channel,” of course, was the secret
                    talks on Vietnam that Kissinger was conducting; and eventually it included
                    somebody from the State Department because the Secretary of State complained
                    about it-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was a system that suited Nixon; it was his style. He didn't think
                    much of the State Department, in general; and he was terribly worried about
                    leaks. And it suited Kissinger's style of conducting diplomacy; and in a way, it
                    suited the times, because the journalists in the Nixon White House, by and
                    large, were seen as anti-Nixon, and the “back channel” was less likely to
                    leak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Henry, however, cultivated some media people, and it caused some
                    problems for him with Nixon. There was also a rather tightly-run operation on
                    some issues with foreign governments. Representatives of some foreign
                    governments knew more about what we were trying to do than our own colleagues
                    did in other parts of our government, and than the people up on the Hill did.
                    But it was Nixon's and Kissinger's style, as I say; and it was a function of the
                    period.</p>

                        to when, by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: 'Til early '74, just about five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were looking at 21 January 1969, how did we view
                        the Soviet Union at that time? I mean, where was the Soviet - what was
                        motivating the Soviet Union? Where was it going? You know-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think we still had a rather traditional view - that is, that they
                    were accumulating power, military power; that they, despite Czechoslovakia and
                    other rumblings in Eastern Europe, wanted to continue to dominate the
                    Central-Eastern European empire. They were trying, while they had opportunities,
                    to drive some wedges between us and our European allies. But we also saw them
                    being active in different parts of the world. In Cuba, of course, this was
                    nearly seven years after the missile crisis, but their forces were still there;
                    and we had a few altercations with the Soviets because they seemed to be
                    violating the agreements made in the Kennedy administration about what kind of
                    forces they could keep in Cuba. They were active with their arms sales. They
                    were very much involved in the Middle East. They were beginning to have their
                    problems with China. All in all, I think we saw them as an ambitious growing
                    power. Comparisons were often made with the emerging imperial Germany, trying to
                    show the flag in lots of different places around the world. The Soviets also
                    were building a rather imposing navy.</p>
                <p>I think what we underestimated was the economic weakness of the system. I think
                    Nixon recognized this to some extent, because he was dangling some economic
                    goodies before the eyes of the Soviets. We eventually had a negotiation, which
                    was intended to give the Soviets most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment and also to
                    settle (on rather favorable terms) the old lend-lease debt that they still owed
                    us from World War II.</p>
                <p>So I think we saw them as a serious problem for us, but also as potentially
                    helpful in Vietnam, helpful only in the sense that they would further curtail
                    their military supplies, which were already being curtailed because of Chinese
                    obstruction. This business of the Soviets helping us on Vietnam was very much an
                    idea in the Johnson administration, and Averil Harriman was convinced that that
                    could be accomplished. In 1969, I think we were a little bit more sober about
                    that prospect. But President Nixon regarded the Soviets as our main problem in
                    the world, apart from Vietnam and the conflict in the Middle East (in which the
                    Soviets were involved), which was continuing at that time. It wasn't the
                    Palestinians, but it was Israel and Egypt and Syria and Iraq and Jordan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then towards the end of your time there we had the October

                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We had the Yom Kippur War; we'd had the '67 War. There was repeated
                    air combat between the Israelis and the Egyptians-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: War of Attrition really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: At his start in the White House, Kissinger had kept his hands off
                    the Middle East, and I think Nixon wanted him to keep his hands off. Then
                    gradually, especially after the Yom Kippur War, or really during the Yom Kippur
                    War in 1973, he got much more involved. It had been a big subject in one of the
                    summits between Nixon and Brezhnev earlier in 1973, when Brezhnev came over here
                    in return for Nixon's having gone to Moscow in 1972 for the first in their
                    series of summits. As he had been in Moscow, Brezhnev was very critical of our
                    Vietnam policy, but even more so of our Middle East policy. He kept warning that
                    this issue was a tinderbox. When the Yom Kippur War broke out later that year,
                    it looked, in retrospect, more like Brezhnev's warnings had been a threat. The
                    Soviets were deeply involved there.</p>
                <p>Actually, however, whenever there was a war or near-war in the Middle East, the
                    Soviets somehow evaporated, and this caused them a lot of problems in the Arab
                    world. They provided the Arabs with lots of military equipment and training.
                    They seemed to egg them on, very anti-Israeli, and made it appear that they
                    would be actively on their side if war broke out again. But the Soviets never
                    were activexcept that they pulled out many of their nationals before the
                    Egyptians launched their attack. We discovered this later.</p>
                <p>During the Yom Kippur War, I was with Kissinger, along with several other people,
                    in a long meeting Kissinger had in Moscow in October, 1973. We settled on a UN
                    resolution that was designed to end that conflict. So the Soviets were involved
                    quite a bit, generally not constructively. But at crisis times, they were the
                    partner that we were able to deal with to calm things down. This time, the
                    result was UN Resolution 338, which built on 242, with which the Six-Day War was
                    ended, but which never led to a full-fledged peace deal.</p>

                    when they were starting to do well against the Syrians as well as the Egyptians,
                    we thought we saw some Soviet uneasiness, and we were getting a bit concerned.
                    In '73, the Egyptians, of course, were doing very well at the start. We had the
                    problem of re-supplying the Israelis militarily, and there were some internal
                    disputes in the U.S. government about this.</p>
                <p>When this war started, the press bombarded Kissinger, especially in his press
                    conferences, with questions about, “What's all this detente about? Here the
                    Russians or Soviets are right up to their ears in egging on the Egyptians,
                    supplying them with military stuff,” and so on. Kissinger found himself on the
                    defensive because this sort of thing was not supposed to happen between the U.S.
                    and the Soviets.</p>
                <p>I was not sure. After we'd been in Moscow to negotiate Resolution 338, there was
                    a letter from Brezhnev that Dobrynin delivered by phone here one night. It
                    warned that the Israelis had to stop the fighting, or the U.S. and the Soviet
                    Union ought to, in effect, make them stop. The Israelis were supposed to stop,
                    according to the draft resolution that we and the Russians had worked out in
                    Moscow, which was later adopted by the UN Security Council. But they kept
                    fighting, almost surrounding an Egyptian army near the northern end of the Suez
                    Canal.</p>
                <p>At that time, I was in a group that met all through the night of October 25-26,
                    1973, when this Brezhnev message arrived. It was actually delivered only orally
                    by Dobrynin at first, and all we had was based on a telephone conversation. We
                    didn't have a formal letter. We weren't sure what they were up to. But some
                    intelligence indicated that their forces might be on the move at Soviet air
                    bases, to help the Egyptians; there were also reports of Soviet naval moves in
                    the Mediterranean. I wasn't sure what was going to happen.</p>
                <p>So the U.S. went on a heightened state of alert. It was not the highest alert, or
                    even near the highest, but still noticeably higher than it had been, to send a
                    warning signal to the Soviets. Then it turned out that they?backed away. They
                    got something out of their maneuver, because we agreed that they could have some
                    observers on the ground in Egypt, and we would also have observers in the Sinai
                    peninsula.</p>
                <p>All told, during this tense period I was not sure whether we were close to Soviet
                    intervention. I couldn't quite believe that they would want to get themselves
                    directly involved in this conflict; but I thought that it might be a domestic
                    issue in Moscow, to see their Arab allies defeated by the Israelis yet again,
                    with American help; and this could produce some perhaps-not-quite-rational
                    behavior on their part. I guess I toyed somewhat with the notion that, if we
                    showed them that we were not going to tolerate this, they would back away from
                    military action. But it's never been fully established how far they really were
                    going in their preparations, or whether they were just doing things as a feint
                    that would look to us as though they might intervene. They had a particular ship
                    that we were watching carefully in the eastern Mediterranean; and they were
                    active in moving their airborne troops, which we were able to detect through our
                    intelligence.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I thought we needed to take some precautions. In addition - something I was not
                    that directly involved in - I thought we needed to get the Israelis to stop
                    their effort to fully encircle the Egyptians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kissinger went to see Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir immediately
                    after our Moscow meetings. We flew to Israel to tell her what we had worked out
                    with the Russians, but I think Henry might also have winked a little bit at her
                    and indicated that she had just a couple of days, maybe, for Israeli forces to
                    continue, but then they'd have to stop. (I was not in Kissinger's meeting with
                    Gold Meir.) The Israelis kept going. The Soviets evidently started getting very
                    itchy. They probably suspected that our finger was in this, and that's what
                    produced this rather threatening message from Brezhnev, and maybe some of the
                    Soviet military moves. So it was an uncertain time, including in what was
                    becoming Watergate Washington.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I don't think the Soviets would have wanted to get involved,
                    either with the Israelis themselves, or least of all, with us. They weren't
                    ready to have a big conflict with us. Of course in our case, we were ending our
                    direct involvement in Vietnam, and not very gloriously. We were getting out from
                    under that, and we weren't looking for a conflict with the Soviets. But there
                    was enough there to cause concern-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our reading internally in the Soviet Union about
                        the Brezhnev group. Was Brezhnev really in charge of calling it and the role
                        of the military and </hi>

                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We saw a lot of him at the meetings in Moscow. Kissinger went to
                    Moscow in between summit meetings on several occasions, and I went with him. I
                    had also gone in the early summer of 1972 with our Secretary of Commerce, Peter
                    Peterson, for negotiations on MFN (Most Favored Nation treatment) and
                    lend-lease. So I had seen a lot of Brezhnev, and I had the feeling that he was
                    pretty confident. Occasionally, while we were in meetings, he'd pick up a phone
                    and call somebody. From what he was saying (not so much on trade questions, but
                    on the arms control business, and on Vietnam and maybe on the Middle East), he
                    seemed to be talking to Grechko, his Defense Minister, and it sounded as if
                    Brezhnev was on top. Everybody in his presence was deferential; so he looked
                    like he was pretty much in the saddle. But when things were moving in our talks,
                    he did check with some of his colleagues, sometimes within our earshot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: As in the earlier case of Khrushchev, the signs began to mount that
                    Brezhnev was in trouble, not so much from the military, but within the political
                    leadership. Then we did notice later, when Ford became President and we met in
                    1974 in Vladivostok with Brezhnev, that he was physically not in good shape. Of
                    course, he lived on for quite a while longer, but he didn't seem to have quite
                    the vigor and the confidence. Still, I think, since there wasn't any obvious
                    alternative to him at the time, no leader around whom the others might have
                    jelled, I think we thought he was pretty well in the saddle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we still playing the art of Kremlinology, watching
                        this Grechko?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, but you know, the policy-makers believe only what they see and
                    hear themselves-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: At least the non-Soviet expert ones. But the Sovietologists were
                    busy as bees, looking for signs (and there clearly were some signs) of
                    maneuverings. They weren't so much against Brezhnev, I don't think. (This has
                    all been written up in the meantime, because a lot of this has been publicized.)
                    The Kremlinologists were busy. The Soviet Union had opened up a little bit more,
                    so there was a bit more access than in the old days to some quite high-ranking
                    people. And they had also started to develop more think-tanks in Moscow,
                    particularly one dealing with the U.S.A., headed by Georgy Arbatov.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Canadian-American Institute [Institute for U.S. and
                        Canadian Studies].</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. Arbatov and their people came over here quite a bit, and some
                    of our people went over there. In those days, we gradually began developing
                    contacts among American researchers, American scholars, Soviet scholars, and
                    some Soviet officials. It wasn't anything like it became later, but our
                    Sovietologists were able to get a bit more first-hand information than they had
                    in the past, when they had to pore through broadcasts and newspapers and books
                    and journals, checking key phrases. The intelligence people occasionally picked
                    up some snippets of conversations. But yes, Kremlinology was still quite an
                    active profession.</p>
                <p>The problem with the Sovietologists - those who were really buried deep in this
                    stuff with their heads in green eyeshades - was that what they produced wasn't
                    always particularly relevant to what was on the minds of the policy-makers.
                    Later, policy-makers were able to make better use of what they were able to
                    discern about Soviet internal politics and maneuvering. The group of officials
                    active in designing policies, and our other officials and high-level people who
                    had dealings at the highest levels in the Soviet hierarchy, were briefed on
                    things that they should look for: how someone like Party Secretary Suslov would
                    act in the presence of Brezhnev, how Premier Kosygin would act in the presence
                    of Brezhnev, and so on; and how they were aligned across the table from us. All
                    these things were of interest. The policy-makers and policy-executors became a
                    bit more familiar with the Sovietologists' tools of the trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviets have the equivalent of an NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No. Brezhnev had a foreign policy and national security advisor
                    nameAlexandrov-Agentov. He was smart and spoke English well, and he had some
                    high-level connections. There were two or three others whom we saw on German
                    policy, which was very important to them. They had two or three people in Moscow
                    who were experts, but they didn't have a structure like our NSC. Of course, they
                    had the Politburo and the Secretariat of the Politburo, which had foreign policy
                    experts. In that sense, they did have a sort of structure, but it wasn't quite
                    the same as ours, and it was pretty much embedded in the Communist Party. In
                    thParty Secretariat, the secretary in charge of international relations, part of
                    his brief was dealing with foreign Communist parties and Communist-run
                    governments. But the other part of his brief was to work for the Politburo on
                    foreign policy issues. So they had a structure, but it was more focused on the
                    party than the government. Their Foreign Office had influence only if the
                    Minister was a member of the Politburo, although some Soviet career ambassadorin
                    Washington or Bonhad a direct line to the Kremlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Berlin play - was Berlin pretty well settled by the
                        time that </hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, no. We still had various altercations, but mostly on the
                    access routes to the city, which was completely surrounded by Communist East
                    Germany. There was, in our second year, the quadripartite negotiation on Berlin
                    (involving the U.S., USSR, Great Britain and France) because there had been an
                    accumulation of incidents. By 1970, the Nixon-Brezhnev contact had been made and
                    a new government formed in Germany, headed by Chancellor WillBrandt (a coalition
                    between the Social Democrats and the Liberal Democrats). Their Ostpolitik
                    (Eastern policy) became more active. Then Berlin became one of the serious
                    sources of friction. We felt, and I guess the Soviets felt, certainly Germans
                    did, that we ought to do something about those tensions.</p>
                <p>There was no longer the old Khrushchevian effort to establish West Berlin as a
                    free city, and make it sort of a formal enclave. But the Berlin Wall remained.
                    An agreement was reached in the early fall of 1971, the Quadripartite Agreement,
                    that regulated more systematically the way access was to be handled between the
                    Western zones and West Berlin. It also stipulated that West Berlin could not
                    function as the capital of Germany. The Germans, actually, had moved some
                    official functions to Berlin, mostly for reasons of subsidizing Berlin activity
                    and business. They had some governmental offices assigned to Berlin. The
                    Bundestag, their parliament, and its committees met there periodically in the
                    old Reichstag building, and so on. The Soviets always complained bitterly that
                    the Germans were violating the idea that the Federal Republic of Germany was not
                    to be governed from Berlin.</p>
                <p>The Germans considered Berlin a “land” (state) of the Federal Republic, but it
                    did not have the same rights as the states that made up the rump of the Federal
                    Republic of Germany. So periodic frictions and incidents occurred. The Germans
                    became quite active in their relations with the Soviets. That became
                    controversial in partisan terms in Germany after Brandt became Chancellor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is Ostpolitik.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. The CDU (Christian Democratic Union), which had led the German
                    government for so long, and the CSU (Christian Socialist Union), the Bavarian
                    branch or Bavarian associate of the Christian Democrats, were very suspicious
                    that the Social Democrats were giving away too much to thSoviets. They were very
                    suspicious of Brandt, himself, and of his close confidant, Egon Bahr.</p>
                <p>As for the U.S. government, we wanted to keep things quiet. We didn't want to see
                    the West Germans go too far in their relations with the Soviets, but we
                    understood that, for their own political reasons, they wanted to have a more
                    normal relationship. We didn't want to have incidents on the Autobahn if we
                    could possibly avoid it.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>Then there was the broader question of how to deal with East Germany, the GDR
                    (German Democratic Republic). Of course, the East Germans were originally
                    ostracized by the West Germans, but the West Germans gradually normalized
                    relations with the East Germans. Both became members of the United Nations. We
                    began to have contact, and eventually we and other NATO countries also
                    established diplomatic missions in East Germany, in effect, accepting that for
                    the foreseeable future, East Germany was going to be separate from West Germany.
                    There were the Berlin Wall, and the mined tracts in the East along the border
                    with West Germany. We accepted that they were separate countries. Now this was
                    in the mid -'70s. Fifteen years later, it all changed.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There were some rumblings in those days, mostly in Poland, but also
                    elsewhere: Czechoslovakia after '68, Hungary, and Romania were problems for the
                    Soviets. We had dealings with Romania quite early in the Nixon administration.
                    The President made a big state visit to Bucharest in 1969, not because we found
                    their leader, Ceausescu, so delicious and likeable, but he was a thorn in the
                    side of the Soviets. He became something of a channel, occasionally, for us on
                    Chinese and other matters.</p>
                <p>But Germany looked as though it was going to remain divided. Brandt thought so,
                    and we thought so, and pretty much everybody else did too. The division seemed
                    to suit everybody. The West Europeans weren't particularly keen on German
                    unification, although we signed annual NATO and other communiqu�s that declared
                    this as our goal.</p>
                <p>I would say that after the 1971 Quadripartite Agreement, to go back to your
                    original question, Berlin was a less acute problem. There were incidents from
                    time to time, mostly having to do with access rights, and the Soviets were
                    getting annoyed and irritated at the Germans for having too many official
                    activities in West Berlin. But it really was not a big issue. It remained an
                    issue, of course, but it was episodic. There were a lot of subsidies to keep
                    West Berlin going, and it cost the West Germans a lot. Increasingly, West Berlin
                    became not just an isolated outpost, but a very modern city compared to East
                    Berlin and the rest of East Germany. So it was often held up as the symbol of
                    what you can accomplish in a democratic system and in a free market society.</p>
                <p>The big issue in Europe became the Soviet SS-20 medium-range missiles, which
                    started on our watch, but became much more pronounced later on.</p>

                        you were there? Should we just - do you want to start talking about
                        that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, let's quickly say something about that and then maybe continue
                    next time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Years earlier, in 1954, prospects began to develop for West Germany
                    to become part of NATO, because the proposed European Defense Community (which
                    would have included West Germany) had been vetoed by France. The EDC had been
                    seen as the way to include some West German military forces within the context
                    of a European forcwhich is kind of interesting because as we talk now, in 2001,
                    the Europeans are trying to recreate a European force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: French wishing it again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But at that time, in 1954, the French vetoed the EDC. The Germans
                    then, as a result of various agreements, were to become NATO members in 1955. In
                    answer to that, the Soviets threatened to create their own alliance in the East,
                    but they also proposed an all-European security conference in which these
                    alliances would all disappear. That was not acceptable to us or to our NATO
                    allies.</p>
                <p>This particular Soviet proposal was sort of a typical Soviet propaganda ploy, but
                    I think it did, in fact, have some substance, in their minds at least, because
                    they were quite anxious about the West Germans re-arming and becoming part of
                    the Western (NATO) alliance. This rattled around for years and was a stock
                    proposal by the Russians.</p>
                <p>Then, after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in '68, they really gave it a
                    lot of emphasis. By that time, even despite Czechoslovakia, there had developed
                    a certain interest in Europe in perhaps having some sort of an all-European
                    forum, but not at the expense of NATO. The Scandinavians were interested in it;
                    some of the smaller Western European countries were interested in it. Other West
                    European countries were evolving and improving their relations with the Soviets.
                    We were starting to pursue a policy called detente; it was in its early stages.
                    So the Soviets revived this proposal. It still proved to be unacceptable, and we
                    were really not interested.</p>
                <p>NATO, as a result of the 1967 Harmel Report (I had been the U.S. representative
                    in drafting this document) had expanded its agenda from largely military issues
                    to discussions of political relations with the Warsaw Pact countries. The North
                    Atlantic Council became the NATO body for dealing with the Soviet proposals.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>In the spring of 1969, when NATO observed its 20th anniversary here in
                    Washington, it was obvious that there was some interest in Europe in having a
                    forum to discuss issues with the Soviets and the East Europeans. In fact, some
                    Europeans maybe saw it as a way of weaning the East Europeans away from the
                    Soviet Union a bit. We had a very active and observant, skillful Ambassador to
                    NATO in Brussels at the time, Harlan Cleveland, who had been named to that post
                    during the Johnson administration. (He was replaced by Bob Ellsworth later in
                    the Nixon administration.) Cleveland thought that it was probably going to be
                    difficult for the U.S. to block some action on the Russian proposal. The NATO
                    anniversary meeting was mildly responsive.</p>
                <p>Two years later, a preparatory committee was created, including both Easterners
                    and Westerners, to set an agenda for a broad East-West conference. The general
                    sense was that this shouldn't deal only with security issues, but should also
                    deal with what we'd call human rights issues. So there was a major new agenda
                    item added, having to do with freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom
                    of movement, and so on, which was more of a Western agenda. I don't think the
                    White House was that keenly interested in it, but we sort of came around to
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, only mildly </p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, it didn't seem very important to him. But I felt, I have to
                    say, that we had to move in this direction. By 1973, we were having negotiations
                    with the Soviets on arms control and summit meetings, and others had talked with
                    the Russians since the 1960s: the French had a consultation agreement with the
                    Soviets; West German Chancellor Brandt had the Ostpolitik, and so on; the
                    Italians had some contact with the Soviets and East Europeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just stop here to-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. [end of tape]</p>
                <p>The upshot of it was that there was a preparatory meeting in Helsinki in 1973,
                    and a full conference to negotiate a text then convened in Geneva; and we had
                    our representatives there. The NATO Council became the coordinating mechanism
                    for the NATO members to agree on common positions on the different agenda items,
                    or “baskets,” that they were discussing in this conference.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>Later in 1973, the Soviets started calling for an all-European summit meeting to
                    give this conference some momentum and impetus. Willy Brandt seemed to be
                    interested in having such a meeting. We weren't very keen on having a huge gala
                    summit at that point. Kissinger, because of Middle East problems, really wanted
                    to use the prospect of a possible all-European summit meeting as an inducement
                    for Brezhnev to behave himself as far as the Middle East was concerned.
                    Kissinger was linking progress on two unrelated issues - this is where the word
                    “linkage” came into common usage. We were also trying to slow down the Brandt
                    government as far as any summit was concerned. We weren't saying no; we weren't
                    saying yes, certainly; we wanted to keep the idea afloat and keep it hanging out
                    there as a carrot for Brezhnev.</p>
                <p>But some European leaders thought this European conference (it came to be called
                    the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, or CSCE), had an intrinsic
                    importance in reducing tensions across the Iron Curtain and opening the Iron
                    Curtain to some extent. So there was something of a difference between our
                    approach and those of some westerEuropeans, as well as that of the Russians. The
                    neutrals of Europe were also parties, and they liked the idea of a summit.</p>
                <p>I think the historians and journalists who have subsequently written about this
                    have still not quite caught the shift, the subtle shift in American policy.
                    Initially, we didn't like the idea because we thought the Europeans were going
                    to be hard to keep in line because of domestic pressures in their countries. We
                    were concerned that there would be all sorts of unnecessary divisions and
                    arguments between us and the Europeans, and also among the Europeans. But I
                    don't think our opposition, or Kissinger's, was as hard as is often pictured. I
                    mean, Kissinger certainly wasn't an enthusiast. But eventually the thing became
                    a reality, and we worked very hard to influence the draft. In fact, our
                    delegates to this conference played an increasingly active role in the drafting
                    of all the complicated clauses in the various “baskets,” and the U.S. became a
                    key participant in the work on what became the Helsinki Final Act, adopted in
                    1975.</p>
                <p>In fact, toward the end, the Germans became concerned about the Soviet-proposed
                    language about “permanent, unchangeable” borders - specifically, that national
                    borders were inviolate and couldn't be changed by force or any other way. They
                    worried on two grounds. Genscher-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the Foreign Minister.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The German Foreign Minister and his intimates there in the Bonn
                    Foreign Ministry, and I guess Chancellor Brandt until he had to resign in 1973,
                    but also his successor, Helmut Schmidt - they were concerned that the draft
                    language about frontiers in the document that they were negotiating would
                    ultimately make it impossible to reunite Germany, because borders were going to
                    be fixed and inviolable. The West Germans were also thinking ahead about the
                    European Economic Community, and that someday it might become more of a
                    sovereign entity. So they wanted to have some language that was more flexible on
                    frontiers. But the Soviets stonewalled, as did some others in Eastern
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>So the Germans came to us for help. Kissinger and I, as it happened, were
                    visiting in Bonn. Genscher and two or three of his people took us on a boat ride
                    up the Rhine for a Sunday afternoon coffee-klatch in one of those old castles
                    there. They said they had tried repeatedly to get more flexible language into
                    the proposed document, and they really needed us to put our weight behind this.
                    We reached some understanding with the Germans that we probably couldn't do it
                    in the precise section of the draft document where the language about borders
                    was then placed, but that we could try in some other part of the document to
                    indicate agreement that national borders could be changed if both parties, or
                    all affected parties, were willing to do that, and did it by peaceful means and
                    in conformity with international law. The Germans thought that was a good idea
                    and was worth trying. Then we took it up with the Soviets, through the “back
                    channel” first, and eventually at the negotiations in Geneva itself, to see if
                    we could get this kind of language into what became the “Helsinki Final Act.” We
                    succeeded, and got it into the Preamble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Germans were very satisfied with that. This was a case, one of
                    several, where the Americans played a major role behind the scenes in getting
                    the Helsinki agreement wrapped up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we were much more involved positively than.—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often you get the accounts that Kissinger was more or less
                        negative </hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, but I think mostly for tactical reasons. It also is the case,
                    you know, that back in Washington, the administration (the Ford administration
                    by that time) was severely criticized by the right wing of the Republicans for
                    selling out - selling out on frontiers, and selling out on a lot of things to
                    the Soviets. There were critical editorials and op-ed columns, notably by Bill
                    Safire (who'd been Nixon's speechwriter, but by that time was writing his own
                    column in the New York Times), but also by lots of others. So I think there was
                    some understandable caution in how far we should go with this. We actually
                    decided in 1975 that the negotiations had gone far enough, that we'd gotten a
                    lot from the Soviets on different issues - freedom of the press, freedom of
                    movement, and so forth. So we held a major summit meeting in Helsinki to sign
                    it.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing, and the ironic thing is that - despite the opposition to
                    the Helsinki Final Act by many organizations in the U.S. concerned with the
                    plight of oppressed peoples in Eastern Europe - the East Europeans themselves
                    proved very skillful in using the language of the Helsinki Final Act to improve
                    their situations. For example, the “Charter 77” movement in Czechoslovakia-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we're talking about the opponents to the regimes
                        within the East European </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. Many East Europeans were very skillfully using the Helsinki
                    wording to form organizations and to express themselves; and dissidents in the
                    Soviet Union did that as well. I don't go as far as a lot of other people do,
                    that is, to say that the Helsinki Final Act was the basic reason why the Soviet
                    empire in Eastern Europe collapsed. I think there were many reasons for that
                    collapse. But it is interesting that, contrary to most of the criticisms - that
                    we'd sold out to the Russians, that these East European “satellite” people had
                    been enslaved permanently-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is July 27, 2001. Hal, we're still at the NSC, '69-'74. Again, how did the
                    opening to China - I mean, you're dealing with the Soviet Union. Did you have
                    any sort of input beforehand of saying, “Okay, this is, you know, helping
                    develop manufacturing the China card,” or did this sort of come out? How did it
                    come out to you?</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I had very little direct involvement in the actual opening to
                    China when it began concretely with the secret Kissinger trip to Beijing in the
                    summer of 1971. I had had some involvement in discussions early in the Nixon
                    administration, when there were thoughts that had been foreshadowed by Nixon's
                    famous article in Foreign Affairs in 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to his becoming President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. In early 1969, there were thoughts about how we go about
                    getting some more flexibility in our policy toward China, and get more contact
                    with them, and so on. One of the National Security Study Memoranda was sent out
                    by the NSC staff to the various government agencies involved. Several weeks of
                    study produced very modest recommendations because, in fact, the State
                    Department (in general and traditionally) was extremely reluctant to get
                    involved with the Chinese; they were focused on the Soviet Union. State didn't
                    object - in fact, they couldn't object - to years of rather formalistic,
                    ritualistic contacts that we had with the Chinese through our ambassadors in
                    Czechoslovakia and then in Warsaw and one or two other places; but they were not
                    eager to do much with the Chinese. They also de-briefed the Soviets on those
                    contacts, to assuage their suspicions. So the agencies came up with some very
                    modest ideas, but they were certainly not eager.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>But there were some mild signals sent from the U.S. to the Chinese. The one I've
                    always liked involved an issue of importing Chinese pig bristles for shaving
                    brushes. That was banned by American trade legislation at the time. One of the
                    so-called signals that was sent early on in the Nixon administration was to lift
                    the restriction or to reduce the tariffs on pig bristles. There were one or two
                    other things. I don't recall the details because it wasn't really my area.
                    Kissinger and Nixon were not only secretive toward the rest of the government,
                    but within the White House staff setup and the National Security Council staff
                    setup, there was a good bit of compartmentalization. While I had some general
                    idea of what was happening, I really wasn't directly involved with the opening
                    to China.</p>
                <p>Actually, several of us were in San Clemente with Nixon in the summer of 1971
                    when the announcement was made that Kissinger had been in Beijing and was coming
                    back and was going to give a press conference there. After Kissinger had
                    finished with his China visit, I put together some things that hadn't made sense
                    to me before that; and I realized what was going on. From my own standpoint
                    regarding our relations with the Soviet Union and the reaction of the Soviets,
                    the relationship between China and the Soviet Union really was very difficult
                    and very bad; and, in fact, they had almost come to blows less than two years
                    earlier-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it had come to blows as a matter of fact-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In fact, they did-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?over the Ussuri River, or whatever it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, the Ussuri River and border issues. They kept up the
                    polemics: there were major differences between them on the Vietnam War; the
                    Chinese interfered with Soviet military supplies going through China to North
                    Vietnam, and so on. So their relationship was really pretty bad.</p>
                <p>My own sense of it was that if something was going to develop with China, we
                    couldn't really tell at the time, even though Kissinger's talks in Beijing had
                    sort of laid out an agenda and prepared for a Nixon visit. The President's trip
                    to China took place in February of 1972, while we were also working on the first
                    Nixon-Brezhnev summit. My feeling was that this contact with China would give
                    the Soviets something to think about; that maybe they couldn't rely much longer
                    on a situation of major hostility between the U.S. and China; and that this
                    could be of some help in getting the Soviets to play ball on some issues that we
                    were interested in. That was rather a simple-minded view of this emerging
                    triangular relationship, as it was later called.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place, in the NSA, or in NSC, or even
                        State Department, was there anyone sort of given the job of looking at the
                        China-Soviet relations and watching that closely, or was this sort of, you
                        know, both sides, both the Soviet experts and the Chinese experts were kind
                        of doing their thing, and it was kind of put together haphazardly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, looking at that Chinese-Soviet relationship was, of course, a
                    major matter in the intelligence community. Donald Zagoria, one of the CIA's
                    leading experts on China and on China-Soviet relations, had written a study at
                    CIA in the late 1950s which collated a huge volume of material, mostly public
                    material, but also inferences from what was happening in Sino-Soviet relations.
                    That was eventually declassified and published as a book and caused quite a
                    stir. Zagoria was later a professor at Columbia University. His was the first
                    major study on Sino-Soviet tensions and frictions and potential enmity. It was
                    very controversial because it ran right against the standard theology that
                    Marxists may quarrel, but they stick together. So all through the '60s, when I
                    was still in the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research and
                    running the Soviet Research Office there, we spent a lot of time tracking
                    whatever we could in Sino-Soviet relations. It was obvious that they were
                    getting worse, and it became quite public in what they were saying to and about
                    each other.</p>
                <p>Now in policy terms, what that meant for us in the Johnson administration, when
                    Dean Rusk was Secretary of State, and I think also in the Kennedy and Johnson
                    NSC staff under McGeorgBundy and Walt Rostow: there was still some skepticism
                    about how far the Sino-Soviet rift was really going, and considerable reluctance
                    to even think very much about the policy implications of it. It really became a
                    central question only when Nixon became President. He had already written
                    publicly about it. Kissinger hadn't said anything very much publicly about
                    Sino-Soviet relations, but it was obviously something that appealed to both of
                    them. Without the profound Sino-Soviet tension - friction, conflict, division,
                    gulf, rift, whatever you want to call it - then almost coming to a serious
                    military clash, which posed all sorts of issues for the United States in 1969 -
                    I think on the policy side, the implications for American interests and American
                    policy were not, in my view and certainly not in my recollections, seriously
                    addressed until the Nixon people came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, did you find - '71 you were in there and you
                        gave your initial reaction to this. I mean, did this become, sort of, within
                        the NSC or within the agencies supporting you, a major leit motif or
                        whatever it is? How do we play this China thing? Or was it just another
                        factor or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was a very major thing! It was also controversial in the country
                    here, because it was mostly interpreted, I think, that Nixon was really seeking
                    a way to get out of Vietnam somehow, to break open that alliance, and maybe to
                    get Chinese help in that, since the Soviets didn't seem to mind our being stuck
                    in Vietnam. There had been theories about getting Soviet help in ending the
                    Vietnam War when Averil Harriman was handling it in the Johnson years.</p>
                <p>By 1969, it was becoming a major issue. And of course, their cover had been
                    blown; the Sino-Soviet tension was now semi-public. Not every part of it was
                    public, but in 1971, the fact that Kissinger had visited China was made public.
                    At that point, it was a major issue of discussion. There were people in the
                    Congress who were skeptical about China. There were still theories that the
                    apparent conflict was all a big snow job that the Soviets and the Chinese were
                    putting on to lure us into whatever flawed policy we would then conduct. But I
                    think there were signs that the Soviets were really quite uneasy about the
                    situation. On the other hand, it also has to be said that Nixon and Kissinger,
                    to the extent that I had any input on this, did not seek to deliberately
                    humiliate or provoke the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I thought, first of all, that was a dangerous game to play-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very dangerous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -but they wanted another string to their bow. The opening to China
                    wasn't just a Soviet-related initiative. It also had to do with the fact that
                    China was a big country and was someday going to be a major actor, and we were
                    on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean, and we needed to have contact with them.
                    So it wasn't only the tactical considerations involved in Vietnam or an effort
                    to get more room for maneuver in our relations with the Soviets. I think there
                    was an underlying view as well: that is, that the U.S. really cannot do well in
                    world politics, and in particular, in advancing its Pacific region policies and
                    interests, without having some kind of relationship with China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did issues bubble up? Say, okay, now we've got
                        this new relationship. I mean I'm coming from your [perspective] or from the
                        NSC. Maybe now is the time to raise this issue; maybe the Soviets will be
                        more forthcoming. I mean, was this part of your calculations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, we were watching. We were watching whether the Russians would
                    be suspicious and maybe more difficult to deal with, or whether they were maybe
                    trying to avoid having our relationship with the Chinese become intimate and
                    detrimental to their own interests. They couldn't tell where the United States
                    was going to be in case some conflict should break out between them and the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're sort of talking about a time when they really
                        weren't getting on-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, their relationship was very bad! And it wasn't getting any
                    better.</p>
                <p>There had been times in the past when Americans and Soviets were taking tentative
                    soundings of each other about maybe doing something jointly about the Chinese
                    nuclear program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Some of this is in the public domain now-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -because of freedom of information requests, documentation, and
                    other information that has been obtained by historians and experts, and some has
                    been released. But, you know, when Nixon was at the summit with Brezhnev in May
                    of 1972, at the last meeting, Brezhnev slipped Nixon a proposal which amounted
                    to a semi-alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union against China. It
                    wasn't that crude and blunt, but that was the essence of it. It was a proposal
                    on the prevention of nuclear war. Nixon said he'd look at it, and later, after
                    that summit meeting, we worked with it and massaged it and took out the obvious
                    anti-Chinese implications and the anti-Chinese sting.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>The Soviets were still apparently hoping that they could draw the U.S. into some
                    sort of a de facto alliance or coalition against the Chinese; but of course, by
                    that time, the American relationship with China was becoming more interesting.
                    Eventually, we were able to put some intelligence-gathering equipment in China,
                    especially some devices to monitor Soviet compliance with the nuclear test ban,
                    which had been signed in the Kennedy administration. So we actually developed
                    something that might be called a moderate or modest U.S.-Chinese relationship
                    (nowadays we'd call it a “strategic partnership.”) But we and the Chinese more
                    or less agreed that the Soviets were a mutual problem. It had different aspects
                    for the Chinese because they were neighbors, but both we and the Chinese each
                    had difficulties with the Soviets; and therefore, we sought to work together,
                    not crudely, crassly, or obviously, but still working together, to contain the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you - you're sort of getting down to kind of the
                        personal level. I mean you're part of a cadre of Soviet experts who'd been
                        dealing with this, and all of a sudden this China relationship opens up. I
                        think one of the things that [I've found] as I've interviewed people
                        involved with this, is almost the infatuation of so many of the people who
                        got involved in the opening, including Kissinger and Nixon in a great
                        political capital and this is used; but did you feel in a way your nose is a
                        little out of joint, that maybe they were putting too much into this China
                        relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, my nose wasn't out of joint, because I thought it was, all in
                    all, a sensible strategy. I was a little uneasy about the sort of romanticism
                    toward China that developed, not just in the government, but elsewhere in the
                    U.S. There were people in the media, in the Congress, and elsewhere, who raised
                    cautions. They said, “Hey, China is a totalitarian dictatorship; and okay, the
                    Soviets are a big threat, and it makes sense to have some relationship with the
                    Chinese. But it's a pretty bad lot there, when all is said and done. They're
                    unreconstructed Communists, and they just took some horrendous actions against
                    their own people” (what would be called human rights violations now), “and they
                    are still committing them,” and so on.</p>
                <p>I think I tended to be sober about the new relationship, but then I wasn't
                    treated until a bit later to the charms of the Chinese people that Nixon and
                    Kissinger were dealing with. I mean, everybody was impressed with Zhou En-lai,
                    and also to some extent with Mao Zedong and some of the others. Those Americans
                    who started to have contact with them were impressed by their sophistication,
                    compared to the Soviets for example, and their subtleties. You can read all that
                    in Kissinger's memoirs, and to some extent in Nixon's memoirs.</p>

                <p>I didn't have that exposure until later, when I went on a couple of trips to
                    China with Kissinger. Unfortunately, Zhou En-lai was out of commission by then,
                    but I did meet Mao and Deng Xiaoping and some of the other senior people. It was
                    interesting to me how they differed, in style and their general demeanor, from
                    the Soviets that we were dealing with. But I have to say, I don't think I became
                    enamored of the system there in the PRC. It was obvious when you set foot in
                    China - there was some press comment on this at the time of Nixon's visit to
                    China - how regimented the society was: if only when everyone was wearing the
                    same clothes, at least in Beijing.</p>
                <p>The press couldn't get outside Beijing. It was clear that this was a very
                    tightly-run system in China vis-�-vis the population at large. I believe some
                    commentaries pointed out that this was at least as forbidding and totalitarian a
                    regime as the Soviets. But national interests override these sorts of thing.
                    Those were some of the comments from journalists and gurus in what's now called
                    the think-tank world, who had their hesitations. I would guess there were
                    similar reactions in the State Department also, maybe less so from the old China
                    hands, who finally could be put to use. Chinese language skills and all the
                    Chinese area knowledge became something that had practical utility, because we
                    set up a liaison office in Beijing and had contacts with Chinese officials on a
                    broader and more regular basis. So some people who had been looking at China
                    from afar, or through Taiwan, got to be very much in demand to deal with what
                    gradually and steadily became a pretty broad relationship with the Chinese, even
                    though we continued to have fundamental differences with them.</p>
                <p>On the Soviet side, as I say, they were uneasy about it. Brezhnev gave us long
                    lectures about how difficult and inscrutable the Chinese were. He said he had a
                    brother who knew them better than he (Brezhnev) did. The brother just said that
                    he could never understand these people, anBrezhnev himself agreed. There was
                    sort of a “yellow peril” [racial fear] aspect to all of this; and he never quite
                    stopped trying to wean us away from the Chinese and reminding us that we had a
                    common interest in dealing with these hundreds of millions of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you went with the Nixon-Brezhnev meeting, in
                        '72 was it? Was it in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, because this China relationship is new and
                        also other relationships, did you find your Soviet counterparts sort of with
                        their time when they sort of get together and say, “You know, what's
                        happening?” you know, I mean trying to sound you out because I would imagine
                        they would be nervous.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, they didn't want to show their nervousness, but there was some
                    of that. Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador here in Washington, was very agile. He
                    was the Washington end of the Soviet part of the “back channel” between the
                    White House and the Kremlin. Now, I can't vouch that he didn't try to find out
                    from his conversations with Kissinger and one or two others what really was
                    happening in U.S.-Chinese relations. The Soviets were keenly interested, and
                    suspicious. They were uneasy and tried to follow as best they could what was
                    happening in American-Chinese relations. I assume their espionage and
                    intelligence apparatus tried to get as much information as they could so that
                    they could get some grasp and grip on just how much substance there was to the
                    American-Chinese relationship, or whether it was just something intended to
                    needle them.</p>
                <p>As for Brezhnev: I may have forgotten or be mistaken, but I don't think that
                    there was a serious conversation between Nixon and Brezhnev in which Nixon tried
                    to explain in detail what he was about with the Chinese. It came up, and Nixon,
                    earlier in his term, had made a public statement about the five
                    mutually-balancing powers in the world, which were the United States, the Soviet
                    Union, China, Japan, and Europe. He already treated Europe as though it was a
                    unified whole. Nixon's notion was actually quite extraordinary in the early
                    '70s, because he seemed to put our European allies in the same category as the
                    Chinese Communists, the Soviet Communists, and our Japanese allies. He was
                    remarkable, also, because of his sense that power balances in the world are the
                    best guarantee for peace. This is a controversial subject in American politics
                    and American historiography. That was what Nixon was saying when, in fact,
                    “balance of power” as a notion was something of a dirty word in this country. It
                    was what the Europeans used to practice and as a result, they constantly had
                    wars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But as Nixon seemed to see it, we were not going to fall into that
                    trap. In fact, starting with the American Revolution in the late eighteenth
                    century, we had played a very skillful balance of power game ourselves. But it
                    was a dirty word, and to some extent still is - the “classic balance of power”
                    which produced constant wars.</p>
                <p>So, I think Nixon wasn't looking for a unique or special relationship with China,
                    and he wasn't giving up on having a tolerable relationship with the Soviets in
                    which there was some mutual interest and mutual benefit. After all, the Soviets
                    were the more powerful of the two, and were the nuclear giant opposing us. The
                    Chinese at that point were in a very, very modest stage of their development; so
                    the Soviet Union was the major factor. I think the administration tried to play
                    a cautious trilateral game involving China and the Soviet Union and, I think,
                    hoping to get some benefits in terms of the policies of both China and the
                    Soviet Union toward us. The idea, as was repeatedly said, was that we want to
                    have better relationships with each of them than they have with each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That was a sort of mantra at the time. Now, in the Bush
                    administration, as we are speaking here in 2001, some people are asking what
                    happened to that great Nixonian-Kissingerian wisdom, having better relations
                    with each of them than they have with each other. At the moment, it doesn't look
                    that way. The Russians and Chinese have a new treaty; they do this and that with
                    each other; Moscow sells arms in huge quantities to the Chinese; and we have
                    difficulties with both of them. I think that notion, of having better relations
                    with each of them than they have with each other, was not just a slogan, but I
                    think was a working strategy at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did Kissinger, in early days of when this
                        relationship opened up, talk, sort of to the NSC, particularly those dealing
                        with the Soviet Union and trying to lay it out, so don't - You know, here's
                        what we're trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The NSC staff didn't have meetings, where, you know, it was
                    show-and-tell time where everybody was briefed or informed. A lot of it was by
                    osmosis, and some of it just came up in conversations, despite the fact that
                    Haig was the Deputy, and was a military man. There may have been a staff meeting
                    or two; but after the first days in the White House in January 1969, where they
                    talked about where we could park and where we could eat in the White House
                    canteen, and so on, there wasn't really group therapy or indoctrination.</p>
                <p>That was partly because there was some real compartmentalization, even within the
                    NSC staff. I mean, the Middle East portfolio was contained pretty tightly,
                    although I got involved some because it involved the Soviets. The Vietnam
                    portfolio was maintained very tightly. It was also politically a very sensitive
                    issue, obviously, both in our domestic politics around the country and between
                    Kissinger and the other senior White House staff people. It was a huge issue in
                    the Nixon administration, combining eventually with Watergate in creating severe
                    difficulties for the Nixon administration.</p>
                <p>I stayed on the NSC staff with Kissinger longer than almost anybody else. One or
                    two others who were there from the beginning then also moved, as I did, to the
                    State Department when Kissinger became Secretary of State. There clearly were
                    things that I wasn't told and didn't know about. I was half-seriously accused of
                    having my own intelligence system to figure out what was going on. In fact, I
                    think Kissinger said something about this in the third volume of his memoirs. It
                    wasn't because I was unusually inquisitive, but because, at the time, the
                    Soviets were still pervasive in their international involvements. Having come
                    from the State Department, where I'd dealt with the analysis of Soviet foreign
                    policy, I became very much involved in regions like Africa, the Middle East,
                    Asia, and of coursLatin America and Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Soviets were every place. You couldn't really give full
                    treatment to Soviet foreign policy without knowing something about what was
                    happening in these other parts of the world and about our relationships there.
                    So I tried to keep my eyes and ears open on the NSC staff, so that if there were
                    a Soviet angle that impinged on our direct relationship with the Soviets, I
                    wouldn't be blindsided. But the NSC staff was not organized in such a way that
                    everybody knew about everything that was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: Well now, how - what was the feeling that you were getting about the
                    Kissinger- Dobrynin connection? I mean, how did you view Dobrynin as - I mean,
                    were you well plugged into what was happening there? Or, I mean, it was a very
                    important relationship.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was sporadically plugged in. Sometimes it involved passing pieces
                    of paper back and forth and looking at Soviet replies or Soviet pieces of paper.
                    When that happened, generally I and my little unit handled it. That was done
                    mostly by Bill Hyland, a CIA Soviet expert who had come to work with me in, I
                    think, April of 1969. He eventually had a very good career of his own. In 1973,
                    after the NSC, he became head of INR in the State Department in the Kissinger
                    period, and then moved back to the NSC in 1975, as Deputy National Security
                    Advisor. In 1984, he became editor of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p>When there was something formal in the Dobrynin channel, documents going back and
                    forth, we usually got a look at them, and we also had some opportunity to make
                    an input into something that Kissinger was going to give or say to Dobrynin, on
                    some issue that was in play in more formal front channels.</p>
                <p>On many of these issues, of course, Kissinger and Nixon did not keep the State
                    Department informed. In the case of China, that was more difficult to do,
                    because a lot of expertise was over in the State Department. There was also
                    Soviet expertise in the State Department, but Nixon relied a lot on his own
                    instinct and experience.</p>
                <p>But anyway, policy-making was more tightly held in the White House, in the NSC
                    staff; and the Dobrynin relationship, likewise. Dobrynin has discussed this at
                    great length in his own memoirs, and Kissinger has also to some extent in his
                    memoirs. Whatever official exchanges were put on paper are now becoming
                    available through the Freedom of Information Act and other ways, but not every
                    word they said to each other. Conversations were not necessarily recorded by
                    either of them. They rarely had an additional person there, although they did on
                    occasion; but this “back channel” was a significant way of communicating with
                    the Kremlin. I think Kissinger and Nixon, Kissinger and Haig were convinced of
                    that. [end of tape]</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>We really couldn't tell what Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko may have known.
                    Eventually he became a Politburo member and got to know more. Then there was
                    Kosygin, the Prime Minister: just what did the Kremlin or Brezhnev share with
                    him in these communications back and forth? But Dobrynin was a key link in this
                    channel on many issues. You have to give him credit that he established himself
                    in such a way that this intensive relationship could be maintained. He was a
                    diplomat, and a shrewd one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Ambassadors many times tended to get circumvented by higher-level
                    face-to-face meetings and nowadays by telephone calls and e-mails. He was
                    clearly a key part of the communications net between the White House and
                    Brezhnev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern on your part or any of your
                        colleagues about Dobrynin, as far as being a good messenger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I wondered sometimes whether he really understood everything that
                    was said to him - precisely as it was said. He was quite good and fluent in
                    English, but I sometimes wondered. But I couldn't pinpoint it. I think that
                    Kissinger or Nixon, obviously, were very much interested in being sure that
                    Dobrynin sent back to Moscow precisely what they intended to convey. Whatever
                    efforts they made at verifying this, it was not easy to do, even with
                    intelligence methods: what he reported, and what he commented on what he had
                    been given, clearly was very important. Subsequently, when it became known that
                    this active “back channel” was operating there, there were State Department
                    people and members of our own SALT negotiating delegation who found themselves
                    circumvented through this channel. They were worried about how solid a channel
                    it was in terms of getting real messages through to the other side. I think
                    papers have been written about the dangers of this informality in the “back
                    channels,” compared to having note-takers, skilled interpreters, and so on, who
                    could make sure that there was no misunderstanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It didn't keep me awake at night, but sometimes I wondered, when I
                    heard Dobrynin talk, just how perfect his comprehension actually was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, look too from the Watergate thing. I mean you
                        were there during that. I mean, from your perspective, how sort of, what was
                        the effect in stabilizing? I mean, what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, as the Watergate investigation blossomed, as it developed and
                    grew, you obviously wondered how much attention the President was able to give
                    to other issues. It turned out that he was quite extraordinary, in fact: that he
                    did remain very active in foreign policy (and Henry Kissinger did as well), and
                    took foreign trips and was directly involved in negotiations. It became an
                    increasingly difficult climate because things seemed to be closing in on the
                    President in late '73 and '74. Of course, I went back as Counselor to the State
                    Department in early '74. There too, you had to be concerned about where this was
                    all going to end and what would happen. We also had the Agnew crisis right at
                    that time-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: - so that there wasn't an obvious successor when Vice President
                    Agnew had to resign. Nixon selected Congressman Gerald Ford, who fortunately had
                    no serious difficulty getting approved in the Congress to be the Vice President.
                    The widespread feeling that the top of the government was gradually getting
                    immobilized, and that things were getting very difficult for the President, was
                    very uncomfortable, especially if you'd worked with him and you were, as I was,
                    not within the innermost circle, but in a circle.</p>
                <p>I personally got dragged into this situation in a peculiar way. In 1973, when
                    Watergate was coming into fuller and fuller bloom, the Secretary of Commerce,
                    Pete Peterson, was let go by the Nixon administration. I had been in Moscow with
                    Peterson in 1972 on a trip to work out trade relations with the Soviets, and I
                    had been the NSC representative with him in several meetings with the Soviets in
                    Washington. When Peterson was dismissed, the responsibility for East-West trade
                    and economic relations with the Soviet Union was transferred from Commerce to
                    George Shultz at the Treasury Department. Secretary Shultz wanted me to come to
                    the Treasury Department, and he proposed to create a special Under Secretaryship
                    for this job of dealing with the Soviet Union, in which he was quite
                    interested.</p>
                <p>In 1973, I went to Moscow with Secretary Shultz on a trip to meet with Kosygin
                    and Brezhnev. The American business community had great expectations about doing
                    business with the Soviets in the petroleum sector, and in various other areas as
                    well. So Shultz wanted me to come to the Treasury as Under Secretary. I figured
                    that after spending four-and-a-half years in the NSC staff, it would be a good
                    move for me - in fact, better in many ways than I might expect as a career guy
                    [civil servant]. I checked it with Kissinger, who wasn't enthusiastic; but he
                    said, “Okay, if that's what you want to do, go ahead.”</p>
                <p>I was then formally nominated by President Nixon to be Under Secretary of the
                    Treasury. When my confirmation hearings were held by the Senate Finance
                    Committee in the spring of 1973, several people came out of the woodwork to
                    accuse me of ancient security charges that I think I described before - charges
                    that I was an Israeli spy and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In the course of these hearings, some of my accusers were asked to
                    testify, and they regurgitated the whole business. Senator Russell Long, the
                    chairman of the Finance Committee-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Louisiana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -which was responsible for this, wanted to see my security file in
                    the State Department. Based on past practice, the State Department said they
                    wouldn't make my file available. They offered to make available a summary;
                    they'd be prepared to send the head of the Security Office up to testify, or to
                    send the Committee a memo to point out that these charges were a fabrication.
                    But the Senate Committee insisted on getting the documents, or getting to look
                    at the documents or letting a designated Senate staff guy go through my security
                    file.</p>
                <p>Well, all this was happening at the same time as discussions of broader issues
                    relating to the provision of documents from the White House that the Watergate
                    investigators in Congress were demanding. The administration people, the White
                    House people who were involved in that Watergate issue, were fighting the
                    release of documents (eventually, you know, the courts got involved). They
                    didn't want to create some new precedent for making documents available to
                    Congress, and therefore, they would not let my file go to the Senate Finance
                    Committee. I told Senator Long, “You can look at anything you want, as far as
                    I'm concerned, but it's above me! It's a big policy issue! I can't decide what
                    to do about this!”</p>
                <p>So my nomination hung in the Committee for seven months because of this problem,
                    that they couldn't get the Sonnenfeldt security file! I don't mean to exaggerate
                    this, but it was unusual. Nowadays, nominees get held up forever, but seven
                    months was almost a record at that time. Even The New York Times published an
                    editorial calling for action on my nomination! Eventually, a deal was made with
                    Senator Long: he would get my nomination voted out in his Committee; it would
                    then be withdrawn, and I would be nominated as Counselor of the State
                    Department. That's what happened. The Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing
                    and approved my nomination as Counselor, and I was then confirmed by the Senate.
                    But that whole process took a long time, and it was certainly influenced by the
                    overall Watergate controversy in the manner which I've described.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>But in any case, during the Yom Kippur War, when the U.S. went on a modest
                    military alert in October of '73, questions were raised about whether Nixon
                    really had been involved in this decision, or whether Nixon wanted to create an
                    international crisis in order to save himself from his troubles with Watergate.
                    Henry Kissinger got beat up on in a press conference the morning after it leaked
                    that some of our forces had gone on an increased alert. He became very angry
                    about that charge, asking what was happening to this country and to this
                    capital, when people who have profound responsibilities for the national
                    interest get charged with playing crude politics.</p>
                <p>So this kind of thing, questions about how complicit Nixon was, dragged on and on
                    through 1974. We had a gasoline crisis, an energy crisis because of the Arab
                    boycotts, so there was a confluence of problems, plus the fact that the Vietnam
                    War was coming to an ugly end for us. Everyone said, “there isn't really a
                    foreign policy problem,” and in a sort of practical sense, there wasn't.
                    Everything was functioning; we had meetings with other countries, and so on. In
                    June of '74, a few weeks before he resigned, Nixon went to Moscow for a summit
                    meeting. We actually negotiated the essence of an additional test ban treaty,
                    the underground nuclear test ban treaty, at that meeting.</p>
                <p>Brezhnev kept saying that he just couldn't understand how anyone could do this to
                    their leader, who has been such a successful president and achieved better
                    relations with the Soviet Union. “But we don't understand what the American
                    political system is doing here,” he would say. Of course, it was awkward for our
                    allies, who were watching this and wondering. We had a NATO summit a little
                    earlier in '74, in which Nixon participated, and they were wondering how long
                    they would still be dealing with him. They didn't know Gerald Ford particularly
                    well. Everybody realized he would become the president if something should
                    happen, if Nixon was to be impeached. It was unclear; certainly foreigners had
                    difficulty tracking all of this.</p>
                <p>So we got some vibes about this at the upper reaches of the foreign policy
                    establishment in the government. People tried to pump us: how we thought it was
                    going to come out; what was going to happen? Would we be handicapped in meeting
                    our commitments? What if somebody attacked? What if the Soviets attacked? And
                    NATO, and so on? What could we say, other than to say, “commitments are
                    commitments!” It began to become awkward. However, it has to be said that in the
                    end, there wasn't any serious damage to American interests during this whole
                    tragedy, even as it got closer and closer to its final outcome. I mean, our
                    withdrawal froVietnam was going to happen, one way or another; we were going to
                    get out.</p>
                <p>However, the aftermath of Vietnam turned out to be not nearly as apocalyptic as
                    many of us thought it might be - namely, that the word would spread around the
                    whole region that the Americans were a paper tiger, or a giant with clay feet,
                    as Nixon said at one point. There was a problem in Cambodia that Ford had to
                    deal with early on. But the region itself didn't collapse into Communism - no
                    falling dominos!</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>On the contrary, the Indonesians had slaughtered their Communists and complicated
                    the Chinese relationship with Indonesia for a while. Our own relationship with
                    China continued to blossom. They were more interested in the weight of the
                    country than the individual president. The historians will have different views
                    of just what all of this Watergate controversy did to American interests. My own
                    judgment, to this day, is that - while it was a very difficult and uncomfortable
                    time, especially if you'd worked as closely as we all did work with President
                    Nixon in the White House setting and on the various trips with foreign visitors
                    and foreign policy decisions - it was very difficult and sad, because he was
                    very gifted in the fields that we had to deal with. Nixon was skillful and
                    knowledgeable, with good foreign policy instincts. But the number one
                    implication of Watergate in foreign policy terms, security terms, I think is
                    very difficult to measure as a negative. Of course, when you go fast-forward
                    sixteen years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe those are the ones for their side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't know whether all our troubles extended the life of the
                    Soviet Union, or not. That gets to be very speculative stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to sum up. You didn't feel particularly that gee,
                        we've got to, considering all this Watergate stuff, let's not put this
                        forward, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well - no. In the Yom Kippur War, there was what in the Clinton
                    administration came to be known as the “wag-the-dog syndrome.” You know, it's
                    this movie about a president staging a military conflict to save himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think in the Clinton administration's handling of the Kosovo
                    crisis, there was some concern about people saying,”this is all a wag-the-dog
                    thing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We didn't want to go to war in the Yom Kippur War. We got some
                    intelligence and a rather threatening message from Brezhnev in late October of
                    1973, so we felt that we needed to do something with our military forces, just
                    to make sure the Soviets understood that, if they had any thought of
                    intervention in the Middle East, whatever our domestic problems were, we were
                    still able to pursue our foreign policy interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So basically this is a response rather than an
                        initiative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, and it was a modest response. If there were initiatives that
                    might have been taken if Nixon had been in full power, and the whole situation
                    hadn't become as difficult and as preoccupying as it did, I really can't think
                    of one.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the coin, as I was mentioning, in mid-1974 in his last
                    summit meeting with Brezhnev, President Nixon didn't hesitate to make the
                    agreement barring underground nuclear tests. It wasn't a big-deal agreement, but
                    it was not a trivial agreement either. It still needed some work afterwards,
                    which was done; and it was eventually ratified by the Senate. Some people said,
                    “Well, Nixon's just trying to show how indispensable he is to maintain relations
                    with the Soviets; and then he went on this trip to the Middle East, where he was
                    cheered by millions; and he went to Vienna, when he was near the end of his
                    tenure; and he probably did that because of the impeachment proceedings.” People
                    were saying that his activities were staged somehow, to show how indispensable
                    he was, but it didn't stop the process of policy-making here. He probably had
                    other considerations, in addition to his own fate, in undertaking those foreign
                    policy initiatives toward the end of his tenure; but we weren't going to
                    pressure anybody or go to war with anybody, anyway!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't think there was anything of significance, one way or the
                    other - positive or negative, defensive or offensive - that we decided we
                    shouldn't do because it would look like it was Watergate-related. But there
                    isn't any question that, because of the preoccupations with Watergate, there
                    might have been something of significance that we might have done - I can't
                    think of what it was - that perhaps was shelved until things were clearer
                    here.</p>
                <p>That may also have affected what some other governments were doing. I think these
                    “what-ifs” are very difficult to pinpoint, at least for me. We are talking about
                    nearly 30 years ago. It's hard to identify a case that was either clearly one of
                    not doing something because of concern about Watergate, or a matter of doing
                    something because of Watergate, in order to parry the domestic attack on the
                    President and show how important he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to sense on the part of Kissinger and Haig,
                        their getting more involved with the White House? I mean, you know, the
                        domestic-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, Haig had left the NSC to be Vice Chief of Staff of the Army,
                    and then he came back to the White House as Nixon's chief of staff, so he was
                    deeply involved with Nixon! As for Kissinger, I can't really testify to his
                    particular involvement, but he still was National Security Advisor, in fact, as
                    well as Secretary of State. General Brent Scowcroft was Kissinger's Deputy; Haig
                    was the chief of staff, so the three of them were very much around the President
                    as the clock ticked.</p>
                <p>This is something that Kissinger and Haig really would have to answer. Both of
                    them have written extensively about it and given interviews on just how all of
                    this affected their day-to-day relations and contacts with the President.</p>
                <p>But Kissinger was often at the White House. There were meetings of the
                    interagency committees and other sessions. There were crises: the Yom Kippur War
                    in October of '73; the energy crisis that spilled over into '74; and there was
                    the end-game in Vietnam, which was difficult. So there were plenty of things
                    going on that required attention. I think the set-up wasn't exactly normal, but
                    I think it functioned. In fact, after the change in Vietnam's economic reform
                    program, there was some discussion, in which I participated, about the fact
                    that, despite all the Watergate and impeachment problems, the foreign policy
                    system and the security system functioned.</p>
                <p>Now there is another track on this, which is attributed to then-Secretary of
                    Defense Jim Schlesinger. It is said that he gave orders to the military not to
                    accept any direct White House orders to do one thing or another unless the order
                    came through him. There have been some stories floating around during the last
                    year or two about anxieties in some quarters that Nixon would do something rash
                    to protect himself, involving the military. I don't think that's ever been
                    documented, although it has been written about by journalists. I personally
                    don't know anything about that, and I don't know anything about orders from the
                    White House. In my position, I wouldn't have gotten the order to mobilize the
                    forces anyway.</p>
                <p>But I can't think of any instruction or guidance or suggestion to do things in
                    the foreign policy realm that looked like they were phony, or were done for this
                    extraneous reason of protecting Nixon, or ginning up crises that could have been
                    avoided.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, we'll pick this up the next time at 1974, and
                        you were named the what? Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Counselor?Yes, okay. Good.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>Q: Okay, today is August 7, 2001. Hal, in 1974 you became Counselor of the State
                    Department. What, in your case, did the title, “Counselor of the Department of
                    State” mean? I interviewed, oh, 15 years ago Douglas MacArthur, and he had that
                    title under Dulles and Eisenhower, but he was sort of an inter, you know, with a
                    few other people-</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I think he also went to a lot of official funerals, because the name
                    “MacArthur-”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -it made a difference. I don't mean to downgrade his substantive
                    involvement. Basically, my role as Counselor was much the same as my role on the
                    NSC staff in terms of the responsibilities and issues which I covered, which
                    included East-West relations; relations with the Europeans; NATO; some aspects,
                    particularly the more political aspects of arms control; non-proliferation; and
                    so on. We had an understanding and divided up the seventh floor (policy-making)
                    responsibilities between the Counselor's office and the Under Secretary of State
                    for Policy, Joe Sisco. Maybe Phil Habib was still Under Secretary for Policy for
                    a while - I can't remember exactly. But anyway, the Under Secretary is really
                    the number-three job in the Department. At that time, I think it was already
                    called Under Secretary, but for a long time before, it had been called Deputy
                    Under Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: We had just one Under Secretary for Policy, and other people on the
                    seventh floor were still called Deputies. Essentially Joe Sisco, who had that
                    job, covered all the rest of the world, and of course he wasn't precluded from
                    getting involved in the things that I concentrated on. But it worked out that he
                    was plenty busy with the Middle East and various other issues. So I essentially
                    took my brief from the NSC over to the State Department. Of course, for a while
                    Kissinger was both Secretary of State and National Security Advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But even so, the people I left behind who had worked with me in the
                    NSC staff did have some different responsibilities from the ones that we had in
                    the State Department, because they were still, in part, presidential staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And you had?you were closer, sort of, to the
                        operational side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. I worked more closely with EUR (Bureau of European Affairs) and
                    the Politico-Military Bureau, and ACDA (Arms Control and Disarmament Agency),
                    and the interagency process, as far as relations with the Soviets, NATO issues,
                    and some of the crises that we contended with, such as the energy crisis. I
                    wasn't an energy expert; but the energy problems involved relations very
                    prominently with the Europeans in early '74, after the Yom Kippur War. I did
                    much the same kind of work that I had done in the NSC staff, for example, in
                    preparations for Nixon's summit meetings with Brezhnev.</p>
                <p>Nixon and Brezhnev alternated as hosts of annual summit meetings, starting in
                    1972 in Moscow. Brezhnev had been in the U.S. in 1973, and then Nixon, even
                    though his clock was ticking [impeachment proceedings], went ahead in June of
                    1974 for what turned out to be his final visit to Moscow as President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Watergate business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. Despite Watergate, Nixon went ahead in June to go to Moscow. I
                    staffed that summit visit with my own tiny staff in the Counselor's office, in
                    conjunction with the Bureaus in the State Department and the NSC staff, of
                    course, under Kissinger's guidance. My responsibilities in substance were
                    essentially quite similar to what I'd done in the NSC staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself?we'll get down to some detail,
                        but did you find yourself?it seems like in a way you were almost running in
                        competition with the EUR Bureau; or maybe competition's the wrong word, but
                        doing the same, some of the same thing because you're no longer in the
                        advisory thing; you're over in the action.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, the situation was delicate. By then, Arthur Hartman had become
                    the Assistant Secretary in EUR. (He had even more experience afterwards when he
                    served as U.S. Ambassador in Paris and Moscow.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He felt that EUR should have its traditional responsibilities, but
                    we managed to work out a modus vivendi to manage the State Department business
                    of drafting telegrams, and by what route the telegram gets to the Secretary of
                    State for approval it if was sufficiently important to require his attention. If
                    I hadn't been there as Counselor, it might have gone through the Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs, who probably would have just let the European Bureau
                    write it, and then initial it and send it on. Anything to do with the Soviet
                    Union was an EUR function, and we no longer had a Special Advisor to the
                    Secretary of State for Soviet Affairs, like Tommy Thompson had been in an
                    earlier period. I sort of was that, but Kissinger was sort of his own special
                    advisor on Soviet issues. But that was certainly one of my responsibilities, to
                    concentrate on Soviet affairs. So I think we worked it all right. I don't know
                    whether you've interviewed Arthur Hartman-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -and how he saw it. I know it was sensitive. I know that Kissinger's
                    style, of sometimes circumventing some people who ought to be in the line of
                    action, came into play. On occasion he'd try to manipulate the situation. But I
                    think Art and I worked it pretty well together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have - I mean talking about that, did you
                        and Arthur Hartman at some times almost work off to the side and keep each
                        other informed when maybe Kissinger was not - you know, sort of going his
                        own way, maybe not for any reason except this was his style.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I think Art had his own eyes and ears. He'd been in the
                    Foreign Service for a long time, so he knew pretty much anybody that was of
                    consequence around the building, including in the front office [Secretary of
                    State's office]; and I had my contacts. We talked, and we tried to keep up with
                    what Henry was doing. There was this myth around the State Department that I had
                    a very, very special relationship with Kissinger, and that I sneaked in by the
                    back door to operate behind the backs of the Bureaus, which wasn't really so. I
                    did have a special relationship with Kissinger, but not really for the purpose
                    of circumventing anybody. We talked from time to time about how things were
                    going, and especially during the tough Watergate time. American interests didn't
                    cease because the president was encumbered by dealing with a serious problem. So
                    Kissinger and I had that sort of relationship.</p>
                <p>And I tried not to get involved in complicated maneuvers of doing things behind
                    the backs of people who would find out about it anyway. But there were “back
                    channels,” and I knew some of what was going on, but not all of it. There was
                    the relationship between Kissinger and the Soviet Ambassador, Dobrynin. Some of
                    it seeped out in one way or another, and some of it came to me maybe in chats
                    with Kissinger; some of it got to Hartman through the grapevine. So let's say it
                    was a little unstructured way of doing things.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, with Dobrynin, were you able to sit down and talk
                        with him, or was he pretty well reserved for-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He was pretty well reserved for Kissinger and Scowcroft, who was
                    Kissinger's Deputy National Security Advisor until he succeeded Kissinger as the
                    full National Security Advisor. I dealt more with Dobrynin'Deputy Chiefs of
                    Mission (DCMs). For example, in preparation for the summit meetings, as you
                    know, you always pre-cook the statements that would be issued in the final
                    communiqu�. In the cases of the three summit meetings o'72, '73 and '74, I
                    worked with whomever the DCM was. One actually was Yuli Vorontsov, who much
                    later became the Russian Ambassador here. We fiddled around with the language
                    for the communiqu� and whatever else was being cooked up. The leaders always
                    wanted to issue public statements at signing ceremonies for whatever agreements
                    they reached. You know, we had 11 or 12 signing ceremonies in front of
                    television cameras at the 1972 summit in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the detente period, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, it's called the detente period. We had problems with the
                    Soviets, but it was part of the challenge in lots of meetings and “back
                    channels.” The plan for the '74 summit, when I was Counselor, was to issue a
                    Ford-Brezhnev communiqu�, but the centerpiece of that summit meeting was going
                    to be a draft treaty on underground nuclear testing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The technicalities of it were being negotiated in Moscow by an
                    American team that knew something about the technical issues, and a Soviet team.
                    So we just had to prepare some references to it in the communiqu� and the final
                    statement, and there were other issues we covered that I've forgotten now. On
                    this sort of thing, I dealt with the Minister at the Soviet Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and maybe the Minister at the Soviet Embassy feel
                        a little bit frustrated that your principals were carrying on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I had a feeling that Dobrynin may have been more forthcoming with
                    his immediate subordinate than Kissinger was with his. I can't tell for sure.
                    Dobrynin had made clear that he could communicate directly with Brezhnev and the
                    Kremlin. In fact, one of the hopes was that he would circumvent Gromyko [the
                    long-time Soviet Foreign Minister], because Gromyko, although he was respected
                    as a professional, was also a naysayer and a very hard-to-move sort of a guy;
                    and ultimately, he didn't have much authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He did become a member of the Politburo, but still didn't become the
                    president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't become the president or something like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He got all those titles, but you know it wasn't real power. He
                    clearly had influence because of his long memory and his long involvement.
                    Dobrynin made it sound as though he'd communicated directly with Brezhnev, and
                    then if the Kremlin decided to inform the Foreign Minister, that was their
                    business. But I think Dobrynin cut in his Minister, at least to some extent,
                    possibly just to protect his backside against the KGB (Komitet gosudarstvennoi
                    bezopasnosti-Soviet Committee of State Security) people who were operating in
                    the embassy. Whether that Minister had access to the message that Dobrynin would
                    send to the Kremlin, or whether it played back via Foreign Ministry channels to
                    their embassy, I don't know for sure. So I wasn't really frustrated about
                    Kissinger's separate conversations with Dobrynin, as long as he kept me
                    generally informed so that I wouldn't be going off on some tangent, and that
                    really worked pretty well. We did have some people around the State Department
                    who conducted their own policy, sometimes because of ignorance because they
                    didn't know what was really going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get a?you know, I'm trying to catch the
                        atmospherics. I mean, here you'd been working and kind of used to working
                        with Henry Kissinger and his style of operation; but what about some of the
                        others - the staff assistants and other advisors and around this? I mean did
                        you get any feeling that there was, I mean, sort of a court atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, I'd say that idea was exaggerated. I think that Kissinger's
                    immediate staff - Jerry Bremer, Larry Eagleburger for a while before he became
                    Deputy Under Secretary for Management - they played it close to the vest,
                    because they knew that Kissinger was very sensitive about some of his
                    operations. But they also sent warning signals if something we were doing at the
                    next level down wasn't in consonance with what Kissinger had been thinking or
                    doing, to the extent that they knew. I'm not sure that they necessarily knew
                    everything either.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>Now I think this business of the “court,” in the sense I've just described, you
                    could say it's something I would doubt. But there's a very interesting thing
                    that was not understood at the time, and to some extent isn't understood yet by
                    people who write about this. Kissinger had a voracious appetite for virtually
                    all elements of U.S. foreign policy: Latin America; Africa at some point; Asia;
                    the Middle East very much; Europe; the Soviet Union; and so on; plus some of the
                    functional issues like energy. He was less interested in economics. During his
                    Secretary of Stateship, I think he delivered something like two dozen major
                    speeches around the country. He did feel that it was important for the country
                    to be aware of the major issues and our approach to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kissinger has written in his most recent book about the need for
                    public support for policy. I don't know how much he really felt that that was
                    all that necessary. But in any case, he made a couple of dozen speeches; they
                    were all on a particular topic or group of topics. In preparation for that, he
                    didn't just use the speechwriters in the Policy Planning staff, which had become
                    the speech-writing shop. (Winston Lord, another close associate of Henry's, was
                    the head of that staff.). But he did draw on people whom he respected around the
                    building, those he thought had good judgment and experience; and they got in on
                    the speech-drafting, in actual meetings with the Secretary. If he found somebody
                    who had particular insight, he didn't hesitate to deal with that person,
                    regardless of his or her rank. I once made up a count toward the end of our
                    tenure there, and actually found that there must have been about 200 people in
                    the Department who had had direct contact with the Secretary during the nearly
                    three-and-a-half years that Kissinger was Secretary of State (September 1973 to
                    January 1977). By “contact-”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: - I mean they participated in a meeting, and actually had a chance
                    to say something-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Say something, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -Or they had a chance to make a contribution to speeches, or to help
                    out on one of the many trips that Kissinger took to different parts of the
                    world. So my feeling was actually that in some ways, Kissinger had more contact
                    with regular State Department staff than some other Secretaries of State
                    did.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, because looking at the histories of other Secretaries of State, they
                    often were surrounded by the coteries-</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, it was layered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And didn't reach out as much - very interesting. So tell
                        me, what was your impression of our relationship during this time with the
                        Soviet Union? Did this seem like a good developing one, or was it one to be
                        treated with caution, or was it more in PR (public relations) than really in
                        substance? Or how did you feel that? I'm talking about what is called
                        “detente” or such.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, we resisted the term “detente,” you know, because it got
                    confused with “entente.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I remember early on when this word kept being used in the press, I
                    actually looked up the origins of the term. It comes from archery, but the
                    diplomatic definition was “a temporary interlude of lessened tensions in a
                    generally hostile situation.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, which isn't a very -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Now, that actually was the fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But since “detente” was confused with “entente,” it sounded more
                    like a condition that actually existed, one of relaxed tensions, which was
                    indefinite and permanent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Yes, I know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In retrospect, I think the Soviets in the '70s began to recognize
                    that they had serious problems in their economy, that their military had the
                    overwhelming call on resources, costly resources, very much at the expense of
                    the civilian sector. I think the Soviet leadership - and perhaps some of the
                    younger ones that came to the fore later on in the '80s and when Gorbachev got
                    there - began to realize that the Soviet Union was falling further and further
                    behind the industrialized West. [end of tape]</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>There even came to be signs, which were noted, that some of the developing
                    countries in what was called the “Third World” were beginning to get into a more
                    advanced industrial and technological phase in their development, which in the
                    case of the Soviet Union was not very much in evidence, except for the military
                    and the space program. So that was one thing. Brezhnev was eager to get Western
                    investment. There were people in the West who were interested in investment,
                    especially in petroleum, gas, and other areas, as Brezhnev told Peter Peterson
                    and me, when Peterson was the Commerce Secretary. As I mentioned previously,
                    after the 1972 Nixon-Brezhnev summit, I accompanied Peterson to Moscow on a
                    delegation he led to modestly normalize trade relations. Brezhnev talked about
                    getting billions and billions of dollars of investment from the West and from
                    the U.S. to help build up Siberia, and so on. So I think that was one aspect of
                    “detente.” And I think we thought we had some leverage, and Kissinger thought
                    that we had some leverage, vis-�-vis the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The second factor is that Eastern Europe was uneasy, in countries long dominated
                    by the Russians. There were problems with Poland in the '70s, and simmering
                    problems in other parts of Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>Then there was our new relationship with China. The Soviet relationship with
                    China was very shaky, to put it mildly. And there were various other factors
                    affecting our relationships, among them the arteriosclerotic condition of the
                    Soviet leadership, including Brezhnev himself.</p>
                <p>So I felt that there was some business to be done with the Soviets to quiet them
                    down, and to limit what I used to call their “imperial drive.” I didn't think
                    there was any grand deal to be made with them, because a grand deal would have
                    meant carving up the world, which wasn't our way of looking at it (although that
                    was sometimes attributed to Kissinger). So I think, as was demonstrated during
                    that time, that there was opportunity to do some beneficial business with the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>But we had a problem. We had a constitutional crisis. I'm talking about Watergate
                    in combination with Vietnam. We didn't know how the Soviets were going to read
                    that, and how the rest of the world was going to read that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: For a while, we had hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in
                    the streets against Nixon's actions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Our society was looking like it was falling apart. The civil rights
                    movement, which Nixon was not hostile to in terms of its objectives - there were
                    some problems about the marches, which had a distinctly anti-administration
                    quality. The U.S. looked like it was in its time of troubles-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -of serious troubles. You know, we couldn't tell where it was all
                    headed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we had the energy crisis too!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And we had the energy crisis on top of it. The economy had problems;
                    there was a mounting inflation rate. There would be more inflation later on.</p>
                <p>So there were some real questions about how strong we really were in our own
                    right, even though fundamentally we were stronger than the Soviets. I think, in
                    a way, you had two wounded countries. I think they, as it turned out, were
                    terminally wounded; we were only temporarily wounded before a new burst of
                    effort and activity and growth. This to some extent, I think, brought us
                    together to do some things that ultimately were mostly on the margins, but
                    still-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still, I mean it helped set a certain stage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were there forces, people really, within our
                        administration, who were saying, “Let's start messing around with Eastern
                        Europe or with the various nationality problems in the Soviet Union?” You
                        know, I mean let's keep </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't think those kinds of initiatives went very high into the
                    administration, but there certainly were people around who argued for more
                    aggressive actions. CIA had its operations, and some of those were ended by the
                    Church hearings [Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings chaired by
                    Democratic Senator Frank Church of Idaho]. The CIA financed some groups, not so
                    much to penetrate into the Soviet Union and organize opposition, but to
                    encourage it by broadcasts, and encouraging “samizdat” (self-published papers of
                    people questioning or challenging the Soviet Communist regime).</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, so there were things of this kind going on. Regarding Eastern
                    Europe: Nixon conducted a rather active policy toward Eastern Europe. He was
                    criticized. Of course, later on in the Ford administration, the Helsinki Final
                    Act was signed in 1975. It was severely criticized by people who had been in the
                    administration, or even some that were not in it, as giving away much too much
                    to the Sovietgiving away concrete matters like guaranteeing frontiers in
                    exchange for unenforceable promises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Drawing the line and curving up the lines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. But Nixon had visited Romania. He didn't necessarily like
                    President Ceausescu, but Romania was the big dissident in the Soviet bloc. While
                    he didn't want to encourage any open warfare between Romania and the Soviet
                    Union, Nixon certainly wanted to encourage the individualism of Romania. He went
                    to Poland; President Ford also went to Poland, where everybody knew that beneath
                    the surface, there was quite a bit of resistance bubbling, not just against the
                    Polish Communist regime itself, but against the Soviets. Nixon visited
                    Yugoslavia, which had already split with the USSR; but it needed strengthening,
                    both regionally and within Yugoslavia. So he had an active East European policy,
                    which despite the awkward appearances of ceremonies with Communist rulers, was
                    really treading on the Soviet turf.</p>
                <p>I was personally very much involved in all of this. We wanted to make clear that
                    better U.S. relations with the Soviets in some fields were not at the expense of
                    the East Europeans. Then I got caught in a controversy over the so-called
                    “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine,” that started up in 1976, roughly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There was a leaked reporting telegram written by a Foreign Service
                    Officer (later Ambassador), Warren Zimmermann, who was then in EUR (the European
                    Bureau). It described a seminar that I had led on short notice at a Chiefs of
                    Mission meeting in London in December of 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this one of these European Chiefs of Mission
                        [meetings]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. This one was during the Ford administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Hartman felt that there
                    ought to be a session on Eastern Europe, which hadn't been on the original
                    schedule, and Kissinger had something else to do during the only free period on
                    the program. So Hartman asked me if I could lead a discussion. I said I could,
                    but to check it with Henry to make sure it's all right with him, which was done.
                    (Kissinger has this slightly wrong in the third volume of his memoirs.)</p>
                <p>But in any event, we had this discussion, which I led off extemporaneously. I
                    made some points about Eastern Europe being a very dangerous place because -
                    while the Soviets were indeed in charge - underneath, there were all sorts of
                    elements that might at some point get quite explosive, and might produce a very
                    vigorous Soviet intervention, which could perhaps even spill over into a wider
                    conflict. So I considered the situation in Eastern Europe quite dangerous, and I
                    said so in my comments. I said that, hopefully, someday there would be a Soviet
                    leadership that would recognize that they needed to give the East Europeans more
                    leeway and have a more natural relationship with them. I made the mistake of
                    using the word “organic” in that particular talk because I meant it as
                    synonymous with “natural” - which is, in fact, a dictionary meaning of
                    “organic;” the other meaning being “part of a whole.”</p>
                <p>Well, Warren Zimmermann (sadly, he is now dead) wrote a very elegant but very
                    synoptic, condensed telegram weeks after this meeting, just to send it to the
                    ambassadors for their records and to have something in the record of the State
                    Department about this Chiefs of Mission meeting. His report summarized not only
                    my discussion but several others, including one at another seminar in which
                    Kissinger really blew his stack about domestic problems in the U.S. and how they
                    undermined the country's foreign policies. Well, that one telegram included this
                    word “organic.” Then it was leaked by somebody in the Pentagon, by one of
                    Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's people. Rumsfeld had his quarrels with Kissinger
                    then. Now they're good friends, genuinely good friends. The leak was picked up
                    by the syndicated columnists Evans and Novak, who doctored the text and printed
                    some excerpts in a column published in April 1976. They claimed that I said that
                    there was the danger of World War III in Europe because of Soviet dominance of
                    Eastern Europe, and that what really ought to happen was for Eastern Europe to
                    become an organic part of the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: That column came out on a Monday morning in April of '76, just as
                    the Republican primary campaign was underway between Ronald Reagan and Jerry
                    Ford. It was also the day on which Newsweek started serializing The Final Days,
                    the book-</p>
                <p>Q: The book by Woodward?</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, about the last days of the
                    Nixon administration, which had Nixon and Kissinger kneeling on a carpet and
                    praying together. This particular column by Evans and Novak, with a catchy
                    headline and the idea that the East Europeans should be dominated by Russia,
                    caught the attention of a lot of the East European-oriented groups in the U.S.,
                    and also of some people in the Senate. They immediately raised hell and
                    contacted Kissinger, saying, “This was a shocking statement by your close
                    confidant, Sonnenfeldt!” Bob Funseth, who was then the State Department's
                    Spokesman (he happened to be a close friend of mine in graduate school), went to
                    Kissinger that morning and said, “Sonnenfeldt really ought to get out in front
                    of the press, because that clearly isn't what he said. He should correct this
                    immediately, because it's going to create a firestorm.”</p>
                <p>Kissinger was preoccupied with all kinds of details in The Final Days, and he
                    said, “no, Sonnenfeldt's had enough publicity for one day already.” So I didn't
                    meet with the press and had no chance to clarify Evans' and Novak's
                    misrepresentation of my position - which in fact was 180 degrees away from what
                    they wrote!</p>
                <p>This controversy began to bubble along; and it wasn't until several weeks later
                    that I finally got to testify in Congress to correct what had been rendered in
                    the Evans and Novak column. A few newspaper editorialists - including Cy
                    Sulzberger in the New York Times, who had written a very nasty op-ed column
                    about this, and the Washington Post - when they actually read the Zimmermann
                    telegram, which was not a verbatim report but a synopsis, eventually wrote
                    columns correcting their original analyses.</p>
                <p>But the so-called “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine” became an issue in the Reagan-Ford
                    Republican primary campaign, and later an issue in the Carter-Ford presidential
                    campaign. It became an issue in the second televised debate between Ford and
                    Carter, when a reporter raised the question of whether the Soviets were in
                    control of Poland. Ford responded quickly, saying, “No! No! No! They don't
                    control Poland!” - which in a sense was correct, but made it appear as though
                    Ford didn't understand what the Soviets were doing in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>Kissinger's only comment at the time, or during that period was, “If there was
                    going to be any doctrine in my administration, it wasn't going to be called the
                    “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine!”</p>

                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Anyway, he did sort of stand up for me. But the “Sonnenfeldt
                    Doctrine” is still rattling around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I'm sorry about this distraction!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no! It was very </hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Going back to your question about the condition of the Soviet Union:
                    there were things going on in Eastern Europe; and the Soviets, while we were
                    still in office in the '70s, had serious problems in keeping discipline in
                    Poland. The situation in Romania they didn't like; but as they saw it, Romania
                    at least was a dictatorship which had control of its own people; the Romanians
                    were just running their own show. But Hungary and Poland were bubbling.
                    Czechoslovakia after 1968 was kept in line; East Germany remained under control;
                    Bulgaria was off to one side. But Poland and Hungary showed signs of
                    restlessness! Then, after the Helsinki Final Act was adopted in 1975, there was
                    more restlessness inside the Soviet Union. So I think there was a combination of
                    issues, which did represent some opportunity for us to make some progress in
                    relations with the Soviets, in order to reduce somewhat the severity of the
                    confrontation. There were periods of great tension that were yet to follow: the
                    Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; and there were some nuclear alert situations in
                    the beginning of the Reagan administration in the '80s.</p>
                <p>I think there were serious systemic weaknesses showing up in the Soviet system,
                    more than we actually recognized, although I think we had a sense of it, at
                    least I think I did. If handled with care - not provocatively, which might
                    provoke the Soviets to do something drastic, which we'd all regret - these
                    strains could lead not so much to a loving, friendly relationship, but to an
                    ebbing of the tide of Soviet power. This is hindsight now; at the time, we got
                    some signs of it. (Reagan, later in the '80s said it.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this represents something interesting, because I've
                        talked to people who have said that one of the concerns with Henry Kissinger
                        was they felt he was so much of a, almost a Europeanist in coming out of the
                        European background, that he didn't see the United States as being able to
                        sort of hang on, and that he was trying to cut his losses. The time was
                        almost-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was Spenglerian.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the time was really on the side of the Soviets. Did
                        you have any; did you get any of that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I had some of those feelings earlier - when they beat us into space
                    with Sputnik in 1958, and when they seemed to be getting stronger militarily;
                    and their role in the world seemed to expand. They had a global navy which
                    exercised and showed the flag; they were active in Southern Africa; they were
                    active in East Africa; they had Cuba; they tried to get entr�e into Latin
                    America, even though they had their very severe problem with China. Somewhere in
                    the records is a paper which I wrote sometime in the '70s, which made the point
                    that I thought the Soviets had serious problems, systemic problems, but that
                    that didn't mean that they couldn't lash out and be dangerous; and that we had
                    our own troubles at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In fact, I said there was sort of a law of simultaneous
                    troubles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It really took a while for us to regain our confidence. Carter
                    talked about U.S. “malaise.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was not until some time into the Reagan administration that this
                    mood of uneasiness in our own country dissipated.</p>
                <p>But on the Soviet side, the leaders were these old guys who, one after another,
                    died. It wasn't until Gorbachev came along that there seemed to be some chance
                    for renewal, and even then, you couldn't tell exactly. Kissinger, I think, was
                    widely assumed to be a sort of historical pessimist. There were people who
                    called him a Spenglerian; and I think some people thought this of Nixon as well.
                    As you know, Nixon in 1971 had made his statement about a five-cornered world in
                    which he envisioned the U.S. as one of five major powers - the United States,
                    Russia or thSoviet Union, Europe, Japan, and China - with each of the powers
                    balancing each other. He thought that this was really the best way that you
                    could expect to have some sort of peace. People said, “Ah, this is the old
                    balance of power, which always has led to war in the past; and then you get
                    three against two, or whatever divisions; and this is not really the American
                    way.” There was a latent hegemonism or isolationism in the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>Even before Kissinger ever became famous, there was an article by Paul Nitze in
                    Reporter Magazine, reviewing a book of Henry's. I can't recall which book it
                    was, but it was known that Henry had written a doctoral dissertation about
                    Metternich at the Congress of Vienna; that he seemed to be a great admirer of
                    the Austrian Chancellor, Prince Metternich, and of German Chancellor Bismarck;
                    that he admired these old-style power-balancers in nineteenth-century Europe;
                    and that he seemed to have some questions about the real strength of the United
                    States. Incidentally, I think the speeches that Kissinger gave as Secretary of
                    State, which I mentioned earlier, were to some extent intended to counter this
                    image of him as a historical pessimist, and to show that the United States was
                    vibrant and vigorous, but also had interests that it needed to pursue, and that
                    its government needed public understanding of those interests.</p>
                <p>I think Admiral Elmo Zumwalt was one of the people who wrote about this later.
                    But when he was still the Chief of Naval Operations in the early or mid-1970s,
                    the story was told that on the train on the way back from an Army-Navy game in
                    Philadelphia, maybe in 1973, Zumwalt was talking to various people, and that he
                    was making comments about Henry's fatalism and pessimis(I don't know whether
                    Navy had lost; it must have lost, so he then may have been in a bad mood).</p>
                <p>So there was that idea, and there was the fact that Henry was European-born and
                    was more interested in Europe (however, you know, he got very deeply involved in
                    the Middle East).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He was involved in Vietnam; eventually he got involved in China,
                    rather romantically involved with China; he got interested in Africa, partly
                    because of problems in Angola, with the Cubans and the Soviets there in Angola;
                    and he was interested in Latin America, even while he focused on Europe.
                    Incidentally, Kissinger was quite suspicious - despite what Nixon had said about
                    Europe as an eventual great power - he was suspicious about European unity, West
                    European unity. He'd written in the '60s that as far as he could tell, given the
                    history of Europe, the only organizing principle of a united Europe would be
                    opposition to the United States. And I think some of that idea is still
                    occasionally echoed in what he says.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sorry! [Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So, whereas the State Department was very strongly in favor of
                    European unity, there was an instance when the president or chairman of the
                    European Commission had come to Washington on a visit and had had the
                    expectation of meeting with President Nixon. Bob Schaetzel was then our
                    Ambassador to what was still the EEC (European Economic Community). They showed
                    up at the White House, and there was nothing on President Nixon's schedule.
                    Schaetzel blew up in smoke and never forgave Henry for it, or Nixon for
                    humiliating a very prominent European, to show that the White House just wasn't
                    with it. The State Department had been very strongly involved in the
                    arrangements for this visi(The incident was a mix-up in the schedulnot
                    intentional.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I am, I say, maybe, because I came from the State Department, but
                    -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Arthur Hartman was there at the beginning as a
                        young spear-carrier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Arthur Hartman, the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, and I
                    had jointly conducted meetings with what was then called the Davignon Committee
                    in 1973, during the so-called “Year of Europe.” Kissinger had given a speech
                    entitled “The Year of Europe” in early 1973. He wanted to revive our relations
                    with Europe, because they had been rather neglected - because of Vietnam, our
                    domestic problems, and our fascination with the Soviets and the Chinese. So he
                    came up with a new prescription for American-European relations. It didn't focus
                    much on the internal consolidation or unification of Europe, but more on what we
                    would now call trans-Atlantic relationships. One of the results of that speech
                    was an effort to define how best to consult between the United States and the
                    emerging European entities. One of these was the Davignon Committee, which was
                    intended to deal with foreign policy for the European Community (or European
                    Economic Community, as it was then called). They were increasingly getting into
                    overall foreign policy. So Art and I had a number of sessions with the Europeans
                    on how to organize a consultative system between the U.S. and the EC. At that
                    time, we were dealing with each of the member-nations individually, and they
                    dealt with us individually. The Europeans were trying - and they are still
                    trying - to work out their own decision-making procesand we did that together,
                    and we eventually reached some compromise arrangements for consulting.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>We always took the position (Henry really insisted on it) that if the Europeans
                    were going to put together a united position to present to the U.S., we ought to
                    be in on that process, because whatever they could put together was bound to be
                    a matter of compromise. It would have to involve very long and detailed haggling
                    among the different European countries. They would therefore be quite inflexible
                    in dealing with us once they'd reached consensus. It might be even harder to
                    deal with them than with the Soviets, because if we had a problem with their
                    policy, the Europeans would have to go back to the drawing board. But the French
                    said that the Americans should not participate in these earlier discussions
                    because these are supposed to be European decisions. Well, of course, other
                    Europeans told us not to worry about it; they'd let us know what was going on
                    anyway. That was, you know, nearly 30 years ago now.</p>
                <p>So, how European was Henry? He was obviously steeped in European history and
                    lore; very interested in lots of different aspects of it; very skeptical about
                    European unity, not that he wanted to foster intra-European opposition in the
                    old sense. He also applied some of the techniques by which European diplomacy
                    was conducted in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example, in the
                    China case, and with the Soviet Union, or even if you want, in a minor way, with
                    the Romanians or the Poles, and so on. But above all, with China. There was a
                    complex set of relationships. It was said of German Chancellor Bismarck when he
                    left office in 1890, that there was no one around who could understand the
                    complexities of all his conflicting commitments to the Russians and the
                    Austrians, and so forth. It wasn't quite that way with Kissinger, but still I
                    think that Zbigniew Brzezinski was much clearer in his view of the Soviet Union
                    when he came in as National Security Advisor in 1977. At the same time,
                    Secretary of State Vance saw things in a totally different way from Brzezinski
                    (they had serious differences)-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Cy Vance was eager to seek more of an entente with the Soviets than
                    we had done. Detente still turned out to be a better word, even though we
                    resisted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I'm sorry this is very long-winded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh! No! No! This is just great.</hi>

                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: This is a reflection on the Kissinger persona and on Kissinger. You
                    know, in later years out of government, he is still very much interested in
                    Europe and is still very much welcome in the courts of Europe or among the
                    upper-crust and political elites in Europe. He goes there all the time, gets
                    awards, and his books get published immediately in their languages, and so on.
                    So he still has these ties to Europe, and I think is to some extent reconciled
                    to something like the EU (European Union) developing there now. But he continues
                    to have interest in China and much else. It's really quite extraordinary how
                    broad-gauged a figure he is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes! You know, one of the things that came up, when
                        you mentioned the “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine,” - it sounds a little bit like
                        Evans and Novak were creating a club to beat the Ford administration over
                        the head.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reminds me of Yalta [conference during WWII among
                        Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill]. I mean Yalta was considered to be a
                        sellout, particularly for the Eastern European thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. Well, I can't remember whether Evans and Novak used the term
                    “Yalta” in that column and a follow-up column in which they reiterated what they
                    had said; but the term “Yalta” came up constantly in this mini-furor. Sometimes
                    it didn't strike me personally like it was “mini!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But yes, I think the Yalta business came up frequently. Now, I think
                    Yalta has been misinterpreted in many ways. In many places the Soviets were
                    already in control in Eastern Europe at the time. For example, they had troops
                    in Poland and were heading west and southwest to the Balkans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Red Army was there!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. But there are people who said at the time that the Soviets were
                    in all these places, but the Russians were devastated by the war. Now would be
                    the time to go after them and finish off the Communists, as long as we've gotten
                    rid of Hitler. That had been Hitler's dream when he went to war with the
                    Russians in 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In his bunker in Berlin in April 1945, Hitler, like Frederick the
                    Great in the Seven Years War (18th century) kept waiting for the alliance
                    against him to fall apart, which it actually did when Roosevelt died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Well, the death of Roosevelt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hitler thought, well, this means a new chance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right. But the alliance held. Still, Yalta is mentioned as a
                    “giveaway;” historians who try to put it into perspective don't get very far. I
                    don't mean to praise all of Yalta. A lot of it was blamed on Alger Hiss [a
                    senior State Department official later convicted of spying for the
                    Russians].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There's little or no evidence of that. After all, Churchill wasn't
                    exactly a pro-communist, and he was certainly a party. As for Roosevelt's health
                    - supposedly he was no longer sharp; and all of that. So there was a lot of
                    controversy about Yalta. Liberation [of the “captive nations” of Eastern Europe]
                    was the theme of the Eisenhower campaign in 1952. John Foster Dulles promised to
                    publish all the documents. But that didn't quite happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Roll back the Iron Curtain.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: My point about East European policy - not just at my 1975 discussion
                    with the ambassadors, which was mis-characterized, but even earlier - was that
                    it was going to be very difficult to break up the Soviet empire, but that
                    someday it would come under great stress. It was explosive because the Communist
                    regimes in Eastern Europe were, by and large, detested by their people. In order
                    to counter that, the regimes played on the national sentiment in Poland and in
                    Hungary and in Romania. Nationalism was precisely what the Soviets tried to wipe
                    out in these countries-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -in order to maintain their domination. I was expressing a hope.
                    Some time before I went to the White House, or shortly after, I gave a talk at a
                    meeting at Ditchley House in England. Somebody found some notes on that talk,
                    which were almost identical to what I said in 1975 to our ambassadors. I had
                    said this was a very dangerous situation, and the Soviets were lousy
                    imperialists. They could only repress or suppress these people and build up
                    explosive forces in these countries, and they really ought to be able to let
                    these countries have their autonomy. I said the Russians should make some sort
                    of a deal so that these countries would not be a threat to them in the
                    traditional sense of a military corridor of attack against the Soviet Union.
                    Their autonomy would mean they weren't going to blow up or revolt against
                    Communist dominance. I was attacked severely by many Sovietologists for even
                    suggesting that there could ever be Soviet leaders who would be prepared to
                    loosen their grip on Eastern Europe; that this was absolutely central to their
                    whole personality and identity!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, on that one, I feel I came out all right - because that's
                    eventually what they did, under Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course they did it and then destroyed
                        themselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In the process, yes, partly because they eased their grip on their
                    “satellites” so late. There was a prominent Sovietologist named Leo Labedz,
                    who's dead now, who was vehement in rejecting the idea that someone like me
                    could even suggest that the Soviets could ever have any other notion than a
                    totalitarian empire. Several others were similarly affronted by my even
                    entertaining such a notion. Well, it did turn out - not because I predicted it
                    necessarily (I didn't predict precisely how and where it happened) - but it
                    turned out to be a remarkably peaceful-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very remarkable, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -devolution of the Soviet empire. It still gnaws at the Russians'
                    insides because they lost their empire and their position in Central Europe. I
                    think it's part of the problem we have now in dealing with Russia, which is led
                    by former KGB men to boot, who have memories of power-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The glory days, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The memory is alive at this point.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things I might make a note of here is
                        that Evans and Novak were newspaper columnists. At least from my point of
                        view, I found them particularly vicious, rather nasty, and untrustworthy
                        columnists, but they had their own role to play, which was essentially, I
                        suppose, quite right-wing, but also looking for trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I knew Rollie [Rowland] Evans much better than I knew Novak. In
                    fact, I virtually didn't know Novak at all at that time. I've come to know him a
                    little bit since then. Evans I'd seen around town and at social occasions, and
                    so on. I was told this particular column was mostly a Novak column; and it was
                    just a few words that were taken out of context or changed. But their phrase -
                    “a permanent organic union” - was really the opposite of what I was saying. I
                    shouldn't have used the word “organic,” and I said in my testimony in the
                    Congress that I'll never use it again, because it does have several meanings.
                    But Evans and Novak were making trouble - no doubt - in an election year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: There was this mood running about this being the end of Nixon, and
                    the Ford administration being too soft on the Soviets, too eager for detente,
                    partly because of Kissinger's positions, which were suspect in some places.
                    There were some people in the government, mostly in the Defense Department at
                    the time, who felt that we were being too eager in negotiating with the Soviets.
                    In the 1976 primary campaign against Ford, Reagan ran a strong anti-detente
                    campaign (whatever he meant by detente), and some of his people did as well.
                    Ford, of course, won the Republican nomination in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the primary then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But I think there had been damage done on this issue in New
                    Hampshire, where the Manchester Union and its publisher, William Loeb, were
                    influential. Loeb was very responsive to these kinds of charges and allegations
                    and criticisms. I think Evans and Novak did see themselves as digging out
                    skullduggery in the government, one way or another, and especially when it came
                    to being “soft” on the Soviets-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -and soft on the Communists. So whenever they could find something
                    along those lines, they ran with it. Of course, a large number of newspapers
                    that printed their syndicated column-</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including The Washington Post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Washington Post. The newspapers didn't take responsibility for
                    the column; it was a syndicated column. I never quite forgave Rollie Evans.
                    Novak, I think, is unscrupulous, or he was. It's getting to be an old act, and
                    when I see him on CNN (Cable News Network) nowadays, he's combative; he's almost
                    a caricature of himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Evans should have found some way to acknowledge that this was a bad
                    call on their part. But anyway, personally I didn't suffer, except my soul
                    suffered, because I was a conscientious, life-long opponent of Communists, even
                    in England as a young guy when I lived in Manchester and got acquainted with
                    some extreme left-wing people there during the war. My hostility to Communism
                    went back to that time. The last thing I would ever have dreamed would be to
                    advocate the permanent incorporation of Eastern Europe into the Soviet Union. So
                    I felt badly. This controversy also brought out some anti-Semitic overtones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, this is always - it sort of underlies these
                        things!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kissinger, of course, was Jewish, so he got hit by some of it.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In previous years there had been the grain deal, where the Soviets
                    had managed to make us believe that they were in serious food trouble. Nixon
                    decided (or the Secretary of Agriculture decided) to sell them grain, but we
                    sold it at a reduced price because our experts thought the Soviets were really
                    in serious need of it. Then it turned out that the Soviets had plenty of grain
                    themselves, and the price generally dropped. This was called the “Great Grain
                    Robbery.” It was attributed to Kissinger, not so much to me, but to Kissinger,
                    who was seen as too eager to deal with the Soviets. In some instances, there
                    were clear overtones or undertones of anti-Semitism involved in the complaints.
                    That was painful. Some of the Eastern European-American ethnic groups had that
                    element in-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, particularly the Polish.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In some of their own publications, it was thinly veiled. But in
                    Warsaw, itself, there was talk about “the Jews in Washington.” It was rather
                    ironic, considering Nixon's own tapes with his anti-Semitic remarks, how many
                    Jewish people were in the Nixon entourage, from Henry Kissinger to Leonard
                    Garment to Bill Safire, who left later; and others, like myself, on the NSC
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But there were some mutterings around Eastern Europe that the
                    “Jewish mafia” was selling out to the Soviets, including with cheap grain. That
                    pained me. In later years, there was actually an entry in one of the
                    authoritative encyclopedias of diplomacy about “the Sonnenfeldt Doctrine,” which
                    is well-balanced and is okay. But it was a nasty thing; it was painful in the
                    sense that it was wrong and mischievous. It caused a diversion that was totally
                    out of order and unnecessary, given the troubles that we had anyway because of
                    all the other unhappy circumstances in the mid '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, I think this is probably a good place to stop
                        here. There are a couple things I'd like you to talk about. I'd like you to
                        talk about while you were doing this, from '74-'77, I guess, the Helsinki
                        Accords, and how you saw that [and] the impact, the actual impact, as you
                        saw it, of Watergate, and you've talked about, and other things there -
                        whether Chile ever came up or not - maybe that-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I can tell you now that I had nothing to do with Chile, but
                    when the Chilean political leader was killed in Washington, there was a guy in
                    town here who immediately blamed Kissinger for it, a fellow named Barnet-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Richard Barnet, whose best friend was in that car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. This is when, oh, well, I want to say, not Achillia,
                        but something like that [Orlando Letelier]-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, yes. Have you interviewed Dave Popper [former U.S. Ambassador
                    to Chile]?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No! I've tried to get him, and he says he's done one, and
                        I've never been able to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, he was Ambassador to Chile. I think Nat Davis [also a former
                    Ambassador to Chile] might have been involved also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I'd like to get Nat Davis, but he's off. Well, then
                        I'd also like to cover the Ford administration, I mean the changeover - if
                        you saw anything there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Just - are you taping this.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: All right. Well?talking about the Ford administration, we might talk
                    very briefly about Alexander Haig's leaving the Ford administration to become
                    SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander in NATO) in I guess, late 1974, after he'd been
                    Chief of Staff for Ford in the transition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. And then, energy and then, you mentioned
                        something, which goes back, but I think it makes an interesting story, about
                        Nixon's early trip to Paris and about the art and the children and all this,
                        if you - okay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Well, we have a certain amount of things to do before we move on. Let's start
                    with the Helsinki Accords. In retrospect, did these become more important than
                    they were felt to be at the time? What was the thinking?</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 was rather controversial in
                    this country, mostly on the right of the political spectrum. It was seen as
                    permanently legitimizing the borders that the Soviets had established in Central
                    and Eastern Europe in the post-World War II period, in exchange for what were
                    considered to be rather insubstantial, even if nice-sounding, propositions
                    concerning freedom for journalists, and other sorts of freedoms-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Freedom of movement-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Movement, religion, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Freedom to express an opinion...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Final Act, adopted in Helsinki in 1975, was the end-product of
                    bargaining that had gone on for years. Actually, the Soviets, back in 1954, had
                    proposed an all-European security system when the issue at that time was the
                    entry of West Germany into NATO, which took place in 1955. Their scheme excluded
                    the U.S. and Canada. The Soviets tried to throw a series of obstacles in the way
                    of Germany's joining NATO, but the idea of an all-European security pact was
                    generally seen as a Soviet propaganda maneuver, and really didn't get much
                    serious attention. The Soviets revived this idea periodically; in particular,
                    they revived it in 1969, shortly before NATO was to observe its twentieth
                    anniversary here in Washington, in April of 1969. There was a fair amount of
                    interest among the European allies and some of the neutrals (especially in the
                    Nordic countries) to take up the Soviet proposals on security in Europe. The
                    general instinct in the Nixon White House at that point - very early in the
                    administration - was that this is more of the same: the Russians had just
                    invaded Czechoslovakia in August 1968, and various sorts of sanctions had been
                    applied. Now the Soviets were trying to deal themselves back into polite
                    company.</p>
                <p>But in any case, in its 1969 summit meeting in Washington, NATO decided to probe
                    a bit more to see what there might be to this proposition of convening a
                    conference at an all-European level that would include all NATO and Warsaw Pact
                    members and neutrals. By 1973, there was a Preparatory Commission, and NATO
                    countries had made substantial changes in the agenda that the Soviets had put
                    forward. The Soviets were really trying to negate NATO, or what they claimed to
                    be the division of Europe into blocs. NATO's proposed changes in the agenda
                    involved a whole variety of issues relating to various freedoms - freedom of
                    movement, freedom of communication, freedom of religion, and so on - all the
                    conditions that were, in fact, not present in the Soviet bloc and in the Soviet
                    Union, itself. NATO was also seeking to soften a good deal of the verbiage that
                    the Soviets had put in about the dissolution of blocs (read “NATO.”) At some
                    point, Moscow conceded that the U.S. and Canada had to be part of any deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>The Preparatory Commission process went on for a couple of years. It actually
                    turned out that, in the course of those negotiations, there were some East
                    Europeans that didn't always observe discipline as dictated from Moscow on
                    particular issues. The draft paper became a long, long document covering of a
                    whole lot of topics: economic relations, confidence-building measures - that is,
                    pre-announcements of maneuvers, and limitations on the size of maneuvers, and
                    observers for maneuvers - and so on.</p>
                <p>In the end, it got to the point where everybody, more or less, was getting tired
                    of haggling on and on and on about every sentence. The Soviets had wanted to
                    wrap this all up with a grandiose summit meeting, again, for purposes of status.
                    The West Germans (led by Willy Brandt, who had become Chancellor of the Federal
                    Republic some years earlier) and some other countries were actually quite
                    interested in this. The Nixon administration, and Kissinger in particular, had
                    wanted to use a grand summit-level windup to the Conference on Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as a lure for the Soviets to be more constructive
                    in the Middle East and various other areas of interest to us, to hold that out
                    there as a possible reward for them. In any event, by 1975 it had reached the
                    point of wrapping it up. By that time, Gerald Ford was President. The document
                    proclaimed at the meeting in Helsinki is known as the Helsinki Final Act. It was
                    not a legal document; and everybody made a point to say it was a political
                    document. As such, it didn't require ratification by the U.S. Senate (and it
                    probably wouldn't have been ratified in this country).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: What was really quite remarkable, I thought, was the vigor displayed
                    by many of the Western leaders who showed up there: Helmut Schmidt from
                    German(Brandt had had to resign due to a spy scandal), Giscard from France, and
                    others, including, of course, President Ford. Their vigor and assured manner
                    contrasted sharply with the peculiar lassitude, or whatever one wants to call
                    it, of the East Europeans. The East Europeans stuck together in a cluster and
                    mostly talked to each other. Of course, they were polite to the Westerners, and
                    the Westerners were polite to them: the Western leaders tried to engage them in
                    conversation. The planned order of seating might put a Westerner and an
                    Easterner and a neutral sitting together, but the Eastern Europeans really were
                    self-isolated. They somehow felt uncomfortable in this company of Western
                    leaders, and even with neutral leaders. Amusingly, President Ford found himself
                    sitting next to East German boss Honecker.</p>
                <p>The most interesting thing, despite the criticism and concerns about the Final
                    Act in this country and some other countries, was what happened later.
                    Immediately after the Helsinki meeting, President Ford made a special point of
                    going to Poland and to Romania, to make very clear that nothing should be
                    construed in that Final Act as meaning that the United States was writing off
                    Eastern Europe and leaving it to the Soviets. He was quite deliberate in showing
                    the American interest in that part of the world, as were some West
                    Europeans.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>What was interesting and important was that, as time went on, various Eastern
                    European dissident groups developing, especially in Czechoslovakia and Poland,
                    were using language from the Final Act to justify what they were doing. It
                    really hadn't been anticipated that people would be courageous enough, and
                    regimes would be permissive enough in Communist Europe, to let that sort of
                    thing take place. Then, eventually, some Russian dissidents also proclaimed that
                    they based their appeals on the terms of the Helsinki Final Act. While that
                    didn't necessarily deter the Soviets from cracking down, the Final Act did
                    become more than just one more conference document.</p>
                <p>In addition, as time went on, there were follow-up conferences (after I had left
                    the government) which added detail to many aspects of the Helsinki Final Act.
                    And of course, they created an organization to oversee its implementation
                    (OSCE). The organization exists now; it's not a particularly potent
                    organization, but it does play a role now in being a human rights monitor,
                    overseeing treatment of minorities, and mediating disputes between members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's helpful in Yugoslavia, for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: For example, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And sort of an observer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Russians have come back, occasionally, to say that the OSCE is
                    really the organization that ought to be beefed up to be the security
                    organization in Europe, replacing NATO, although I think they have pretty well
                    dropped that now.</p>
                <p>It's worth noting that, here in this country, some people who had been severely
                    critical about the supposed “sellout” to the Soviets changed their mind when
                    they saw that the Helsinki Act was, in fact, doing some good. Now there's an
                    argument among historians and participants in these developments more than 20
                    years ago, as to whether and how much CSCE/OSCE contributed to the collapse of
                    the Soviet Union and of the Soviet bloc. I think historians will have to sort
                    that out in due course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it probably did. Several said that, you know, this
                        was not “the” critical, but it was “one of the.” It began to sap the
                        strength of the authoritarian regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, I think it helped. There were many other reasons that led to
                    the collapse of the Soviet empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>In any event, the only other thing I can say is that the weather in Helsinki was
                    absolutely magnificent in August of 1975. The Finns had brought their most
                    beautiful girls into Helsinki to serve as guides for the many large delegations.
                    The mood, actually, was pretty good. President Ford delivered what I thought was
                    perhaps the best speech of his presidency, at least up to that point. I had had
                    a little bit to do with drafting it, but that wasn't why I thought that. I
                    thought he delivered it well, and it had a lot of resonance in the big hall
                    there, filled with delegates. So the physical surroundings for this occasion
                    were memorable. I guess a lot of people who went back to their countries tried
                    to figure out what the impact will be. For the leaders from the East, Helsinki
                    was a unique event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the negotiations were underway, what was your reading
                        on this, you know, getting down to the personal? What was your reading on
                        this and the group you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, as I said, the U.S. government had never been particularly
                    keen on the idea of an all-European security pact - particularly since it had
                    started as a pure propaganda exercise, or even a Soviet political warfare
                    exercise. The Nixon administration was skeptical, quite skeptical, when this
                    proposal got tossed back into the game early on in the Nixon administration. As
                    I said earlier, it was seen largely as a gimmick to get the Soviets back into
                    some kind of relationship with the West after they had invaded Czechoslovakia.
                    But the attitude here in the administration was not particularly welcoming.</p>
                <p>Harlan Cleveland was still our Ambassador to NATO in 1969, held over from the
                    previous administration before Bob Ellsworth took his place as an appointee of
                    the Nixon administration. Cleveland thought that, tactically, it was not wise to
                    turn the Soviet proposal down flat, because there were West European governments
                    that were interested in it. Some politicians in Western Europe were quite
                    positive about trying something like that idea. So the U.S. position was not
                    totally negative, and the NATO position was not totally negative, as we met here
                    in 1969, and thereafter.</p>
                <p>An agreement was then reached to have a Preparatory Conference by 1973, in
                    Helsinki I guess it was, and we went along with that. The State Department was
                    very hard at work trying to change some of the draft language. That's what
                    diplomats are supposed to do, to negotiate endlessly with NATO allies to change
                    some of the terminology. They added a lot of what became known as “baskets”
                    relating to freedom of expression, freedom of movement and so forth, in order to
                    make the document more congenial and of interest to the West, rather than simply
                    rebutting the Soviet thrust to break up the alliances and replace them with
                    something very amorphous. That was clearly not acceptable.</p>
                <p>As I intimated earlier, I think that in a tactical sense, Kissinger and Nixon saw
                    it as opportunities for leverage, and also as a way for NATO members to work
                    together on a project, as the detente period began to evolve. I didn't like the
                    term “detente” then, but anyway, it's used.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the vocabulary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right?as “detente” evolved, this was part of the agenda. It wasn't
                    easy, but it actually worked out quite well. It became complicated later because
                    of the multilateral negotiations on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions, which
                    were largely a product of American domestic politics - for example, the
                    Mansfield Amendment, that annually called for reduction of U.S. forces in
                    Europe. We thought it was a good idea to have a negotiation going with the
                    Soviets, so that when people urged us to reduce forces, we could always say,
                    “no, look! We're negotiating about that. Don't undercut our negotiating
                    position.” So I think the MBFR talks were used in the Nixon administration and
                    in the NSC staff, and in particular by Kissinger, as an opportunity for tactical
                    maneuver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some years ago, quite a while ago, I think, I interviewed
                        George Vest -</hi>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes -</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Indeed he was. He was experienced and shrewd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He said that he would get reports, sometimes from the East
                        Germans and all, saying, “Well, you know, Henry Kissinger is a?I understand
                        Henry Kissinger isn't that keen on this. He's more interested in MBFR
                        (Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction) and all that, because he was talking
                        to Dobrynin - “</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe it's part of the thing, but he felt that he was
                        being undercut by Kissinger.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, you know, this was one of these cases where the real policy of
                    the White House was a bit different from the way the State Department saw it;
                    and that's, of course, part of the story of the Nixon administration-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The communications weren't always particularly good, and many times
                    were not good, because Nixon didn't trust the State Department. So there were
                    two layers: one, where the State Department people tended to take this very
                    seriously, professionally, and George Vest is an excellent negotiator. But there
                    was a second layer of instances when Kissinger was talking to some foreign
                    visitor or somebody-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was particularly with Dobrynin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Maybe, but it was not just Dobrynin; Kissinger had contact with top
                    people in other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kissinger originally was not enthusiastic about the CSCE project,
                    and he made some disparaging comments about it, though not about Vest
                    personally, who was a respected officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also it was a matter style, too, wasn't it? Please
                        correct me, but I get the feeling that if Kissinger wasn't on the center
                        stage on something...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't think it was a personal thing. There was a strategy
                    developing out of the White House in dealing with the Soviets; and of course,
                    the “back channel,” the famous “back channel,” was the primary means of
                    communication. And then there was summitry with Brezhnev, and then lots of
                    Kissinger trips to Moscow, and also the relationship with Dobrynin here, which
                    was part of the “back channel.”</p>
                <p>So I think CSCE was not such a main topic of his and Nixon's agenda. They wanted
                    to end the Vietnam War; they wanted to get some help from the Russians in doing
                    that; they got interested in some of the arms control issues; they wanted to
                    reduce the negative Soviet involvement in the Middle East; and especially in
                    summit meetings with Brezhnev starting in 1972, they wanted to take some of the
                    wind out of the sails of the “peace” movement in this country by showing
                    progress in relations with the Soviet Union-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -including on military issues. These included the Strategic Arms
                    Limitation or “SALT” talks, the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, and later,
                    MBFR to some extent, although as I mentioned, MBFR's main origin had to do with
                    countering the Mansfield Resolutions. I think that wasn't always clear. Not that
                    the people in the State Department were dumb - on the contrary; they were very
                    smart. But they didn't always agree with the way policy was being handled by the
                    White House. Communications just weren't very good until Kissinger, himself,
                    became Secretary of State. Then, some of these strategies became clearer to the
                    ambassadors and the senior officers in the State Department. They still weren't
                    sure they knew everything that was in his mind. But then, when Ford succeeded
                    Nixon in 1974, Ford's style was different from Nixon's. He didn't have a history
                    of distrust of the State Department. Actually, it wasn't just Nixon who
                    distrusted State: Kennedy referred to the Department as a “fudge factory,” you
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So the style changed a bit, and there was more communication.
                    Obviously, with Kissinger in the State Department, he used - actually much more
                    than is commonly though- some State Department people whom he found to be
                    intellectually very much on the alert and creative. He worked with many of those
                    people, even if they weren't Assistant Secretaries. If he found somebody below
                    that rank - maybe because the officer was helping out with a speech that
                    Kissinger was writing, or for whatever reasoif Kissinger found that individual
                    interesting, he would bring him or her into meetings, and involve this person in
                    actions. So there was much more communication, obviously, between the
                    policy-makers, the real policy-makers, and the implementing officials. Their
                    views very often may not have been acknowledged sufficiently, but they very
                    often did play a role in the policy decisions that were made, whether in the
                    Vietnam negotiations or on the Middle East or whatever the case may be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Well then, let's move to the Watergate. From your
                        perspective in foreign policy, how did Watergate impact on our ability to
                        deal? Watergate would be really '73-74, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. It obviously had a corrosive impact. I left the White House
                    to go back to the State Department in early '74. There had already been quite a
                    bit of Watergate controversy in '73. The interesting thing was that a lot of
                    foreign leaders and foreign governments, including the Soviets, didn't quite
                    understand what this controversy was all about.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, and, you know, most foreign observers thought this was a
                    trivial thing.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody does it!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Everybody does it, and why are you practicing regicide?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Canadians used to say, “You Americans have a history of doing in
                    your leaders,” and so on. Many governments continued to want to do business with
                    the United States on various issues. We had a stream of foreign visitors coming
                    through. Nixon continued to travel. Of course, he was trying to demonstrate that
                    he was an indispensable president. But obviously, it was, to put it mildly, a
                    distraction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It was hard for foreigners to tell, and perhaps for some of our own
                    people as well, whether some foreign policy initiative coming out of the White
                    House was an effort to distract attention from what was happening on the
                    Watergate front, or whether it had its own intrinsic merit. We saw similar
                    questions raised in the Clinton administration when the Monica Lewinsky business
                    was very prominent, the question of whether the White House was really trying to
                    divert attention from Clinton's political problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The movie, Wag the Dog-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wag the Dog came out just at the time, about creating a
                        [diversion]-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So there were such questions during the Watergate period, but all in
                    all, I have to say that we worked away at our issues, and we found Nixon
                    attentive. I still went to a feNSC meetings, where he was present; or I went on
                    trips with him, for example, to Moscow, to the Soviet Union in the summer of
                    1974. This was within a couple of months of his resignation. We signed a treaty
                    on underground nuclear testing, which had been prepared for that trip. These
                    were “home and home” affairs. Nixon went first to Moscow in 1972; Brezhnev came
                    here in '73; and Nixon went over there in '74. So despite Watergate, he went to
                    the USSR, and went through our full schedule of meetings, including sessions in
                    the Crimea with Brezhnev, at his Black Sea resort.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>In fact, there was an amusing episode on that trip, when we went down to the
                    house that the Soviet bosses used for their summer relaxation. There was a large
                    swimming pool, and we were all standing around. Brezhnev and his interpreter,
                    Viktor Sukhodrev-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the sort of bald guy with a big mustache?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No. This was Viktor Sukhodrev. He was a Shakespearean actor,
                    Russian, but he spoke fluent King's English and American English. Anyway, they
                    came and got a hold of Nixon, because Brezhnev wanted to talk to him. There were
                    little side places for private conversations, but the rest of us were all
                    milling around the swimming pool. We thought this was just going to be a short
                    conversation, “hello, how are you, and explain the craziness in your country.”
                    But it went on and on and on, and some of our people got impatient. Kissinger
                    and Haig wondered what in God's name was going on between Brezhnev and Nixon.
                    Was Brezhnev somehow trying to push Nixon into giving him something, while Nixon
                    was in such trouble at home? Or what was it? It may have taken an hour or an
                    hour-and-a-half before they finally emerged. I have to confess I never knew all
                    of what Nixon finally told Kissinger and others about what the subject was. It
                    had to do mostly with China, a long-standing Brezhnev obsession.</p>
                <p>I can't remember how much we talked about this before, but when Nixon visited the
                    Soviet Union in May of 1972, he'd been in China earlier that year.
                    American-Chinese relations were beginning to develop, much to the uneasiness and
                    chagrin of the Soviet - which was one, but not the sole purpose of our China
                    strategy. In '72, in the last hour of our meeting, Brezhnev had slipped Nixon a
                    piece of paper, a proposal which would have amounted to a de facto alliance
                    against China. Nixon looked at it and said, “Well, we'll have to study it,” and
                    so on. This paper was later changed into quite a different document, which was
                    adopted at the '73 Nixon-Brezhnev summit in this country. It was the agreement
                    on the prevention of nuclear war, which had some overtone of possibly being
                    directed at China. (Documents declassified as we speak indicate that Soviet
                    approaches to Nixon on this subject occurred before the 1972 summit.)</p>
                <p>In 1974, while we were waiting at his swimming pool, we were wondering whether
                    Brezhnev was back again on his China kick with Nixon in this private setting,
                    hoping to extract something from Nixon. This was a peculiar episode because of
                    some uneasiness, given Nixon's political condition by that time in the Watergate
                    situation. This summit was in June of '74, and that's just a couple of months
                    before his resignation in August. So it was-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't - I mean, it wasn't the old Nixon. I mean you
                        were-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, we didn't know! Nixon was a very shrewd guy. He didn't
                    generally let people pull the wool over his eyes; and he had his understanding
                    of the national interest, although he obviously was distracted by the Watergate
                    business. I personally was also curious, since it was highly unusual that they
                    would hold talks with no American interpreter present. The Soviet interpreter
                    usually was very good about telling us what was going on. So there was some
                    uneasiness about what in God's name were these two guys talking about. I guess
                    there is a record of it somewhere by now, but it would be a Soviet record. I
                    don't know whether the people who have been into the archives for that period
                    have a record, and whether Viktor made a complete MEMCON (memorandum of
                    conversation) of it, or kept some of it out of the memo, or had a separate one,
                    or whatever. In our case, I think it would be whatever Nixon told Kissinger and
                    Haig the subject had been. Then the trip went on.</p>
                <p>But that episode is a digression from my point that Nixon really continued to do
                    the country's business in foreign affairs, right up until the time he resigned.
                    The CSCE discussion that we were talking about previously was going on. There
                    were Middle East negotiations too, because we'd had the Yom Kippur War in
                    October 1973. Nixon (contrary to some allegations) was very much involved in the
                    decision-making about our involvement in extending military assistance to the
                    Israelis. At that time, we had a somewhat tight spot with the Soviets, because
                    they sent a rather threatening letter about the continued Israeli effort to
                    encircle the Egyptian army, and they seemed to be threatening Soviet
                    intervention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Third Army that was being encircled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, right, and that was in '73, in October. We had an energy
                    crisis, and so on. So there was plenty going on. It isn't that we were without a
                    president. Of course, we had many additional crises, including Vice President
                    Agnew's resignation, leading to Ford's designation as Vice President.</p>
                <p>All these things were going on, and so was foreign policy, and so was defense
                    policy. There is a story that Secretary of Defense Jim Schlesinger was worried
                    that some wild order might come to the military from the White House, ordering
                    some kind of a military action, as a diversion. I don't really know what the
                    truth is, but Schlesinger supposedly has been talking about his concerns about
                    that: his own orders to the military that there were to be no orders accepted
                    from the White House by the military, without his personal approval. So there
                    were obviously some things that couldn't be called “normal.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is just fine. Well, during this Watergate
                        period and after Agnew resigned, did you have any feel for how Ford as Vice
                        President, who was coming out of the House of Representatives, was being
                        melded into the administration on foreign affairs side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He was a good choice, I think, in many respects. He had enormous
                    experience in the Congress, and had some exposure to foreign policy as well. I
                    can't really say that I can recollect from personal knowledge his direct
                    involvement as Vice President. He came to meetings. There weren't that many
                    formal meetings of the NSC, the National Security Council, of which the Vice
                    President is a member. I think he was briefed, and he was kept informed. Then, I
                    think, as Nixon's resignation seemed more and more probable (I mean, it wasn't
                    clear; it might have been impeachment), I personally wasn't involved in
                    briefings, but I think Ford was kept informed of what was going on. How much
                    direct involvement he had, I can't judge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have any feeling that, you might say, the
                        bureaucratic system was gearing up to make sure that the presumptive new man
                        was going to be brought up to snuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, I think he was being kept informed of foreign policy issues. He
                    probably got intelligence briefings. I think Haig, who was the White House chief
                    of staff, kept him informed. I assumed Kissinger had meetings with Ford. I think
                    when he actually did take over, it was pretty smooth. Of course, we had to get
                    used to some of the new stafI was State Department Counselor by then, but we
                    worked closely with the NSC staff.</p>
                <p>Ford kept most people in place, but there was some shakeup. WheKissinger became
                    Secretary oState in '73, he also retained his position as National Security
                    Advisor. General Brent Scowcroft became his Deputy. Scowcroft actually had his
                    office in the White House, but Kissinger was still the National Security
                    Advisor, and that was initially carried over into the Ford administration.
                    Later, in October of '74, that was changed: Scowcroft became the National
                    Security Advisor. Ford also named Donald Rumsfeld as the Secretary of Defense.
                    Rumsfeld had been President Ford's chief of staff after Haig had gone on to
                    become NATO Supreme Allied Commander. The staff personnel, by and large, were
                    kept on board. There were a few additions that Ford himself brought on, more for
                    his own personal staff. So I think it was a pretty smooth transition, with most
                    of the principal actors staying on. There were changes eventually, at Treasury
                    and other places; but the replacements were mostly insiders, rather than a whole
                    lot of new outsiders coming in. And then, of course, the pardon figured in the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ford's pardon of Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Ford's pardon of Nixon. I, obviously, know nothing about what was
                    going on in regard to the pardon. There are all these stories about Nixon being
                    induced to resign in exchange for the pardon. I'm doubtful that that happened.
                    But in any case, I had nothing to do with it. I think, however, the pardon did
                    smooth the transition, at least as far as the functioning of the government was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, as just a government worker at the time, I
                        said, “Thank God.” I realized as a, you know, it may have, it hurt Ford
                        politically, but it, you know, I have a feeling we would still be having the
                        case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it would have gone on and on and on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And then Ford, of course, brought in Rockefeller as his Vice
                    President. He was well-informed on foreign issues, with much experience and many
                    resources. Kissinger was very close to him. That, I think, strengthened Ford's
                    presidency, although there were some Republicans who were not exactly
                    Rockefeller Republicans. But nevertheless, given the stature of Rockefeller, his
                    long-time interest in foreign affairs and his relationships with Kissinger and
                    some other people in the government, I think the transition, given the trauma
                    and the crisis that we had gone through, was a pretty smooth one.</p>
                <p>Now, of course, the shock effect of Vietnam was still playing itself out, and
                    Congress' action to withhold all arms support to the South Vietnamese, and then
                    the collapse of South Vietnam. There were incidents such as the seizure of the
                    Mayaguez, the ship that was captured by some Cambodians.</p>
                <p>There were some difficult moments. But in addition, Ford, for example, again in
                    my particular area, went to Vladivostok in November 1974 to meet with Brezhnev
                    to continue that relationship. That was set up through the old “back channel”
                    with Dobrynin and-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, I did go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the atmospherics there? The Soviets you'd been
                        dealing with, were they kind of looking at this new guy and wondering what
                        this [would mean]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, there certainly was that aspect. Of course, Dobrynin knew him
                    because Ford had been a leader in the Congress, but I don't know that any of the
                    other Soviets of consequence knew him personally. Obviously, they knew a lot
                    about him from their intelligence sources, and from reporting from their embassy
                    and other operatives in this country. The mood at that meeting was actually
                    pretty good, except that Brezhnev either had the flu, or my own impression of
                    Brezhnev (having seen him by that time over a period of several years) was that
                    he was not in a particularly vigorous state of mind. But he was sufficiently
                    vigorous, at one point, to get all his uniformed military out of the room while
                    he was talking with Ford about some aspects of strategic arms limitation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Whether that was just a show, and the Soviet military knew what was
                    going on anyway, or whether they really were excluded, I'm not sure. All in all,
                    that wasn't an easy first meeting for Ford, because everybody was watching him,
                    in Washington and then around the world; but it was, on the whole, a pretty good
                    meeting. Of course, by that time, we had the additional strength of having a
                    relationship with China, which had continued to develop since Nixon's first trip
                    to China. In fact, Kissinger went directly to China after Vladivostok to brief
                    the Chinese on the meetings, and to talk to them about whatever was on our
                    American-Chinese agenda. That, you know, gave us a certain amount of strength,
                    at least tactical strength, in dealing with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>But I thought that Ford understood the issues well. We had a couple of U.S.-only
                    meetings out in the cold, cold, Siberian-cold gardens outside this building
                    where the meetings were held, in order not to be listened to by Soviet monitors.
                    There were a few issues that needed to be decided in these negotiations. Our
                    security people checked the shrubs for microphones. The issue was how to
                    apportion missile launchers and warheads between the Soviets and us. One option
                    would have allotted fewer launchers to us but more warheads. Ford rejected this
                    because he foresaw criticism at home if we looked like we accepted a Soviet
                    advantage. Ford, I think, was quite well up-to-date on the details. It was an
                    okay meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I mean, you know, compared to some other times when
                        sort of, you know, using the term as the handlers, these are the people who
                        hang around and advisors; I mean you were kind of one of them. You talk
                        about when Nixon and Brezhnev gone, you had Ford, compared to later when
                        Ronald Reagan was president, you had some very uneasy people around

                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I wasn't in the Reagan administration, but as an outside observer
                    and with hindsight, I think a lot of the people that came in with Reagan were
                    tough cold warriors. I had my sympathies with some of them. And so was Reagan a
                    cold warrior who didn't mind tough kinds of words (nor did his speechwriters),
                    like “evil empire,” and so on.</p>
                <p>I think Reagan, in his own way, was a religious man who believed in
                    redemption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: When he eventually came to deal with Gorbachev, later in the '80s, I
                    think he reached the conclusion that maybe Gorbachev was the instrument of
                    redemption for the evil empire, and he'd started dealing with the Soviets, even
                    to the point of talking about the?well, virtually the abolition of nuclear
                    weapons-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Because Reagan, I think, was, at heart, a nuclear abolitionist.
                    That's where “Star Wars,” as it came to be called, came in, and it's the source
                    of the disparaging claim of missile defense as the idea of having a roof over
                    the United States to prevent nuclear attack. I think Reagan was groping and
                    looking for ways to prevent nuclear disaster from happening. I think he must
                    have thought about the day when he was going to be confronted with pushing the
                    button, without any other choice. I think he probably would have, if it had
                    actually come to that. But he clearly wanted an alternative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: However, I think he found it utterly distasteful, and he was looking
                    for ways to avoid all that, to see if we couldn't rid the world of nuclear
                    weapons. I think a lot of the people who had come in with him took only the
                    anti-Soviet part of his position and his attitude, and couldn't quite bring
                    themselves to realize the other aspects of it.</p>
                <p>Coming back to Ford: the problem that Ford increasingly began to have, in
                    addition to the collapse in Vietnam, was that the criticism of the Ford
                    administration's Soviet policy began to grow. Concern about decline in the
                    defense budget began to grow in some quarters of the American political class,
                    as shown in statements by the Committee to Prevent the Common Danger. That group
                    included a lot of senior people who had served in Republican and Democratic
                    administrations. That really was critical. [end of tape]</p>
                <p>They were really quite critical of the Ford administration and, almost by
                    definition, of some of the things that were done in the Nixon administration
                    with the Soviets. The criticism of the Ford administration: too much detente,
                    too many giveaways, too easy on the Soviets, too many illusions. I personally
                    got dragged into it with the canard of the so-called “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine,” in
                    which I supposedly advocated the incorporation of all of Eastern Europe into the
                    Soviet Union, in order to prevent thosEast European satellite countries from
                    staging a rebellion against Moscow. My actual views were 180 degrees opposed to
                    that idea.</p>
                <p>In any event, by the time the Reagan candidacy for the Republican nomination got
                    going in 1975 and '76, and then during the '76 presidential campaign against
                    Carter, Ford was on the defensive. I think he was unfairly on the defensive
                    because of the image that had been created in many places, including in the
                    Republican party itself. Ford did defeat Reagan in the primaries, although
                    Reagan did quite well and laid the basis for his candidacy four years later
                    against Carter. TheJimmy Carter picked up the theme in the general election
                    campaign in 1976, charging Ford with having too much detente and not enough
                    toughness. I don't know how much that actually contributed to Ford's defeat by
                    Carter. I think his defeat was, to some extent, a function of people's
                    uneasiness about Ford. Many different reasons have been analyzed by greater
                    experts than I can claim to be. Despite the fact that there had been a smooth
                    transition in very difficult times, despite the fact that we had left Vietnam on
                    his watch (the war began before Ford became president), and relief in the
                    country despite that tragedy, economic problems, and various other problems, I
                    think everybody agreed that Jerry Ford was a decent guy, a nice guy. I think
                    Ford's situation began to get tougher for him as the election approached, even
                    though Carter was a guy who had come from nowhere-</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: -as far as national politics was concerned. He and his advisors,
                    Brzezinski and some others, made Soviet policy an issue in the '76 campaign, on
                    the grounds that Ford hadn't been tough enough, and that if there was going to
                    be detente, it ought to be “real” detente and not a phony detente, and so on. I
                    found that criticism painful because I didn't think that was the right view
                    oJerry Ford. The hand we played was not the strongest at the time, although with
                    hindsight, it was a lot stronger than we may have thought, because we're talking
                    now about 14 years away from the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So there was much more inherent weakness in the USSR than we were
                    able to discern at the time. Ford's political opponents were also not discerning
                    it, because they thought the Soviets were getting stronger and stronger and we
                    were getting weaker and weaker.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weaker and weaker, yes. All right. Well, I think this is

                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Today is November 21, 2001. Well, let's maybe
                        before we get down to sort of what the Counselor was doing, what about, in
                        the first place, what were you getting towards, while you were or during the
                        Ford administration, about the Soviet Union, both intelligence and analysis
                        and from the [Soviet] Desk? I mean, whither the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I honestly can't remember in particular what was coming from the
                    intelligence agencies, and our own INR colleagues, regarding the long-term
                    outlook for the Soviet Union. Certainly, no one was suggesting that it was
                    entering a phase before a phase that would see its collapse. There were reports
                    - and we had our own observations - of Brezhnev's declining health, and
                    inevitable questions about who would succeed him. There were the usual debates
                    about the state of the Soviet economy, and there were continuing controversies
                    about the cost oSoviet military programs relative to GNP (gross national
                    product), and relative to the economy in general.</p>
                <p>By the end of the Ford administration (I don't mean the very end, but as we were
                    approaching the '76 elections), our relations with the Soviets were not
                    particularly good. They weren't deteriorating severely, but we had problems with
                    them about Angola, with Cubans there and Soviet activities. By early 1976, the
                    negotiations on strategic arms limitations were pretty well stymied. That was
                    partly because of disagreements in our own government. While it was not a time
                    of great advances in relations, it was also not a time of big-time setbacks in
                    our relations. As for the prospects of the Soviet Union itself, it was sort of a
                    murky picture. We did not, however, foresee an approaching collapse.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>There were continuing incidents involving dissidents in the Soviet Union, and
                    also, more seriously, dissidence in Eastern Europe, something that neither we
                    nor the critics of the Helsinki Final Act had really envisaged. But in
                    Czechoslovakia, and in Poland in particular, people using language incorporated
                    in the Helsinki Final Act were forming protest groups of one sort or another.
                    They were not exactly full-fledged opposition groups, but were on the borderline
                    of disaffection. It looked more and more as if the Soviets didn't really have an
                    answer to their long-term problem in Eastern Europe: that is, more and more
                    disenchantment with communism, and unhappiness about being under Soviet
                    domination. Of course, that became a campaign issue in the Ford-Carter campaign,
                    in the debates later in 1976. There were signs of an eroding Soviet position in
                    Eastern Europe, but nothing as dramatic as happened 12 or 13 years later. So as
                    I recall, it's a pretty murky picture, where the Soviet Union was still seen,
                    essentially, as our main challenger, opponent, and rival in many respects.</p>
                <p>We did have the Chinese relationship, which was becoming not exactly warmer; but
                    it was becoming helpful in dealing with the Soviet Union because of some of the
                    military aspects in the relationship with China. So that was a plus.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Well, you mentioned something about the State Department project. Was
                    this just, or should, I don't know, was there something entitled State
                    Department project? You had just mentioned this at the very end.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No. I was referring to the fact that these oral history interviews
                    are a State Department project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well now, as, particularly, we're looking more at
                        the Ford administration. What were you doing as Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I had become the Counselor of the State Department in the Nixon
                    administration, in 1974, and served as Counselor until March 1977. The Counselor
                    doesn't have a specific job description; he's responsible for whatever areas the
                    Secretary assigns to him, as a sort of a utility infielder on the seventh
                    floor.</p>
                <p>The arrangement was essentially that I would continue to deal with the issues
                    that I had dealt with principally in the NSC staff, which included East-West
                    relations; relations with Europe; NATO; and also some areas outside Europe, if
                    they involved the Soviet Union. The Under Secretary for Political Affairs,
                    obviously, wasn't excluded from those issues, but he would concentrate on the
                    rest of the world. First, Phil Habib, and then Joe Sisco (both career officers)
                    were the Under Secretaries. They of course had great expertise in the Middle
                    East and other parts of the world, where I was interested but didn't have the
                    expertise.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>I worked most of all with the European Bureau, led by Assistant Secretary Arthur
                    Hartman for most of that period. I had two or three people who worked with me in
                    the Counselor's office. They were assigned to me by the State Department
                    personnel people, and I'm happy to say that several of them rose to senior
                    positions in later administrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, Robert Blackwill was the first assistant who was assigned to
                    me in 1974, and he stayed with me for a year or so. He knew his way around the
                    building and helped enormously with keeping me posted on what was going on in
                    the Bureaus, and also making sure that we got all the materials we needed. Then
                    he went on to various assignments, including senior posts on the NSC staff.
                    Currently, as we talk (2001), he is the Bush administration's Ambassador in New
                    Delhi, India. [In 2003, Blackwill returned to Washington to a senior role on the
                    NSC staff, responsible for Iraq/Iran/Afghanistan.]</p>
                <p>John Kelly was also assigned to me to staff political-military issues in which I
                    was involved. He went on to a good career, was U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon,
                    Director of the Policy Planning Staff, and Assistant Secretary for Near
                    Eastern/Asian Affairs. And several others of my assistants had good careers.
                    Anyway, they were exceptionally talented officers.</p>
                <p>Jim Dobbins was an assistant of mine also. He had served at the UN as a
                    speechwriter for John Scali, the journalist who had figured in the Cuban missile
                    crisis, and who later became the U.S. Ambassador to the UN. Dobbins worked with
                    me on pretty much everything I was doing, mostly on Western Europe, which was an
                    area I was especially interested in. He went on to become Ambassador to the EU
                    and Assistant Secretary for European Affairs. He's had some extremely important
                    but really awfully difficult jobs. Right now, as we speak, he is the American
                    representative dealing with the Afghan political groups, which is a very
                    challenging assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Dobbins has done Haiti; he's done crises in other places, in the
                    Balkans, and so on. He's a very gifted fellow. So I was really blessed with some
                    very able people who helped me function in this job.</p>
                <p>Another assistant I should mention is Leon Fuerth, who came from
                    Political/Military Affairs and added real strength to my operation. He later
                    became Al Gore's principal national security adviser in both the Senate and the
                    office of the Vice President.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, I was interviewing somebody, and I can't, maybe
                        blessedly, I can't remember the name of the person, but who was dealing with
                        Soviet Affairs at the time. I mentioned the fact that I was interviewing
                        you, and he talked about this sort of dream team that you had working for
                        you, and he referred to them in rather uncomplimentary terms because he felt
                        that he was being bypassed. I really can't remember, but I mean, did you
                        feel there was a problem that-?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I don't know who that individual would have been. I think
                    people did feel they were being bypassed, but that wasn't because of me. That
                    was the Kissinger style. He worked with people whom he thought he could work
                    with. In general, though, if this individual was in the European Bureau, I think
                    Kissinger thought quite highly of Art Hartman, who was the Assistant Secretary,
                    and Soviet Affairs, of course, was part of the European Bureau.</p>
                <p>There had for some time been a bureaucratic issue because, back in the Dean Rusk
                    period, when there was at the upper reaches of the State Department hierarchy a
                    senior individual who dealt with Soviet Affairs. I think some people on the
                    Desks were not always kept fully informed. This also happened sometimes when
                    “back channels,” as they were later called, went back and forth between the
                    Soviet leadership and the White House.</p>
                <p>Now in our case: I don't mean to compare myself with either Chip Bohlen or Tommy
                    Thompson, who held senior advisory positions in regard to the Soviet Union over
                    the decades. There may well have been instances where my office had dealings
                    with the Soviets, because that was the Kissinger style, it was the Nixon style,
                    and Ford to some extent took it over as well, although that wasn't ordinarily
                    his style. But it certainly was the Nixon style, and the policy people in State
                    regional bureaus, especially EUR, resented not being fully informed. That was
                    also true with the arms control negotiating teams from ACDA. That started when I
                    was still in the White House, the “back channel” communications between
                    Kissinger and Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, and between Nixon and Brezhnev. There
                    was a “back channel” that kind of paralleled and sometimes got ahead of what was
                    going on in the front channel, the formal negotiations on SALT (Strategic Arms
                    Limitations Treaty) and on the ABM Treaty. This really started in 1971 -72, but
                    it continued after that. So the ACDA negotiators were sometimes put in the
                    embarrassing position of not having been told of what was going on in the “back
                    channels,” whereas their Soviet counterparts apparently had been informed. So
                    there were some resentments, and some people who were involved in this have
                    since written books and articles complaining of the practice. But my assistants
                    were all Foreign ServicOfficers-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: They tried the best they could, without violating the edicts from
                    the Secretary's office concerning secrecy. They tried the best they could to
                    keep people posted.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there, as often happens in a bureaucracy when
                        your chief, in this case being Henry Kissinger, sends out an order, you
                        know, “I want to keep this separated from this, or something,” those who
                        are, I don't want to use the term pejoratively because I don't mean it that
                        way, but the apparatchiks, the people that he would know, this just doesn't
                        work. It's all very nice, but you've got to keep people informed. So there
                        is a sub rosa taking people aside in the men's room or something and saying,
                        “You might look at this.” I mean was this going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I'm not sure. It wasn't going on with me. I have to add to all
                    of this, that I myself didn't know everything Kissinger was doing in the areas
                    that I was responsible for! Moreover, he also sometimes used people - whether
                    from the State Department or, when he still held the dual job of National
                    Security Advisor, somebody in the White House - for tasks I wasn't informed
                    about. Eventually, it often came to me through the grapevine. So that, again,
                    was the Kissinger style. As I say, my assistants tried, without violating the
                    rules of the game that governed these things in the Kissinger period, to keep
                    people generally apprized so that they wouldn't go off on tangents that
                    contradicted what was happening in these “back channel” communications.</p>
                <p>In another area that wasn't particularly focused on the Soviets: when Kissinger
                    became Secretary of State, he decided it would be a good idea to have a special,
                    very quiet forum with the Foreign Ministers of the UK (United Kingdom), Germany,
                    and France. This later became known as the “Quad” (quadripartite group). We used
                    the regular, formal, and well-known meetings on Berlin, in which these four
                    Western countries were obviously involved, for these discreet meetings, which
                    were usually held shortly before NATO Ministerial meetings. There would be a
                    separate discussion and a report to the other Ministers on what was going on in
                    Berlin. But Kissinger would add onto that a very discreet meeting to talk about
                    other issues, and that was kept very, very quiet. In later years, word seeped
                    out; but we kept it quiet, because it would have been embarrassing if Joseph
                    Luns, the Dutch-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The NATO Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -the NATO Secretary-General had found out that these discussions
                    were taking place. We covered a lot of territory, including issues outside of
                    Europe, in some instances.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>Later, in 1976, we had the problem of Eurocommunism (growing Communist and
                    leftist movements in western Europe), and worries especially about Italy and
                    some other countries. There was the Portuguese crisis, when the left-wing party
                    started taking over. This group of four Foreign Ministers met sometimes in
                    between NATO meetings. The three European governments used what they called the
                    Political Directories of their Foreign Ministries to staff these meetings, and I
                    was the guy who worked with Kissinger on this forum. We kept EUR Assistant
                    Secretary Hartman involved, so he knew; but the records of the meetings were
                    held very closely, and shown to only a few people. Gradually, these things seep
                    out, because the Europeans were not quite as tight about it as we were, and the
                    grapevine brings it back around to the State Department. Some people in the
                    Department worried that we were trespassing in their areas, and not telling
                    them. I think this sort of thing still goes on, although it's generally known
                    that it goes on. That wasn't particularly Soviet-focused though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. Well now, I mean, we're talking about - let's talk a
                        bit about Eurocommunism because you particularly, you had France, and you
                        had Italy and Portugal. I don't know Spain. I don't know if it was a power,
                        was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, Spain was then approaching the post-Franco transition time. It
                    wasn't quite there, as far as Eurocommonism was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway, Eurocommunism seemed to be a real threat. Did
                        you find that the British, French, and the Germans were playing a more
                        moderating role than say maybe Kissinger was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, they too were quite concerned about Eurocommunism. In the case
                    of Portugal, we had some slight differences with the SPD (Social Democratic
                    Party) in Germany, and to some extent with the French, but we kind of divided
                    our labors. We had some differences with our ambassador in Lisbon-</p>
                <p>Q: Frank Carlucci.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Frank Carlucci. A lot of that has been published now, but in the end
                    it all came out pretty well. But at that particular moment, it was a touchy
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was a very touchy business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. In the case of Italy, of course, the U.S. since 1948 had a long
                    history of intervening in Italian politics, and we gave money to some
                    individuals or parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've certainly given a lot of the money to the Christian
                        Democrats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: To the Christian Democrats, and to some others. There were some
                    questions as to what happened to that money. But there was a tradition, more or
                    less, of the U.S. trying to tip the scales against the Communists or the
                    left-wing Socialists. Some of those Socialists later became part of the Italian
                    Socialist Party, and dropped their pro-Soviet and old-line Communist attitudes
                    and policies.</p>
                <p>I recall one amusing incident. The heads-of-government summit meetings that later
                    became known as the G-7 (Group of Seven) meetings were started in 1975. They
                    initially involved five major industrial nation(the U.S., Germany, France, the
                    United Kingdom, and Japan). This group was something that Kissinger cooked up
                    with Chancellor Schmidt, President Giscard of France, and Jim Callaghan of the
                    UK, at a meeting held at the time of the Helsinki Final Act conference. We
                    agreed to hold a five-power summit meeting dealing mostly with economic issues,
                    but also with other issues. The first of these sessions was in Rambouillet,
                    France. There was an issue about the Italians, who were not to be included. The
                    Italians got wind of it, and they were terribly upset, as they always are, and
                    with some justification. At that particular time, they were especially concerned
                    that their government would become a laughing stock if they were excluded, and
                    this would play into the hands of the Communists and the left wing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had quite a respectable Communist leader,
                        Berlinguer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, but in any case, nowadays, different people take credit for
                    different aspects of this. The U.S. managed to get the Italian Prime Minister (I
                    think it was Rumor) into the meeting at Rambouillet. The Italians at the time
                    held the presidency of the European Council, so we used that to get the Italians
                    in. Japan was included because of its economic power, and it was part of the
                    “Library Group” oFinance Ministers and central bank heads.</p>
                <p>The second G-7 meeting was in Puerto Rico in 1976. It was called by President
                    Ford because he was getting quite concerned about the Eurocommunist issue and
                    some other problems. Of course, that affected Italy. In fact, we didn't tell the
                    Italians why President Ford wanted to call this meeting. The Canadians, in the
                    meantime, had also been added to the original five-power group, which made it
                    seven, and it was subsequently known as the G-7. It had an economic agenda, but
                    included various other related problems such as energy. But quietly, the
                    original four (the Germans, British, French, and the U.S.) met in a room
                    adjacent to where the Italians were, to talk about the coming 1976 election in
                    Italy, and what each of us would try to do to exert some positive influence. So
                    it was right under the noses of the Italians, but we never divulged any of that.
                    We subsequently had follow-up meetings at my level to work out the details of
                    what each of us would do, either financially or in other ways, to have some
                    impact on the election.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>That was part of the style of the period, but for the Italians, it established
                    them as a G-7 member. Since my days, there have been repeated instances (e.g.,
                    the Contact Group over ex-Yugoslavia) and other situations where the Italians
                    felt left out. There was the EU issue recently, when British Prime Minister Tony
                    Blair had arranged an impromptu dinner, maybe a month ago in London, that didn't
                    include the Italians; it was just the British, French and Germans. The Italians
                    were in an uproar. Berlusconi, the current Prime Minister, in effect invited
                    himself, and the other Europeans couldn't stop it. So this matter of recognition
                    and participation is a chronic issue for the Italians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what is the problem, I mean as you saw it at that
                        time, with Italy being a member of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, there was a problem in the mid-1970s because there was a
                    strong Communist and left-wing party in Italy; so there were issues of how
                    secure were things that you talked about. But I was very sympathetic to the
                    Italians. I thought they had been good allies. There were problems here and
                    there, but there were some very able Italians, including Manlio Brosio, who
                    served as NATO Secretary-General, and others. Their economy was still rather
                    shaky, although eventually they developed quite a sound and solid economy.</p>
                <p>For some reason, people just don't take the Italians - or didn't take the
                    Italians - terribly seriously. I thought that, if we needed to do things that we
                    didn't want the Italians to be involved in, we could do it discreetly. But when
                    these meetings became known forums, I thought the Italians belonged in the
                    group, so I tried to do the best I could. There are a couple of Italian
                    diplomats who've written their memoirs, who mentioned the fact that I was
                    helpful in trying to get them involved. One of them, Egidio Ortona, who served
                    as Ambassador in Washington for many years, was among the shrewdest, most
                    charming and best-connected diplomats I ever encountered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I remember; I think in his book, I can't
                        remember, in The White House Years or something, Kissinger writes about
                        landing in Italy and saying, really the only importance was to make the
                        gesture of talking. I mean, that in a way, it was very dismissive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, but-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this some of which is </hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Nixon, on his first trip to Europe shortly after his inauguration in
                    1969, made a point of going to Italy. Seeing the Pope was his principal
                    interest, because everybody regarded the Pope as a very influential figure with
                    excellent sources all over the world. But he did meet with Italian government
                    leaders, and his trip drew big crowds in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and also American domestic politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, and American politics. Italy, of course, is a domestic
                    American political issue; at least, shortly before elections it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But anyway, Nixon went to Italy at least twice during my time in the
                    White House. But those visits were mostly in the form of gestures rather than
                    for very serious negotiations or agreements. In later years, however, the
                    Italians were actually key to the deployment of medium-and-intermediate-range
                    missiles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They broke that, sort of the opposition, which was a very
                        important step.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. So I think some of this is just sort of a carryover from
                    earlier days. But in any event, I just wanted to add this little anecdote about
                    the fact that one of our problems, in the middle and late '70s, was the strength
                    of Communism and left wing crypto-communists in the political game in Italy. The
                    Italians were our allies, and they became members of the G-7, but we couldn't
                    really talk to them, at least officially, about their own domestic situation. In
                    Puerto Rico, it turned out that we used the G-7, although Italy had become a
                    regular member, as a means of consulting with our other European friends about
                    how to cope with the Italian domestic political problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we feel that the French Communist power had sort
                        of reached its limit? In other words, while it was, with its trade unions
                        and all, a powerful source, it just wasn't going anywhere, as opposed to the
                        Italian one, which might end up in the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, the French Communist strength was certainly a problem, but we
                    had an easier time agreeing with the French government about the fact that it
                    was a problem. In Italy, the lines were somewhat blurred.</p>
                <p>When the Socialist, Francois Mitterrand, became President of France (after I left
                    the government, in the early '80s), he included a Communist or several
                    Communists in his government. This was considered a pretty serious problem. This
                    was in the Reagan administration. Vice President George Bush was sent over
                    there, and somehow he gave it a blessing or was reassured. But there was an
                    ongoing issue with the French Left. I remember meetings with Mitterrand, when he
                    was in the opposition, at the State Department in the mid-'70s, that I sat in
                    on, discussions that Kissinger had with him, in which there was quite a vigorous
                    debate about the wisdom of the Socialists playing around with the Communists,
                    and forming a united front, and so on. Mitterrand gave his rationale for it. I
                    have to say (and I think I told him when I met him many years later, when he was
                    President) that Mitterrand's strategy, in fact, turned out to be quite
                    successful in diminishing the weight of the Communists and in isolating them in
                    the French political game by bringing some of them into the government.</p>
                <p>But in the 1970s, we were very uneasy about that prospect, and our successors in
                    subsequent administrations were also quite concerned about this. So the role of
                    these two big Communist parties in Italy and France, and then others in
                    Portugal, was a concern for us throughout all of these years, because we
                    essentially saw them as Soviet fifth-columns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Well now, while we're still on that subject, was
                        there any feeling that somehow the face of Communism had changed? In other
                        words, this Eurocommunism, was this a sort of a benign, Leftist, socialist
                        type thing -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or was this still a Soviet tool?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't think we ever got to the point in my days in the government
                    where we saw those movements as benign. We did see changes, not so much in the
                    French party, which was pretty-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stolid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Stolid, yes. But the Italians were a bit more mobile in their
                    political attitudes, even in the days of Togliatti (long-time Communist Party
                    leader, considered a Stalinist), but certainly in the days of Berlinguer, and
                    subsequently.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>We still felt they posed problems, however, because we thought they were
                    penetrated by the Soviets; and they were getting money from the Soviets, even
                    though they were striking off on somewhat different lines. This is why the term
                    “Eurocommunism” was used. Of course, we didn't think they were secure, and we
                    were concerned that the Soviets would very quickly know what was going on on
                    whatever issue. We still didn't like the idea of their joining the government,
                    but they were in the parliament as elected members.</p>
                <p>We had laws that excluded Italian and other Communists from coming into the U.S.
                    But some people in this country, scholars and others, thought it was a good
                    idea, since they were quite a strong factor in Italian politics, to bring some
                    of them over here in delegations of parliamentarians (either from the European
                    Parliament, where they were represented, or the Italian parliament), to acquaint
                    them with what was going on here. But our hands were tied by our legislation.
                    One individual in particular, the editor of the newly-founded Foreign Policy
                    magazine, named Richard Holbrook-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -constantly came to us with schemes to have Italian Communist
                    parliamentarians visit this country. We equally constantly had to say, “we can't
                    do it.” Under the law, thPresident had to certify that it was in the interest of
                    American national security to let somebody in who was otherwise disqualified by
                    the legislation. This issue got into the press, and it became sort of a running
                    argument with Holbrook and others. The fact is, what was happening in Italy was
                    very interesting. I became acquainted with a lot of these left-wing politicians
                    later, Napolitano and various others, who eventually became ministers in Italian
                    governments.</p>
                <p>But it was early in the process of their evolution, and we couldn't quite bring
                    ourselves to recognize the changes that were actually going on. Change in the
                    French Communist party was much slower. In any event, the President in the
                    mid-seventies could not certify that Communist visits served the national
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. We, also, with the Italians had our problems, as

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But the fact is, we have a large Italian-American population. So
                    relations with Italy, regardless of who exactly was in the driver's seat over
                    there, were a fairly major consideration for the political side of the U.S.
                    government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, on the European Union, or it was the European

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The EU was still the European Economic Community in those days,
                    EEC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, this has been a real cornerstone of our policy
                        since the end of World War II, and that's the idea of getting Western Europe
                        together in some way or another. This was developing, I mean, is this, you
                        know, as we look through the spectrum, you see we're moving more and more
                        towards what is now the European Union, but it's gone through various
                        stages. How did we view [it] at that time? Were we beginning to be concerned
                        that we might be creating at least a trade rival that's going to give us
                        real problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Looking at different levels, certainly in the trade area, and
                    especially in the agricultural sector, there were concerns about the European
                    Economic Community's and later the European Community's policies, and some
                    concerns about some other economic aspects. Some people were worried about
                    developing a “fortress Europe” on the economic side.</p>
                <p>Kissinger had had quite a long background in his writings on this subject. Back
                    in the '50s an'60s, in various books that he wrote, he was very cautious (to put
                    it mildly) about the consolidation of Europe. He predicted many times that the
                    major factor that would eventually tie the Europeans together, as they came
                    closer and closer politically, was their hostility toward the United States, or
                    at least skepticism about the United States. This would become the “organizing
                    principle,” as he called it. So he had his reservations about European
                    integration (see his book, “The Troubled Partnership”).</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>The official American policy was to advocate and support European consolidation,
                    but there were problems with the European Commission on economic and trade
                    issues, especially in the Kissinger period. I think to some extent Nixon shared
                    these concerns. We know that Ford had his own very, very strong feelings and
                    concerns about this.</p>
                <p>In an effort to manage these issues, we tried to get some political consultations
                    going with the Europeans as a group. It was very difficult. They couldn't really
                    get themselves launched on this. During my days, if there was some issue that we
                    wanted to coordinate with the Europeans at the political level, it would take
                    the Europeans weeks to come up with a common position in their political
                    committee - the so-called “Davignon Committee,” named after the Belgian
                    diplomat, “Stevie” Davignon, who led this political aspect. Once they agreed to
                    their position, they would be totally inflexible. Kissinger kept saying, “we
                    have to be consulted while you are putting your position together, or else we
                    will get into a situation where you have a solid position that you have arrived
                    at with great pain and effort over a long period of time, and we can't negotiate
                    with you because you don't want to reopen the question in your own crowd. So the
                    negotiations are even more difficult with you than with the Soviets.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Kissinger would say, “the Soviets at least have somebody who can
                    just say 'let's make this adjustment, or that adjustment.' You Europeans have to
                    go back to the table.” So he was skeptical. It was a frustrating thing. I spent
                    I don't know how many hours with the Europeans in various capitals in Europe,
                    usually with Art Hartman (the Assistant Secretary for Europe) with me, trying to
                    put together a modus operandi so that we could consult with each other on
                    political issues. We really didn't get very far, at least while I was in these
                    positions. Basically, we still dealt bilaterally with the Europeans to get
                    things done. [end of tape]</p>
                <p>Then there was one instance when thPresident of the European Commission came to
                    Washington. I can't remember which EEC President it was, but our Ambassador to
                    the EEC at that time was Bob Schaetzel. (He died in late 2003 or early 2004).
                    Anyway, an appointment was made for the European President to see the President
                    of the U.S., but for some reason, that appointment didn't show up on President
                    Nixon's calendar. So the visitors waited in the West Wing waiting room in the
                    White House. Finally, with great embarrassment, they were told that,
                    unfortunately, President Nixon can't see the President of the Commission. This
                    faux-pas caused a huge brouhaha with the Europeans, but above all with
                    Ambassador Schaetzel in Brussels, who said publicly that this just showed that
                    the White House didn't understand where Europe was headed, that it was in our
                    interest to cultivate good relations, and this was an insult, and so on. I think
                    this was a genuine accident, and not a deliberate effort to snub them.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>But, in any event, the broad answer to your question is “yes.” In that phase,
                    basically, we approved the idea of European consolidation. In fact, we thought
                    it was a great achievement that Germany and France had overcome the antagonisms
                    of centuries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stopping the civil wars...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: After World War II, and while the occupation of Germany was going
                    on, the Schuman Plan and the Coal and Steel Community were significant steps,
                    but there were problems. There were problems in our trade sector; and various
                    groups in this country, especially in agriculture, were very skeptical. Then, at
                    the political level, it proved to be very difficult to do anything collectively
                    with the Europeans, so we continued to deal with them individually. This has
                    changed somewhat in the intervening years, but still there are some real
                    problems. To some extent, the Kissinger view that I mentioned earlier has been
                    vindicated in recent years. I mean, some of the sharpest criticisms of the Bush
                    administration, of alleged “unilateralism,” and not participating in
                    multilateral agreements-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Bush Junior.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It's Bush 43, yes?some of the sharpest criticisms came from the
                    Europeans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Sometimes you got the impression that they were doing things
                    primarily because we didn't do them, or because we were opposed to them. But I
                    don't really want to talk about developments after my time in government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: They hadn't reached quite that point in the '70s, 25 years ago. On
                    the contrary, the problem was that the Europeans couldn't sort out their own
                    procedures on how to reach some kind of a position that we could then work out
                    in common.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that the intellectuals, the chattering
                        class, whatever you call them, sort of the people who made comment on
                        television or who write editorials and all this - I mean there's a distinct
                        class, we have it in the United States - were they almost unanimous in being
                        very skeptical about the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, I don't think they were, if you're talking about France. In
                    Italy, yes to some extent; in Britain, it wasn't unanimous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Many British intellectuals, including some from the Labour party,
                    but not only from there, participated in the magazine Encounter, which in fact
                    had been financed in the '50s and '60s through CIA, via the Congress for
                    Cultural Freedom. There were strong anti-Communists in all of those
                    countries.</p>
                <p>So, skepticism toward the U.S. wasn't unanimous. Some significant figures weren't
                    necessarily totally uncritical of the U.S., but they were basically with us on
                    most of the important issues. On Vietnam, they were not so sympathetic because
                    it wasn't going well, and the “peace movement” in the U.S. spread to Europe. But
                    on the broad values issues - concerns about the Soviet Union and Communism -
                    there was far from unanimous opposition to the U.S. You also have to remember
                    that some people on the Left were not Communists, and some had even opposed the
                    Communists in their home politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In fact, the Communists hated them, because they thought they stole
                    their thunder and weren't revolutionary enough in their attitudes; they were too
                    much reform-oriented. Of course, many former Communists who had left the party
                    and moved to other parts of the political spectrum suffered for that by being
                    ostracized, or even worse in some instances.</p>
                <p>No, I don't think we had a monolith against us, but there were some people in the
                    intellectual community who were critical of the U.S. or the value system of U.S.
                    life. Some of those people are still around. Some Europeans formed something
                    like the American Council on Foreign Relations, to work with our organizations.
                    But our own Council on Foreign Relations wasn't always a strong supporter of
                    American governmental policies. Over time, more writings began to appear to
                    counter the rather harsh left-wing polemics in the West European countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling about where President Ford stood
                        on, say, the Western European issues and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He'd been around Washington for a long time, and I think that, in
                    general, his instincts were in favor of European unity - not necessarily in
                    detail, but in general, I think he thought that was a good idea. He also felt
                    that the Europeans were our major allies. I think Nixon had also felt that,
                    although he was skeptical about some aspects of it. So I think Ford had quite
                    good relations with European leaders. Together, they founded the G-7 forum, in
                    which he was quite interested. In Helsinki, during those two or three days of
                    ceremonies before the adoption of the Helsinki Final Act, I remember many
                    occasions at which Ford had animated conversations with West European leaders.
                    So I think his instincts on the whole were quite positive toward Europe, and
                    also toward European unity. On details, he probably had reservations here and
                    there.</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: I'm sure there are things I didn't know about. Again, my memory
                    isn't that great, but I do notice from time to timfor example, both in
                    Dobrynin's own memoirs and in Kissinger's books, that they wrote years
                    latereferences to meetings that I don't think I knew about. I think I learned of
                    the decisions that eventually came out of these meetings, because they had to be
                    part of what we were doing. But I don't think I knew, and I don't know that many
                    other people (except maybe Haig, when he was Kissinger's Deputy, and possibly
                    Henry's own immediate assistant) knew when Kissinger and Dobrynin were meeting
                    in the Map Room in the White House, or the special arrangements that were made
                    for Dobrynin's car to have access to the basement garage of the State
                    Department, so that it wouldn't be visible parked outside. I knew about some of
                    those sessions. I may have sat in on one or two or three or four of them, but
                    not on the dozens of them which were held.</p>
                <p>Some of the Kissinger-Dobrynin talks, however, were by telephone. For example,
                    during the Yom Kippur War, things got quite hairy between us and the Soviets in
                    late October 1973. First of all, Kissinger led a small secret delegation to
                    Moscow. I was in that group, which negotiated the text of what became UN
                    Resolution 338, that we hoped would stop the fighting. But that involved
                    stopping the Israelis, who were then in process of decimating the Egyptians. The
                    Soviets were getting quite itchy about their allies, the Egyptians; the Soviets
                    had supplied a lot of their military equipment. Kissinger and our group came
                    home from Moscow via Israel, where Kissinger had a talk with Golda Meir, the
                    Israeli Prime Minister. He told her, “you have another 48 hours, and then you've
                    got to stop beating up on the Egyptians, because it'll get us into serious
                    problems with the Soviets if you encircle the Egyptian Third Army and destroy
                    it-”</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>-or take them prisoner, and so on. But the Israelis wouldn't stop. After we got
                    back to Washington, we got this telephone call from Dobrynin. He was relaying a
                    message from Brezhnev which was quite threatening in tone, urging the U.S. to
                    stop the Israelis, or else put American and Soviet military forces on the ground
                    in Israel and Egypt - the U.S. in Israel, the Soviets in Egypt. I forget the
                    precise language. This was 'phoned in by Dobrynin. We held emergency meetings in
                    the White House basement. One decision was to raise the readiness status of our
                    military forces, as a signal to the Soviets that we weren't going to take any
                    dispatch of Soviet forces lying down. Well, our answer was sent back via
                    Dobrynin, and I think it was also done by telephone, as the fastest way in the
                    middle of the night to get the message back to Brezhnev. It was generally known
                    that this exchange was going on through this particular channel. In fact, it was
                    reported in the press the next day.</p>
                <p>I was closely involved in that episode because I drafted the proposed answer to
                    the Soviets on a typewriter, while we were discussing the various possibilities.
                    Eventually, the fighting petered out. That actually led to the first series of
                    Kissinger's “shuttle diplomacy” trips to the Middle East.</p>
                <p>Once again, the Soviets (as in earlier Middle East conflicts) really had
                    maneuvered themselves, by the hoopla that they raised, into a position of being
                    losers in that particular crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were forced to step down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. Some mild concessions were made, just as a matter of
                    psychology, to allow some Soviet observers to go to Egypt, though not exactly to
                    police the cease-fire that then came into force. Then we and the Soviets voted
                    together to enact Resolution 338 in the USecurity Council. This is now is part
                    of the Bible of the Middle East Arab-Israeli conflict, the language in
                    Resolutions 242 and 338 regarding Israeli settlements in the disputed
                    territories. Incidentally, this episode showed the advantages of having the
                    “back channel,” so that we could do these things as fast as we did. Dobrynin
                    clearly had access to Brezhnev, a direct link, to get these decisions made. But
                    some of the negotiation was done in a much more secretive way, and I'm sure
                    there was a good bit of it that I wasn't aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you mentioned you helped draft a response. What was
                        our initial response?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Our initial response was essentially to say, “no, no military
                    forces; but we can talk about having some joint observers when this is settled.”
                    I can't give you the precise language. It's in the published literature: the
                    crisis has been described by Kissinger and the documents are being declassified
                    by the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>Incidentally, this response later became very controversial. It is still
                    criticized by some people who contended that this decision was taken illegally
                    at an NSC meeting at which the President was not present. President Nixon was in
                    his family quarters. There were rumors that he was drunk and in a stupor, and
                    that Al Haig, who was then White House Chief of Staff, had carried to Nixon
                    whatever the group that met in the Situation Room had decided to recommend. We
                    called it the “Washington Special Action Group” - it wasn't an NSC meeting. The
                    rumor was that Haig took our recommendations up to the President, and that he
                    approved them; but that, in fact, President Nixon was not “with it.” Some
                    critics have written about the illegality of making all these decisions without
                    the President actually being involved. The question still rattles around in some
                    of the studies of the way this particular crisis was handled. The case has been
                    well researched and written up, but I can't give you the precise language.</p>
                <p>I see in my mind's eye the transcription of Brezhnev's phone call, which Dobrynin
                    delivered. It was about a half-page. It was leaked, and I think it showed up the
                    next morning in the newspaperincluding the particularly threatening language
                    which Dobrynin said Brezhnev had used in his message: that “we cannot
                    countenance this” or “we cannot tolerate that.” This was pretty strong language,
                    in diplomatic terms.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we had intelligence indicating that a Soviet ship was passing
                    through the Turkish straits with something nuclear aboard; and we also thought a
                    Soviet amphibious ship that was normally stationed in the eastern Mediterranean
                    was now heading toward Egypt; and we also thought we saw some movement among
                    Soviet airborne troops - so that we weren't exactly sure whether they were just
                    trying to bluff us, or what was happening. The U.S. Sixth Fleet was already in
                    the eastern Mediterranean and already on a high state of readiness, even before
                    our military declared a DEFCON-3 (Defense Condition 3) for many of our forces.
                    This is not the very highest level alert, but it raises certain readiness
                    levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: It looked that night (I think it was the 25th oOctober, 1973) that
                    the situation was getting a little hairy, that the Soviets might be losing their
                    cool. The “back channel” turned out to be a good thing: the fact that Nixon and
                    Brezhnev knew each other and talked with each other; and that Dobrynin and
                    Kissinger had this channel, and Dobrynin could get directly to the Soviet
                    leader; and Kissinger, of course, could get to President Nixon. If we had had to
                    work this crisis negotiation through complicated diplomatic channels, it might
                    not have worked quite that smoothly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, essentially what we were getting to the
                        Soviets with, really was, you know, cool it! We're working on this! I mean
                        we're not trying to?we both want, essentially, the same thing and that is
                        for these two forces to back off.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, we certainly didn't want a war! I think our common objectives
                    probably ended at that point. I think the Soviets, essentially, were still
                    supporting the Egyptians; although I think there had been episodes, starting in
                    1956, where the Soviets didn't really actively help their clients. In 1956, the
                    Egyptians weren't quite clients yet, and in-</p>
                <p>Q: Sixty-seven.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And in '67 (the Six-Day War) and '73 (the Yom Kippur War) - in the
                    end, when things got hairy, the Soviets just weren't there to help them
                    militarily. They'd sold or given the Egyptians a lot of military equipment and
                    provided training and spare parts, but they were very quick to evacuate their
                    nationals from the region, and in the end, they didn't really come in to help. I
                    think this was one of the factors that eventually induced Sadat to make his
                    Israeli pilgrimage, or in any case, to change policy and go to Jerusalem. This
                    happened later, in the Carter administration.</p>
                <p>I think Soviet influence in the Middle East gradually declined because, when the
                    chips were down - whether it was the Syrians or the Egyptians, or the Iraqis
                    later - the Soviets backed off. The Yom Kippur War was a dicey thing, because
                    the Egyptians really made very fast headway when they first crossed the Suez
                    canal and then the Sinai, attacking Israel. We were slow in re-supplying the
                    Israelis with military equipment because of delays in getting the operation
                    organized and some problems at Defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something we clearly support, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So for a period, the situation was hairy, until the Israelis then
                    turned the battle around. There had also been a significant intelligence failure
                    in Israel. They had thought that Jordan was going to attack Israel, but the
                    attack turned out to come from Egypt; and the Israelis had to shift their
                    military forces around to the west.</p>
                <p>Overall, I think the Soviet position eroded, and then Kissinger's shuttle
                    diplomacy really cut them out almost completely in the following years, until he
                    left office in early '77. In the end, I think Soviet policy in the Middle East
                    was a failure. It didn't consolidate their influence. They became resentful, and
                    it cost them a lot. The Russians are still waiting to collect payment from Iraq
                    for all the military equipment that they scattered around that region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, this is probably a good place to stop, I
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>

                        wasn't on your plate, but it still had an effect. I don't know how much
                        we've talked about it before, but I just don't want to miss it - our

                </p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Actually, I was in New York with Kissinger at the UN General
                    Assembly, and we were sitting in the American Ambassador's residence in the
                    Waldorf Towers, watching the debate with Tony Crosland, the British Foreign
                    Secretary. I think there were just the three of us. We thought that Ford had
                    done very well overall, but we didn't particularly like that exchange in answer
                    to Max Frankel's question about Poland. I think Henry later tried to call
                    Scowcroft, who was with Ford, to see if they couldn't clarify what Ford had
                    intended to say about Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>Then I had to leave to meet somebody. I had just gotten into the car that was to
                    take me to my next meeting, and when I turned on the radio, I found that this
                    whole Polish debate had provoked a storm, and that Ford was in deep trouble over
                    his statement about Poland not being under Soviet control. Many people think
                    that it turned the election to Carter. When I saw Ford after the election, I
                    kept saying, “You know, I still feel terrible about what I may conceivably have
                    done to affect the election.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, no, no, no, no! That's not really?don't worry about it. It's my
                    fault,” or words to that effect.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, we'll talk about this the next time, as well as the other things I
                    mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Okay.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Today is December 12, 2001. Why don't we complete
                        the Poland debate? We didn't really say what the problem was. For somebody
                        who wanted to know this, what was the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: One of the journalists participating in the second televised
                    presidential debate in the 1976 presidential campaign, Max Frankel of The New
                    York Times, asked a question about Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. I don't
                    recall exactly how he had formulated the question. Of course, the alleged
                    sell-out of Eastern Europe had been a controversial issue in American politics
                    since the start of the Cold War. The Soviet Army's presence in Eastern Europe
                    led to Soviet-dominated governments in Poland and in other countries,
                    contributing much to the start of the Cold War. In any event, in the debate, I
                    think Carter answered first, and was critical of what he claimed was the
                    administration's unwillingness to push the Soviets to free Eastern Europe. I
                    think he also criticized the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which had been
                    condemned by many conservatives who felt that it gave too much to the Soviets.
                    That theme was picked up by Carter's advisors.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The critics of Helsinki claimed that it froze existing borders and
                    political regimes in the status quo.</p>
                <p>Ford then gave his answer, during which, at one point, he said, “There is no
                    Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and of Poland.” I guess Carter had mentioned
                    Poland.</p>
                <p>Frankel, following up on his question, asked Ford, “Did you really mean to say,
                    Mr. President, that the Soviets are not dominating the people and countries of
                    Eastern Europe?”</p>
                <p>Ford reaffirmed his statement that the Soviets weren't dominating the region. And
                    then they went on to other questions.</p>
                <p>This exchange made a lot of people perk up their ears. The three of us
                    (Kissinger, the British Foreign Secretary and I), sitting up there in the
                    Waldorf Towers, thought that what Ford was trying to say was that the Soviets
                    didn't dominate the minds and hearts of people in Eastern Europe, and that we
                    did have active contact with these people. In any event, Ford's statement became
                    an issue that the press and lots of others made a great deal of, claiming either
                    that it showed Ford's incompetence or that it confirmed that we were really
                    quite content with the status quo in Eastern Europe. As I indicated in our last
                    conversation, Kissinger was trying to reach his deputy, Brent Scowcroft, to see
                    if he could put out a clarification making the point that Ford's comment dealt
                    not with the Soviets' physical domination of Eastern Europe, but with their
                    failure to dominate people's thoughts and feelings. I gathered afterwards that
                    Scowcroft had had something similar in mind, but that President Ford wasn't
                    inclined to have himself corrected by his own Deputy Assistant for National
                    Security Affairs. So this misunderstanding just rattled around through the
                    remaining few weeks of the presidential campaign. In the post-election
                    post-mortems, the second debate was regarded by some, perhaps by many analysts,
                    as a turning-point in that campaign.</p>
                <p>Even earlier that year, in the Republican primary campaign in New Hampshire and
                    elsewhere, Reagan had made very critical comments about the Ford
                    administration's policies on Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. His critique
                    was based on the Helsinki Final Act, and based directly or indirectly on the
                    so-called “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine,” which allegedly called for continuinSoviet
                    domination of Eastern Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>I had been quoted from a leaked telegram reporting on a Chiefs of Mission meeting
                    in London in December of 1975, as allegedly saying that I thought the danger of
                    war over Eastern Europe was so great that the best thing would be for Eastern
                    Europe to become part of the Soviet Union. In fact, this was 180 degrees
                    opposite to what I said and to everything I believed! But the misquote got
                    picked up in the press, and some Members of Congress and leaders of Eastern
                    European-American organizations raised alarms. So the “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine”
                    became a Republican campaign issue, and then later Carter picked it up after
                    Ford won the Republican primary.</p>
                <p>This was unfortunate, but maybe it would have happened anyway because of the way
                    the Helsinki Final Act was condemned by conservatives in the media. In any
                    event, American policy towarEastern Europe reappeared as a major issue in
                    American domestic politics. Groups in various parts of the country whose members
                    were oEast European ancestry were outraged about what I had allegedly said, and
                    were also hostile to the Helsinki Final Act. I guess it cost the Republicans
                    some votes in places on which they'd normally counted for support, because the
                    Democrats had long been stuck with “selling out Eastern Europe at Yalta-”</p>

                <p>In the meantime, the very eloquently-written synopsis of the discussion at the
                    Chiefs of Mission meeting in London in 1975, where I led a seminar on Eastern
                    Europe, has been declassified and published. It was that synopsis (written by
                    Warren Zimmermann, a Foreign Service Officer who was present at the meeting)
                    which was leaked, with my comments completely distorted by the columnist who
                    publicized it, Robert Novak.</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: In any event, Warren Zimmermann's telegram reporting on my talk has
                    been officially declassified, and I guess it will appear in some of these Cold
                    War history volumes that are being published. His account is not a full verbatim
                    text, but a very elegantly-written paraphrase and synopsis.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>What I had actually said was that the East Europeans were in a strait-jacket, and
                    it was to be hoped that someday there would be a Soviet leadership that would
                    understand that the people of Eastern Europe needed to have a sense of identity,
                    and had a right to patriotism like everybody else did; and that it would be
                    positive if the Soviets would be prepared to allow a “more natural relationship”
                    with their neighbors to the west. In another sentence, I used the word “organic”
                    as a synonym for “more natural,” by which I meant a more natural relationship.
                    It turns out that I shouldn't have used the word “organic,” because its other
                    meaning is “part of a whole” - and that's what was taken, and distorted by my
                    critics to mean that I advocated that Eastern Europe should formally become part
                    of the USSR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: This is what was criticized by a) the people who leaked the
                    telegram, and b) the journalists, who were the only ones in town that saw
                    anything remarkable in this telegram - but apparently not so remarkable that
                    they didn't feel it necessary to change my wording. The lead in the article that
                    Bob Novak wrote for the Evans and Novak column, in early spring of '76, was that
                    a close confidant of Henry Kissinger urged, at a secret meeting of American
                    ambassadors, that in order to prevent World War III from breaking out over
                    Eastern Europe, the U.S. should advocate the “organic union” of Eastern Europe
                    and the Soviet Union. Of course, what I had actually said was that there should
                    be a relationship in which the Eastern Europeans would have freedom. So that
                    misinterpretation became known as “the Sonnenfeldt Doctrine.”</p>
                <p>I tried to correct the misunderstanding at a press conference held some days
                    later at the State Department. I also testified in the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee, which was chaired by Rep. Clement Zablocki, a Wisconsin Democrat who
                    had a large Polish-American constituency in his district. I tried to explain
                    that maybe my use of the word “organic” was a poor choice, and I swore (with my
                    right hand held up) that I'd never use that word again. I explained that what I
                    had clearly meant, in the context of my talk, was that it would be in the Soviet
                    interest, as well as in the interest of all the people of Eastern Europe, and of
                    everybody else, for the Eastern European countries to attain a high degree of
                    freedom and autonomy, and not be satellites dominated by the USSR.</p>
                <p>But it seems you never can get rid of those misunderstandings-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>

                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -and they persist even now, nearly thirty years later. In the summer
                    of 2003, when Robert Novak was celebrating the 40th anniversary of his
                    syndicated column, he was aske(by Larry King, on CNN-TV) what he thought was his
                    best column. Novak answered without an instant's hesitation, “the column about
                    the Sonnenfeldt Doctrine,” which, he said, showed that the Ford administration
                    was unwilling to challenge the Soviets in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, serious observers have written about it, and written quite
                    fairly about it. When this thing was first leaked, some columnists in the New
                    York Times (Cy Sulzberger and others) had originally written indignant articles
                    about the “sellout” of Eastern Europe by the Ford administration, and how
                    finally the truth was to be known, that the “realism” of Kissinger's foreign
                    policy meant that you deal with the Soviets, regardless of how they mistreat
                    their neighbors. Those journalists retracted that charge when they saw the
                    actual text of the summary of my talk, and also after I had responded to
                    questions at a press conference and in Congress. But it's still around. It was
                    an issue in the '76 campaign, to my deep regret, I must say. But Ford was always
                    very generous about it when I saw him in later years, and I've told him I just
                    feel terrible about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you been aware of any - I mean I realize that this is
                        between Kissinger and Ford. But were you aware of any, prior to all this
                        thing coming up, of Kissinger spending a good bit of time working with Ford
                        to explain the situation in Eastern Europe and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't know how much he had done that. But Ford had been in
                    Congress for many years, and he certainly understood that Poland and other
                    countries were dominated by the Russians. There must have been some discussions
                    of it, because it became a campaign issue-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -first in the Republican primary campaign, and then in the 1976
                    general election. But I don't know how much time Henry may have spent with
                    President Ford on this issue during the campaign.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>In fact, we had struggled at the time of Helsinki, the previous year, when there
                    was a very negative reception, at least in some quarters in the U.S., to the
                    Helsinki Final Act. Critics charged that Helsinki simply confirmed the status
                    quo in Eastern Europe, in exchange for vague Soviet concessions. Ford, like
                    Nixon before him, had made several visits to Eastern Europe. In fact, because of
                    the criticism of Helsinki, he made a special point of visiting Poland and
                    Romania, which was the most rebellious of the “satellites.” Nixon had done this
                    also. Romania under Ceausescu was certainly not the most palatable, but
                    definitely the most deviant of the East European countries. Both Nixon and Ford
                    also visited Tito in Yugoslavia, to show that we had no hesitation going to
                    Eastern Europe or Central Europe, and indeed, had no hesitation at the highest
                    level of paying these much-publicized official visits. George Bush, as Reagan's
                    Vice President, also went to Hungary and some other countries.</p>
                <p>Of course, we recognized that any active effort to liberate these countries, by
                    whatever means, would be considered by the Soviets as a threat to their vital
                    interests. In the nuclear age, there wasn't anybody who was seriously inclined
                    to conduct a policy of deliberate, conscious undermining of the regimes there
                    and of the Soviets, although we supported Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe
                    and many other activities.</p>
                <p>The remarkable thing (we may have talked about this before) is that after the
                    Helsinki Final Act was signed, there were groups in Czechoslovakia and Poland,
                    and even in the Soviet Union itself, who used the language and the terms of the
                    Helsinki Final Act to their advantage in proclaiming their dissidence and
                    organizing demonstrations, citing chapter and verse from the Helsinki Final Act
                    as their justification. It surprised us (by us, I mean the people in the
                    government at the time). Many other people also were amazed that these
                    protesters had the guts to express their views publicly, and were using this
                    supposed “sellout” document, or “the new Yalta” document, to buttress their
                    displays of dissidence.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, well, I mean the Helsinki Accords, you know, might have been almost the
                    straw that broke the Soviet camel's back. I mean it was, basically, a complete
                    failure of the system, particularly economically, and in other ways too. But I
                    mean this allowed movements to happen that probably wouldn't have happened if
                    they hadn't.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I guess Helsinki encouraged some dissidents; and some of their
                    leaders were smart enough to cite the freedoms the Soviets had signed up to
                    permit, to hold up these standards either when the local regimes tried to
                    suppress them and their movements, or when the Soviets cracked down. So I think
                    Helsinki actually contributed to the stirrings in Eastern Europe and in the
                    Soviet Union itself, but in Eastern Europe in particular. The dam finally broke
                    in 1989 on the Hungarian-Austrian border and in Poland, and then in East Germany
                    itself.</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: Many factors were involved there, but I think it may well be that
                    the Helsinki Accords were, at least in part, a contributor to these
                    movements.</p>

                        did that affect you, I mean, in dealing with your particular area, which was
                        relations with the Soviets, and their thing? I mean, although it wasn't
                        direct, I mean, this was a real setback for the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, it certainly was a major setback: the pictures of our
                    helicopters leaving from the roof of the American Embassy in Saigon, and then,
                    after our withdrawal, the collapse of the South Vietnamese regime and the
                    takeover by the North. We also worried about our POWs (Prisoners of War). Many
                    of them, I guess all those that we knew about, eventually came home alive. Those
                    who had died in captivity were turned over by the North Vietnamese as well, but
                    many MIAs (missing in action) were never traced.</p>
                <p>The expectation (which went back to the Eisenhower administration and the
                    “domino” theory), that such a collapse would produce a wider effect in the
                    region and would undermine the whole American position in Southeast Asia and
                    adjacent areas, turned out not to be the case. In fact, in Indonesia - this is
                    still a controversial issue - in Indonesia, there was a mass onslaught against
                    the Communists. Indonesia had been one of the places that we worried about in
                    case of Vietnam falling, as was Thailand. Well, as it turned out, those
                    countries really didn't fall to the Communists, despite the pain and agony in
                    this country and on the part of the South Vietnamese, and the troubles in Laos
                    and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>The other thing that's worth pointing out is that, before the collapse of the
                    American effort, Vietnam had already become a major source of dispute between
                    China and the Soviet Union. This was revealed in various ways. Many other
                    factors contributed to the split between the Chinese and the Soviets, starting
                    in the late '50s; it was probably beneath the surface well before that. But
                    Vietnam became a particular apple of discord.</p>
                <p>We had had the impression for quite a while that the Soviets were looking for
                    some way for the Vietnam war to end. Of course, they wanted it to end on
                    favorable terms to themselves (i.e., with the people that they had backed being
                    the victors). But they were starting to back away from their large-scale support
                    of the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong. In 1972, they were looking for some
                    degree of what came to be known as “detente.” We had bombed Haiphong and Hanoi
                    just before the scheduled summit meeting between Nixon and Brezhnev in May of
                    1972; and there was some expectation that the Soviets might cancel the summit on
                    account of the bombing, because we had hit a Soviet ship in the harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kosygin was there, I believe.</hi>

                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Even so, it turned out that they didn't cancel. Nixon didn't think
                    they would, but we had prepared statements and taken other precautions in case
                    they canceled the summit meeting. Some discussions at the summit meeting, which
                    were very nasty, would seem to have been mostly for the record. Of course, the
                    Soviets were eager to have economic relations with us, and they pulled a fast
                    one on us in persuading us of their alleged shortages of wheat. [end of
                    tape]</p>
                <p>They are interested in economic relations; they wanted MFN [Most Favored Nations]
                    treatment; and they wanted access to our government credit institutions,
                    including the Export-Import Bank. They were also interested in arms control
                    treaties, the SALT I Agreement and the ABM Treaty. The latter is now very much
                    alive as we speak, or maybe not alive, depending on what the Bush administration
                    may be doing in the next few days.</p>
                <p>The Soviets had been through a near-war with the Chinese in 1969 - a very
                    difficult, hostile relationship involving the contest for the domination of the
                    international Communist movement and their role in the Third World, where they
                    were competing in Africa and other places. It was a very testy competition, and
                    I think the Soviets wanted some hedge, as protection, as it were, although their
                    ties to the U.S. and the West Europeans were much less extensive than what
                    developed in the post-Soviet period; but still, it was different from
                    before.</p>
                <p>Once the war in Vietnam ended, the Soviets may even have thought that the U.S.
                    had been so humiliated that they could extract all sorts of concessions from us
                    - that the U.S., just because of the loss of Vietnam, the questions that were
                    raised about U.S. reliability and strength, and our domestic upheavalthe Soviets
                    may have thought they could exploit our perceived weaknesses on the negotiating
                    front by extracting various kinds of concessions from us. That was certainly a
                    concern in some parts of the American body politic.</p>
                <p>But in fact, the end of the war in Vietnam removed an issue of contention between
                    the U.S. and the Soviets. As it turned out, even then it didn't help us very
                    much in our relations with the Soviets, because we still had major differences
                    with them in the Middle East. We almost came to blows, or may possibly have come
                    to blows, at the time of the Yom Kippur War-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '73, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: In '73. Then we began to have problems in Southern Africa, over
                    Angola. So there were plenty of issues. The arms race, the so-called arms race,
                    went on merrily, despite the arms control agreements; and the numbers of nuclear
                    warheads increased astronomically on both sides after the 1972 SALT treaty. So
                    we had plenty of problems. Vietnam, in any case, was no longer an apple of
                    discord.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>Not surprisingly, the fact that we were also cultivating relations with the
                    Chinese is one of the reasons why the Soviets, I think, had incentives to have
                    dealings with us. The Chinese, of course, because of their long-standing
                    problems with the Vietnamese, eventually invaded North Vietnam and bloodied
                    their noses. So it was a complicated-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -game. But in any event, essentially, Vietnam was no longer on the
                    U.S.-Soviet agenda in the mid-seventies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, from your perspective, was there almost a
                        feeling of a certain amount of relief that you got rid of this thing because
                        you no longer were having to, [sigh] you know, always keep this war in mind?
                        I mean this allowed you more room to maneuver in, and it was no longer this
                        bone of contention, I mean, a burr under the saddle with our relations,
                        particularly our NATO allies and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I think the greatest relief in the first instance came when it
                    became clear that there wasn't any “domino” effect from the fall of South
                    Vietnam, although there were incidents with Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But certainly there was no “domino” effect that benefitted the
                    Soviets in that part of the world. We were less sure about the Chinese; but in
                    the meantime, we had quite good relations with the Chinese, and they weren't
                    anywhere as potent militarily as the Soviets. The divisions over Vietnam here at
                    home continued even when the war was over. It certainly was a relief not to have
                    body counts and news of losses. Gradually, the acute division in the country
                    began to ebb, so in that sense it was a relief.</p>
                <p>In terms of relations with the Soviets, by the mid-1970s, we were able to deal
                    with some of the other issues and concerns that we had with them. We didn't have
                    a great breakthrough that sealed a new and amicable relationship with the Soviet
                    Union, even though we had summit meetings and lots of contacts and those famous
                    “back channels,” which helped when confrontations arose, as they did in the Yom
                    Kippur War and over some other issues. At best, we were in a phase of detente
                    with the Soviets - that is, some alleviation of tensions - but we were far from
                    having a genuinely friendly relationship. Years later, continuing suspicions and
                    tensions showed up in the Soviet attitude toward NATO and NATO enlargement, and
                    their still ever-present notion of the zero-sum game: that whenever they lost
                    something, we must gain; and our own idea that when the Soviets gain somewhere,
                    we must be losers.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Some of that lingers to this day. So we were a long way away from a
                    relationship of amity. We shared some common interests in preventing, or trying
                    to prevent, a nuclear war. This gave rise to various contacts between the U.S.
                    and the Soviets, and some care in how we handled our weapons so that we didn't
                    appear as if we were getting ready to jump them, and vice-versa. Vietnam had
                    been a major irritant, perhaps even a potential cause of a clash between the
                    U.S. and the Soviets. Vietnam was viewed here as an example of the Soviets
                    becoming a global power of sorts, because it's pretty remote from the USSR, and
                    they had a base in Cam Ranh Bay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I'm now talking from hindsight of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
                    It wasn't that evident in 1976-77 that it was going to collapse the way it did
                    only a dozen years later. I think maybe the mid-to-late '70s was about the
                    zenith of Soviet power and influence. It gradually ebbed in the '80s, until the
                    USSR did collapse in the late '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did we think the Soviets were up to in Africa
                        during the time you were Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: The Soviets had become active in Africa in the 1950s, when
                    independence got underway in the formerly British and French and other colonies.
                    They saw opportunities there to establish themselves. I don't understand exactly
                    what they had in mind, because it cost them money. They tried to woo these
                    various countries. Many of the new African states had left-wing leaders, people
                    educated actually in Europe, at the London School of Economics-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -and in France at the Sorbonne or other universities. As a result,
                    they carried a lot of the European left-wing or even Communist values and
                    attitudes into Africa. The Soviets saw opportunities to increase the range of
                    their influence. It also became a bone of contention between the Soviets and the
                    Chinese-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -because the Chinese tried to portray themselves as the leader of
                    the Third World, the model for the developing world. We didn't quite realize
                    this at the time, but in fact, one of the reasons for both Soviet and Chinese
                    activities had to do with their competition. To some extent, this came at our
                    expense, to the extent that we lost ground and confronted increasing strategic
                    ramifications of the Sino-Soviet rivalries. For example, the Soviets established
                    some intelligence activities and listening posts in Angola in order to intercept
                    our naval messages and other communications. That was a military problem. But it
                    looked like they were also encouraging the Cubans to become active in East
                    Africa and then in-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Ethiopia particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, and then in southwestern Africa. It looked very much as though
                    the Soviets were using the Cubans, or encouraging the Cubans, as part of their
                    own effort to establish themselves, and perhaps to establish bases and
                    facilities for their naval activities. Maybe this was in anticipation of the
                    collapse of the South African regime (which didn't really happen until much
                    later), but they were interested in the gold mines and various other assets.
                    There were all sorts of theories, including the idea that the Soviets also
                    wanted to threaten the trade routes around the Cape of Good Hope. There were
                    maps that showed-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oil particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -oil in particular, but other trade as well, which they might affect
                    by having some naval facilities. Speculation as to Soviet intentions became a
                    kind of a cottage industry in various think-tanks. Most observers felt that the
                    activities showed the continuing Sino-Soviet threat, although as I say, it was
                    in fact mostly a competition between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Obviously, we were worried about CIA and other reports about Soviet
                    activities. In the last few meetings we had with the Soviets during the Ford
                    administration, in 1976, we did raise, in particular, the Angolan issues and the
                    Cuban presence in Angola.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>For some reason I'd become something of a target for Brezhnev's jokes. There was
                    a press conference when Kissinger was there with a bunch of us in early 1976, to
                    make a final stab at getting a second strategic arms limitation agreement. A
                    little press conference was held before our meeting began in Brezhnev's office
                    in the Kremlin. One of the questions from the American press was, “what about
                    the Cubans in Angola? Are you going to discuss that?” And Brezhnev said, “That's
                    not our business. Ask Sonnenfeldt, and he'll give you an answer. But it's
                    nothing that we have anything to do with.”</p>
                <p>Well, we did try to discuss this, and we did have some exchanges with them
                    because it worried us. After all, we had lots of problems with the Cubans. We
                    didn't particularly care to see the Cubans becoming an imperial power in Black
                    Africa, using their own blacks and their black antecedents as a way of carrying
                    their role and their system into formerly-colonial Africa. Angola, of course,
                    had been under the Portuguese; and it was in rebellion for a long time. Then
                    there was a rebellion against the rebellion. The conflict is still going on.</p>
                <p>The Soviet and Soviet-sponsored Cuban actions in Africa fit into our general
                    world view that the Soviets were an emerging global power, and that parts of
                    Africa had become a place where they were going to assert their presence and
                    extend their strategic challenge to the United States. In West Africa and the
                    former French areas, such as Guinea and Mali, there were some Communists or
                    pseudo-Communists in power; and then Angola; and in South Africa, the ANC
                    (African National Congress) was heavily Communist; then Ethiopia; but Somalia,
                    on the coast, was strategic. (The former Belgian Congo had been a problem with
                    the Soviets for us in 1960. But it was less so in the 1970s, although its
                    difficulties remained substantial.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somalia, right on the Red Sea, controlled the Red Sea
                        access.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right. This led to some competitive arms deals over time
                    between the U.S. and the Soviets. The Soviets started it, and we countered it
                    later in the early '90s in Somalia. So it was a general concern.</p>
                <p>Of course, when we tried to raise this in some formal fashion, the Soviets took
                    the position that as far as the Cubans were concerned, that was Cuban business;
                    and whatever they were doing was just economic, helping with road building, and
                    so on. So we didn't get very far on this subject in the waning days of thFord
                    administration, but it was a concern for us; and the fact that the Cubans were
                    involved merely made the neuralgic issue of Cuba that much more neuralgic,
                    because they weren't just confining themselves to their home island.</p>

                    Soviets, wanted protection from the Soviets. They were still chafing from what
                    had happened in the 1962 missile crisis. In this view, what the Cubans were
                    doing was consistent with Castro's own sense of mission and of his role in the
                    world as a liberator.</p>
                <p>But I suppose a majority of people, myself included, didn't exactly see Castro as
                    a surrogate for the Soviets, but rather as doing the Soviet's bidding in
                    exchange for whatever it was he was getting - protection, military protection
                    for one thing. So we really saw this Cuban activism as part of the general
                    Soviet expansionism in the global arena. At the same time, I think we all
                    understood that there were frictions now and then between the Soviets and the
                    Cubans, and that the Soviets were not keen on letting anyone, including the
                    Cubans, drag them into a conflict with us, or into a conflict that they weren't
                    interested in getting dragged into. So we figured that, while there was some
                    mutual support, there must also be some friction. I guess CIA and others had
                    some evidence of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the Soviets, either through Cuba or on their
                        own, doing much in Latin America, or was this sort of a self sealing area
                        against the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, we were alert to it. There were some Soviet efforts to sell
                    arms in central and South America, and there were some Communist or
                    pseudo-Communist groups. We had problems in Chile with left-leaning regimes, and
                    that caused other problems in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Allende, and the overthrow of Allende-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right, and we'd had problems in Guatemala in the 1950s. The Cubans
                    were active, and Che Guevara was rallying an anti-American revolutionary
                    movement. But I must confess, I haven't thought about this and looked back.
                    Latin America had lots of problems. The Soviet aspect of it was more of a
                    potential threat than a real day-to-day worry, as it was in the Middle East and,
                    to some extent, in parts of Africa. We were alert to manifestations of Soviet
                    interest, and then Soviet involvement. There were occasional trips back and
                    forth between Latin American leaders and Soviet figures. We assumed that the
                    Cubans were instrumental in some of this. But the Cubans weren't that popular in
                    Latin America in general, although they had their sympathizers. Of course, they
                    had been excluded from the Inter-American system; and there were many sanctions
                    in place, which were somewhat controversial - not quite as controversial then as
                    they became more than 20 years later in the Helms-Burton Act [Cuban Liberty and
                    Democratic Solidarity Act].</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>But Latin America, as far as the Soviet angles or the Chinese angles were
                    concerned, was more a worry that needed to be watched than a worry that was
                    concrete and posed direct and identifiable threats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that, I mean, sitting there looking, I mean
                        you're sort of one of the point people dealing with the “Soviet menace.” Did
                        you find that sort of our posts abroad and all were using the Soviet menace
                        in Pago Pago to get whatever they wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, did you have to sort of deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I didn't. First of all, annual reports were required about
                    Communism and, I think it was still called “Sino-Soviet activities,” in lots of
                    countries around the world, including Latin America. So this stuff kept coming
                    in over time. I did not deal with possible exploitation by local American
                    organizations, including embassies. I think maybe some people in some posts may
                    have tried to exploit these concerns for their own benefits. I didn't deal with
                    that. It wasn't my particular responsibility. I guess it was the Under Secretary
                    for Political Affairs in the State Department (Joe Sisco, for part of my time)
                    and others who were watching this. Maybe we had conversations about what the
                    Soviets were up to in Latin America; and there was an occasional NIE (National
                    Intelligence Estimate), either on a particular country problem or on the region
                    as a whole. I suppose the Soviet activities figured in some of the decisions
                    that were being made on AID (Agency for International Development) programs and
                    military-to-military relations with the Latin Americans. The U.S. had an
                    Inter-American Defense College here at Fort McNair, and there were contacts
                    between the militaries. I got invited a couple of times to the college at Fort
                    McNair to talk about what the Soviets were up to in the hemisphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I was always a bit embarrassed because I couldn't think of anything
                    terribly exciting to say. The colonels and naval captains and others from these
                    Latin American countries knew much more about it than I did at the time. But I
                    tried to talk in a learned fashion about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>I did hold a general view, and I spoke and wrote about it a bit after I left the
                    government: that the Soviets really weren't great imperialists. First of all,
                    they were racists; and secondly, what they had to offer to these countries
                    didn't really compete with what the West had to offer in terms of material
                    benefits, the quality of technology, and so on. They were encouraging the
                    emergence of old-fashioned industrial facilities-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Steel mills-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And stadiums.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. They built or sponsored eye-catching projects like steel
                    mills and a huge reservoir on the Nile in Africa, and stadiums and things of
                    that sort. They set up schools and colleges in the Soviet Union for students
                    from former colonial areas. Some of this effort backfired when the Russians
                    peoples' inherent racism showed up in often tense relations between Africans and
                    Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Lumumba University did probably more for our cause
                        than [laughter].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. When they were in those various countries, the Soviets usually
                    stuck to themselves. I guess some of them learned the language of the country
                    and did intermingle; but generally, compared to the British and others, they
                    never struck me as a particularly competent group of imperialists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is something, you know, talking to people who've

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they didn't seem to really get out. I mean there
                        wasn't the sort of a rapport that? wasn't perfect but we saw of the
                        Americans, British, and the French, you know, who're, you know, more
                        comfortable in this atmosphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, when places like Togo and the Cameroons and Namibia and
                    Tanganyika became independent states, they still had buildings that the Germans
                    had built before 1914; and there were still people who spoke German from
                    pre-World War I. I don't know whether the Soviets have left much of anything
                    behind. The Aswan Dam is still standing, but it hasn't brought great benefits in
                    Egypt. The British, of course, left language and institutions, as well as
                    physical properties.</p>
                <p>Q: And the French have maintained their culture. Many Africans still look upon
                    France as being home, I mean, the seat of culture, and all that.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Of course, the Soviets weren't in Africa for a very long time, and
                    they weren't, strictly speaking, running colonies the way the British, French
                    and Germans had in Africa. But they didn't bring culture with them either, as
                    the Spanish and the Portuguese did in the Western Hemisphere and in Latin
                    America. So this was a rather shallow form of expansionism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in the Middle East, despite the left-wing governments
                        and all, there seems to be within the sort of the Islamic world a natural
                        repulsion of the Soviets. I mean -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, the Soviets mistreated their own Muslims. Also, the Soviets
                    ran away several times when conflict loomed in the Middle East in various
                    Israeli wars, but especially if we were in the picture! They didn't support
                    their clients when they really got into trouble. That gradually sank in, and the
                    Soviets really came to be seen as rather unreliable allies in the MiddlEast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also their equipment wasn't very good either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's true, of course, especially when compared to the Israelis'
                    and then later on, to ours in the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>To sum up, as far as my concerns as Counselor re Soviet actions in the western
                    hemisphere: Cuba was the main concern that we had, because the Soviets were
                    flying their airplanes up and down our coastline; we'd had a serious missile
                    crisis in 1962; and we knew that Soviet forces were still in Cuba, running
                    intelligence operations, and so on. There were a few people who worried about
                    the vulnerabilities of the Panama Canal. That concern goes back to even before
                    it was dug, and does not relate specifically to the Soviets, but in general as a
                    major strategic asset of the United States. But then Latin America wasn't really
                    very much on my official radar screen; it was more in the Inter-American Affairs
                    Bureau that dealt with these matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something that came up, I believe during the Carter
                        administration, was all of a sudden the discovery of the “Soviet brigade” in
                        Cuba. Now, I mean, you were saying, I mean, this was sort of almost a made
                        up issue, wasn't it? I mean we knew there were Soviet troops there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. The Soviet troops were supposed to have been taken out at the
                    time of the missile crisis, certainly the ones connected with the missile
                    deployments. But we did know that some Soviet forces remained there, and we knew
                    that, for the Red Army, this was a great place to serve. It was warm, and there
                    were great beaches, and so on. Soviet diplomats liked it, even though it wasn't
                    all that pleasant, specifically in Havana; but they liked the life style down
                    there. So yes, we had a general sense of what they were doing there militarily.
                    I can't remember why it blew up in the Carter time, because I had left the
                    government. We did have a few episodes which were challenging. For example, in
                    1970 they put a submarine tender down there; we noticed it and thought it
                    violated the understandings going back to the missile crisis. And as I said,
                    they kept flying reconnaissance flights off our east coast-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bears.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Bears down our coastline, which we tracked carefully. Sometimes I
                    think they even notified us that they were going to do it. Occasionally there
                    were some visits by Soviet naval vessels. But in Latin America, in general, as
                    I've been saying: it was a concern; we watched it. But I don't think we really
                    had any very specific, explicit, concrete problems that at least reached my
                    attention. Maybe the people in the Latin American Bureau talked to Kissinger
                    about it, or to the Under Secretary or Deputy Secretary, but I just didn't
                    figure in that area, except to keep informed.</p>
                <p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is January 17, 2002. Hal, let's talk about the election of '76. Carter was
                    in; Ford was out. Let's talk about the transition first. How did that work for
                    you?</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, it was very clear as soon as the election results were in that
                    there would be a different team at the State Department. For years, I had told
                    my wife that I planned to leave the government when I was 50, which would be in
                    1976. So I had, actually, long considered leaving the government at age 50,
                    regardless of the outcome of the election. In fact, it would have been more
                    difficult for me to leave if Ford had won, because the pressures for keeping
                    things in place would have been considerable.</p>
                <p>But anyway, I thought I'd had a very good career, despite some handicaps and bad
                    moments. All in all, it was something that was extraordinary, when you consider
                    that I grew up in Germany in a remote rural town, and all the other aspects of
                    my earlier life. The decision to leave after the election was easy for me,
                    because I thought a lot of people were going to come in with whom I'd had some
                    policy differences in the past and probably would have in the future. In any
                    case, as regards a serious senior job, they would have no particular obligation
                    to me. I was a career Foreign Service Officer and a Career Minister, so I guess
                    I could have stood on my rights to have some job; but, as these things normally
                    go, I would just be walking the corridors of the State Department, with no
                    meaningful role. So I was really prepared to leave, and I started making some
                    arrangements.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>May I also say that I decided very early on that I did not want to get into
                    another large organization, government or private. I didn't want to remain
                    enmeshed in bureaucracies and bureaucratic politics. So my idea from the start
                    was that I'd like to have a home base in one of the research outfits around
                    town. I wanted to stay in Washington, and my wife had her ties here. So I hoped
                    to get a place to hang my hat in one of the think-tanks around town, but then
                    also put together some kind of a consulting business. In the mid-'70s, a lot of
                    companies had somehow burnt their fingers at one place or another around the
                    world because of crises that they hadn't anticipated, and they were having legal
                    problems and stockholder problems, and so on. Many of them were eager to at
                    least make a record of having diligently inquired into situations where they
                    were involved financially. It became a rather major activity in the American
                    business community, either to set up an intelligence shop or a political-risk
                    shop within a large company, or for regional experts and technical specialists
                    to get together and form consulting outfits specializing in political risk, as
                    it was called in those days. I thought that would be something I'd like to do. I
                    needed money, because I had three kids heading for college, and I had been stuck
                    in a government salary freeze for several years. Even though I was at the top of
                    the pay scale, my salary had been frozen at $38,000 for more than four years (a
                    substantial government pay-raise came into effect on March 1, 1977, just a week
                    before I retired).</p>
                <p>It took a while, as it usually does, for the Secretary of State to be designated,
                    and then for the Secretary of State and the incoming White House to decide on
                    the rest of the senior staff. Cy Vance, who just died a few days ago, was named
                    Secretary of State, and Warren Christopher as Deputy Secretary. I knew both of
                    them, Cy better than Chris. I knew that I would have disagreements with Cy on
                    policy grounds, but I had a lot respect for him. Then it took some weeks for
                    them to get around to designating others. I saw Vance early, before he'd been
                    confirmed. We met at the transition office; and we chatted about things that I
                    had been doing. Of course, he knew Henry as well.</p>
                <p>He said to me, “Well, you understand that I'm going to choose my own Counselor,”
                    and he actually gave me the name, Matthew Nimetz, whom he knew well from New
                    York through his legal work and otherwise. I didn't know Nimetz. “But,” Vance
                    said to me, “if you have any thoughts for a position, let me know; but you know
                    I can't guarantee that you would get a job anywhere near as significant as the
                    one that you have now, because of the change of administration.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, I understand.” And that sort of eased the situation.</p>
                <p>He did say that “I'd like to be able to call on you,” and that, in the case of
                    Vance, was probably meant seriously, and not just a formality of the new boss
                    showing you the way out.</p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, maybe it'd be helpful, at least for a while, for continuity and
                    effective transition, to make an arrangement like that.” So I stayed in the
                    Counselor's office, as the Ford administration was still in office, and we still
                    had some things going. But I began to get my papers and materials ready for
                    storage. I didn't want to take any of them with me or give them to some
                    institution. I got letters from my university, from the Library of Congress, and
                    from others who were eager to have my papers; but I thought it would be cleaner
                    and simpler to just leave them with the Department. But I went through some of
                    this material. I didn't take anything out, but I tried to organize it so that
                    the new people could refer to it. I went about my business until perhaps the
                    middle of December, 1976, when some of the new people began to show up; the
                    transition team was there as well. We were waiting for them to come along, and
                    it was a relatively smooth transition.</p>
                <p>What I most deeply regretted, and there continued to be reverberations, was the
                    so-called “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine” that had caused Ford to get tripped up in the
                    second debate with Carter on policy toward Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you mention this to Cyrus Vance? I was just saying
                        that, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't even remember what I mentioned to Vance. I think I chatted
                    with him about it at a meeting in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations,
                    before he was picked to be Secretary of State. I certainly mentioned it to Ford
                    when I ran into him here or there, and in subsequent years also. And he always
                    said, “stop! You know, you don't have to worry about that! What I said in that
                    debate was my judgment, my call, and you shouldn't have any feeling of guilt or
                    remorse. It's just the way things happened.”</p>
                <p>But I don't think I talked to Vance about it, or he to me, once the transition
                    got underway. I'm not even sure that he paid a whole lot of attention to it at
                    the time.</p>
                <p>Gradually, the new people got named. I knew many of those who were coming in;
                    some I didn't know. And we began the process of talking about issues in which
                    I'd been involved. Some of those people, like Matt Nimetz, had not really been
                    involved too much in the details of foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He was a lawyer, but also quite interested in international issues.
                    I frankly don't know the details, other than his law practice in New York. I
                    think he was active in the Council on Foreign Relations. Fred Bergsten, who had
                    been on the NSC staff with me in the Kissinger years, a hotshot and young,
                    bright guy, was nominated as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for
                    International Affairs. He came to see me because I had been very much involved,
                    in 1975, in setting up what came to be known later as the G-7 summit meetings. I
                    had been what later came to be known as a “Sherpa,” (the experts chosen to
                    shepherd and coordinate preparations for the summit meetings), and Bergsten
                    figured that he would be doing that at Treasury. So we talked about the origins
                    of the G-7 and what kind of things we did. I also talked during this period with
                    Les Gelb, who was going to head P(Bureau of Political-Military Affairs).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Called Political-Military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. We talked mostly about arms control, especially nuclear
                    proliferation and the stalled SALT negotiations. And I'm sure there were others
                    I saw in the transition; I just can't recall.</p>
                <p>Q: I just want to?but for somebody doing this, so they won't have to do too much
                    research, you may have seen Sherpa, S-H-E-R-P-A, which was a term used for those
                    who facilitated our leaders going to the summit - Taken from the Nepalese
                    climbers.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I don't know where it came from, whether it was even an
                    American-invented phrase; but in any case, we didn't use it in 1975 and 1976. I
                    think it came into use in the Carter administration.</p>
                <p>Of course, these meetings would have to be pre-cooked to some extent, although I
                    have to say that the original idea was that it should be more spontaneous among
                    the principals. (I can't remember now whether we've talked about this in the
                    past). It started with informal discussions among Giscard d'Estaing, Schmidt,
                    Wilson and then Callaghan, Ford, and Kissinger and his counterparts. The
                    Japanese were always expected to be part of it because of their economic and
                    financial role, but they weren't really that much involved in the original
                    planning. Normally, the bureaucracy doesn't really trust the political leaders
                    with making important decisions, so they negotiate draft statements for the
                    leaders to approve at the end, maybe leaving out a few details so the heads of
                    government can say they count - but we really wanted this to be an open-ended
                    discussion forum where the leaders could deal with serious issues. And that's
                    more or less what developed, although not so much in the very first session in
                    1975.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>In any event, it became clear very quickly during the transition that the Carter
                    people were inclined to adopt a more structured arrangement than we had favored
                    for this rather important and innovative institution. It was somewhat like de
                    Gaulle's idea for a “Directoire” (board of directors), a world forum of the
                    leaders of wealthy and powerful countries, which we had sneered at years
                    earlier. So there was a lot of interest in that during the transition. Relations
                    with the Soviets, of course, were still very much on the agenda; and some NATO
                    issues and other concerns. I talked as freely as I could with my successors.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I was wondering, the National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who
                    had very decided views on relations with the Soviet Union, and you, had been
                    sort of the Soviet Union man for some time, off and on. Could you talk a little
                    about how you saw him and his, I mean, before he came on?</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, I had known Zbig for a long time, even from his Harvard days,
                    and then when he was at Columbia, and then at various study groups. He had been
                    in the State Department in the '60s, as a Council on Foreign Relations Fellow, I
                    think. In any case, he worked quite closely then with Under Secretary George
                    Ball, who used him as a brain-trust and an idea-man for speeches. I actually
                    worked directly with Zbig in 1967, when NATO was going through one of its
                    periodic reviews of its role, and what needed to be improved or changed or
                    adapted. Bureaucratically, this was an EUR (European Bureau) function. I was
                    still in INR when the NATO review came along, but I'd been very much involved
                    with the European Bureau and Under Secretary Gene Rosto(not Walt Rostow, but his
                    brother, Eugene Rostow, a law professor from Yale).</p>
                <p>NATO set up a special group to look at its future roles. It was called the Harmel
                    Study, named for the Belgian Foreign Minister at the time. Brzezinski very much
                    wanted to be the American representative, but the European Bureau just couldn't
                    accept that; they had their problems with Zbig. So the compromise was that
                    Brzezinski and I would be the two political “commissars,” as I said at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you considered counterweights, more or less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, for some reason, the European Bureau couldn't get one of their
                    own people to lead this project, which would have been the appropriate
                    bureaucratic way of doing it; and Brzezinski wanted it, so it got to be a
                    bureaucratic hand-wrestle. Then EUR asked me if I would do it, and they worked
                    it out with the head of my Bureau, INR. So Zbig and I were sort of co-leaders of
                    this effort, and we went to Europe several times for meetings. Incidentally,
                    this was at the time when NATO was moving its headquarters from Paris to
                    Brussels; so we started in Paris, and ended up the discussions in Brussels. Zbig
                    and I worked together really quite closely and very well. In most respects, we
                    saw eye-to-eye, as we had in our earlier contacts before he joined the State
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>My main problem with Zbig was that he was a very successful publicist. In
                    addition to being a serious academic, he was very articulate and fluent. He'd
                    already published two or three books and lots of articles, and he was very much
                    in the swing of things. In those days, I thought Zbig seemed to feel that when
                    he had articulated an issue and recommended a policy, that was it; and he didn't
                    really know very much at that time about turning ideas into policies. He knows a
                    lot more now, after years in government, but at the time, he seemed to think
                    that you had a policy when he had enunciated it, and the rest of it was just
                    sort of an automatic follow-through. I don't think he ever really worked in the
                    endless drafting sessions at NATO, where usually you got the British, who were
                    the most fluent writers, to do the first drafts, and then everyone haggled over
                    words and commas. But apart from that, on the substantive issues, I think we
                    worked well together on the Harmel study. I think he returned to Columbia before
                    it was completed.</p>
                <p>When Zbig became National Security Adviser in 1977, he'd been instrumental in
                    getting Carter to run for President. They had met at the Trilateral Commission.
                    Zbig and others, including Dick Gardner (who became Carter's Ambassador to
                    Italy), were pushing Carter to run. It was almost a foregone conclusion that
                    Zbig would end up as Carter's National Security Advisor, and I think we had
                    several conversations during the campaign and the transition. I saw him in
                    subsequent years from time to time-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time when he was going to be there, did you have
                        any sort of misgivings about his thrust towards the Soviet Union as a
                        whole?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, I really didn't have any problems with his approach. We were
                    both pretty hard-line. Relations with the Soviet Union hadn't gone all that well
                    in the last year of the Ford administration. Zbig and Cy Vance had their
                    differences. I couldn't tell about Warren Christopher, because I had no idea
                    what his views were (he'd been in the Justice Department in the Johnson
                    administration); but I expected that Zbig and Vance would come at issues from
                    different vantage points. I had no notion about Carter. All I knew is that he
                    sounded tough as nails on Eastern Europe, as he exploited the controversy about
                    the “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine” in the campaign. But apart from that, I had no idea
                    where he would stand. No, I had no problems with Zbig's overall approach. I
                    might have had a specific problem with a concrete formulation, but all in all, I
                    didn't have any big problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this transition moved towards January 20, 1977, what
                        did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, Nimetz hadn't been confirmed by January 21. So I guess Vance
                    or somebody asked me if I could just stick around for a few more weeks until
                    Matt Nimetz would come in. There was a gradual turnover in the appointive
                    offices; some people were retained. So I stayed in the Counselor's office for a
                    couple of weeks after the inauguration. Nimetz came down to Washington a few
                    times, but I guess it wasn't appropriate for him to sit in that office until he
                    was confirmed by the Senate.</p>
                <p>In any event, the State Department Secretariat had several offices for outgoing
                    political appointees (which I was at the time, even though I was a career guy),
                    where I could sit while I put my affairs in order and did all the required paper
                    work. So after a couple of weeks, I left my nice wood-paneled offices in the
                    Counselor's suite and went around the corner to one of the Secretariat's
                    offices. I can't remember whether my secretary stayed with me (she was going to
                    retire), or whether they assigned someone to me. I was basically getting files
                    cleaned up and ready for storage, and putting down some last-minute thoughts. At
                    that point, since it was clear that I was leaving, I felt there was nothing
                    wrong with my trying to put together a bit of my after-life.</p>
                <p>Q: No.</p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: I'd actually had some calls from a couple of Wall Street firms,
                    asking me whether I'd be interested in doing political-risk work. So things were
                    beginning to take some shape. You know, if you've worked only very briefly in
                    the outside (non-government) world, you wonder how that is going to work out. It
                    turned out that I received a whole bunch of invitations to give talks. RAND
                    asked me to come out to California as soon as I left the Department, to have a
                    one-week de-brief of my experiences in the government, especially my contacts
                    with the Soviet Union. So it didn't look like I would be stepping into some sort
                    of a vacuum, but that I would be quite active, right off the bat.</p>
                <p>So it was a mixture of just winding up, helping new appointees who were getting
                    started if they wanted to know about particular issues, and looking ahead.</p>
                <p>In addition, almost immediately, people started asking me to either do interviews
                    or write papers about Kissinger, and I said, “No.” For instance, a French
                    publishing house wanted me to write a book in English, which they wanted to be
                    the first to publish in French, about what it was like to work and live with
                    Kissinger; and I said, “No thanks, I'm not writing a kiss-and-tell.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense, you know as time moved on, I think one of
                        the things that strikes me and please correct me if I'm wrong, but sort of
                        the move of the Republican party, I mean, sort of the major power of the
                        Republican Party over towards the right wing, more do-it-alone, not quite
                        isolationist, but I mean it's almost like it kind of reverted back to the
                        '30s or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, I don't think so, although there may have been some people who
                    felt like that. Dean Rusk had at various times, during the Vietnam War and on
                    other occasions, expressed his concern about a reversion to isolationism,
                    especially because of our experience in Vietnam. But many Republicans, if you'd
                    stop to think about it, sounded much more interventionist than Carter and Vance,
                    if not Brzezinski. I couldn't tell about Harold Brown, the Defense Secretary,
                    although I'd known him quite well. And the Republicans tended to be tougher on
                    the Soviets, at least rhetorically, and also in legislation. Many of them were
                    strong on NATO. No, I think the fault-line, if there was one, between some
                    liberal Republicans and more hard-line Republicans didn't relate so much to
                    isolationism, or to unilateralism versus involvement, engagement, and
                    multilateralism. I think it had to do more with being tough on the Soviets. Of
                    course, we were out of Vietnam by then, but we had some open issues with the
                    Soviets: their intervention in Angola was still a problem, and we were still in
                    the aftermath of Vietnam; the Soviets remained in Cuba, in the Middle East and
                    beyond.</p>
                <p>Some Republicans on the far right had been critical of Nixon's opening to China,
                    but it was not a serious problem for Nixon and Kissinger. There were Republicans
                    who worried about too much detente and not enough attention to threats and
                    dangers from the Soviets. Some Republicans thought there had been too severe
                    cuts in defense budgets, which were due mostly to congressional actions. But I
                    think it would be a stretch at this point to think of them as isolationists.
                    When you looked at Reagan and listened to Reagan, who clearly was very much in
                    the running - he had given Ford a big battle in the 1976 primary, and he clearly
                    had ambitions to come back the next time - there was, I guess, what one might
                    call a certain strain of unilateralism, but not isolationism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. What about within the Republican ranks? I'm
                        stressing the Republican side only because...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -because I'm a Democrat! And was a registered Democrat all along! So
                    I wasn't a card-carrying Republican. Incidentally, during the Ford
                    administration, the “Committee on the Present Danger” (meaning, the Soviets) was
                    set up by Democrats who worried about our security situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, but I was wondering whether you felt that within
                        the, you know, having lost in elections, you know, this always, there's a
                        lot of bitterness within the party. Was there a lot? Did this give rise to a
                        lot of sort of anti-Kissingerism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, in some places, it may have. On the other hand, Kissinger had
                    been a star as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He set up his own consulting company and was very successful. I
                    remember one time, perhaps a year or more after we had left office, we'd been
                    together at some meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. We
                    walked down Park Avenue after the meeting was over, and suddenly people started
                    gathering around us. “There he is! There he is!” People were coming to the
                    windows and looking out to see who was walking past. I thought to myself, “my
                    God!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: He had become something of a popular hero. He did a few TV shows,
                    which didn't turn out to get very good reviews; but there were two sources of
                    criticism of Kissinger. One was people from the more conservative wing of the
                    Republican Party, who were critical of Kissinger and particularly his policies
                    on the Soviet Union or China, and maybe some other things as well; and on the
                    other side of the spectrum, those who condemned his human rights record. They
                    were mostly, but not exclusively, from the liberal wing of the Democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So there was a certain amount of muckraking, going through some past
                    decisions on human rights and human rights-related issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Chile, I'm sure it came up, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, Chile usually came up fairly quickly. Then, of course, we were
                    in a new era of freedom of information, so documents began to be released, and
                    there were questions about what Kissinger was doing with his own documents, and
                    so on. He had imposed restrictions on access to his papers; he obviously wanted
                    them to write his own memoirs. All in all, he already was famous, and he became
                    an even more famous figure in American public life, and remains so to this day,
                    which is absolutely astonishing! And he remains a star around much of the world.
                    That's also remarkable, unique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. It really is!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No other Secretary of State remained so prominent, unless you take
                    Jefferson, who of course became President after he was Secretary of State. I
                    think it's quite an extraordinary thing, how Henry became a public figure, and
                    also a popular figure, among people who probably didn't understand most of the
                    things that he philosophized about. Still, there was something there, some
                    charisma, in addition to his obvious brilliance and sense of humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some stardom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. Of course, being a star made him a target as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Some people thought taking on Kissinger was a heroic act. We see it
                    to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Well now, as far as you're concerned, we're talking
                        right now in the Brookings Institution. Did you gravitate towards this
                        rather quickly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: No, I was a Trustee of Johns Hopkins University-.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: And I had been at their School of Advanced International Studies
                    (SAIS) as a student and a part-time faculty member.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, as we noticed, your ties go right back to your
                        arrival in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes. ThSchool of Advanced International Studies was absorbed by
                    Johns Hopkins in 1950 or '51. It had originally been established by Chris Herter
                    and Paul Nitze and some others who thought the country needed such a school.
                    They had problems as an independent institution, so Hopkins took it over; and I
                    was one of the first students to come over from Baltimore to S-A-I-S, SAIS. I
                    taught there in the evenings in the 1960s, when the State Department still
                    allowed that. When I went to the White House in 1969, I just didn't have time to
                    continue teaching, but I maintained close ties with the school.</p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>When I got ready to leave the government, I talked to the Dean of SAIS, Bob
                    Osgood, who'd briefly been on the Kissinger NSC staff with us. I asked Bob
                    whether they could give me an office, which they had done in the past for
                    various senior officials leaving government service. They'd given Dean Rusk an
                    office when no one would toucRusk when he left office in 1969 (it was really a
                    sad and disgusting thing, how he was ostracized). Osgood agreed to do that, so I
                    went to Johns Hopkins, to SAIS for my first year in private life. I had hired an
                    assistant and wanted to get my footing, to have a base where people could reach
                    me and where I could do some writing. But I also felt that, because I was a
                    long-time Trustee of Johns Hopkins, I shouldn't use the university's facilities
                    for any extended period. Because it was all gratis, I felt there could be some
                    suggestion of a conflict of interest. I resumed teaching a course that I had
                    taught many years earlier, on Soviet foreign policy, and also taught a research
                    course for Ph.D. candidates.</p>
                <p>About halfway through that first year, I talked to the then-President of
                    Brookings, Bruce MacLaury, and asked whether it might be possible for me to
                    affiliate with Brookings, not as a staff member, but as a Guest Scholar, which
                    was a category similar to one that they had at Johns Hopkins; I guess it was
                    called Visiting Scholar at Hopkins. Within two or three days, Bruce called me
                    and said it was a great idea, he wished he'd thought of it himself. So we made
                    the arrangement for me to come over to Brookings as a Guest Scholar. I went
                    there in 1978, and have been a Guest Scholar ever since!</p>
                <p>Now Brookings had the reputation of being a “liberal” research organization, both
                    on domestic affairs and, to some extent, on foreign policy. Brookings originally
                    didn't deal with foreign policy; it began to work in that area during or after
                    World War II. I knew it was very high- caliber, and I knew a lot of people
                    there. But I wasn't exactly sure how my viewpoints and orientation would fit in
                    with the ideological preferences of most of their staff. But then, I wasn't
                    going to be on the staff; I would be on my own as a Guest Scholar, and would do
                    some things with Brookings, give some talks, and participate in various
                    Brookings activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you make money doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, the thing is, I wasn't making any money. Brookings was very
                    generous at the time: they provided an office and an assistant, and they gave me
                    a small stipend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But almost from the beginning, I began to make some money - not huge
                    amounts, but more than I had made as a government official. Within a month of my
                    leaving the government, I had three or four consulting clients in New York,
                    including an investment house of considerable repute, a bank, and another
                    financial institution. So actually, I was getting paid on a monthly or quarterly
                    basis, and I'd never seen as much money. I mean, it wasn't millions, but it was
                    certainly better than my government salary. Soon I incorporated, since my
                    accountant suggested that was best for tax and other reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: So I became Helmut Sonnenfeldt, Inc., and I still maintain the
                    corporation. That's how I made some money. It helped to have the cushion of a
                    State Department pension, and also the great advantage of office space, plus the
                    whole Brookings infrastructure (much less complex in those days than it
                    subsequently became in the computer age). The infrastructure, the library, the
                    fact that I was in the midst of people who were recognized experts in their own
                    fields all across the spectrum, really, was a terrific asset to me. Of course,
                    on many issues, I didn't know enough to have differences with their staff
                    experts, or maybe I had so little knowledge that my differences were clearly
                    biases or ideological. But it was terrific in terms of the stimulating work
                    going on at Brookings.</p>
                <p>I really felt, you know, that I had had a great government career, and I had the
                    sense of playing in history a bit when I got near the top. But that was all
                    rather narrow in scope compared with a place like Brookings, where interesting
                    things were going on all around you, and there wasn't any question of who was
                    going to get a chair at the table, everybody was invited to come and
                    participate. So it was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find the atmosphere then and perhaps now,
                        just to get a little feel for this, was collegial? In other words, if you
                        wanted to find out about Japanese economy, you could talk to somebody on
                        this without treading on their turf?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Oh, yes! There wasn't any turf warfare to speak of, because most of
                    the staff here were parts of research projects. So there really wasn't turf
                    warfare, or maybe there was, and I just didn't get it. I had also made a
                    resolution that I wasn't going to get involved in bureaucratic politics. If
                    people didn't want to invite me to something, I wasn't going to-</p>

                <p>SONNENFELDT: -pout about it. But they usually asked me to join in; in fact, I got
                    too many invitations for some things that I just couldn't do or contribute much
                    substance to. My interests were known, and I broadened them. I discovered very
                    quickly, in the consulting business in New York, that expertise on the Soviet
                    Union was all very well, but nobody had any great business interests there. The
                    oil companies had been interested, and still were. But China was beginning to
                    come up, and Japan in those days was the great behemoth of the international
                    economy. So I found very quickly that, unless I became much more familiar with
                    Chinese and Japanese and Korean affairs, and then South Asian affairs, I would
                    be behind the power curve when it came to providing useful insights to my
                    consulting clients.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, I used a few graduate students from Johns Hopkins or other
                    universities to help me prepare two-page memos for my consulting clients. I had
                    told my clients that I wasn't in a position to write them long screeds, and that
                    was long before the computer age. So I had four or five standby graduate
                    students who helped me, particularly on issues where I wasn't familiar enough to
                    bat it out myself on my typewriter. But none of that was for Brookings; that was
                    for my private business, to use at meetings or to pass on to staff people at my
                    clients' firms.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: But it did get me into a broader swing of things here at Brookings
                    and at other research centers around town. There was AEI-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Right. American Enterprise Institute; and the Center for Strategic
                    and International Studies, or CSIS, which was still part of Georgetown
                    University at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>

                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -And the Heritage Foundation and others that invited me to come to
                    their meetings. The Carnegie Endowment was then around the corner, at Dupont
                    Circle. So there wasn't a day when I was in Washington that there wasn't some
                    interesting discussion. I traveled often to New York and to the West Coast and
                    other places, and abroad. So I was busy. But Brookings was a great base. I
                    really didn't have trouble with the people identified as liberals. In some
                    cases, I guess I'm liberal myself, but I valued above all the knowledge these
                    people shared. For example, an economist named Joe Pechman, who's dead now,
                    unfortunately, had been in the government (Council of Economic Advisers) at one
                    time. He had been a leading tax expert since before World War II, and was one of
                    the great originators or designers of various aspects of the American tax
                    system. You can't find a guy like that in most places.</p>
                <p>So I had no problems with ideology, and in those days, I didn't have any
                    bureaucratic problems of a kind that you encounter in the government. There's
                    one thing, though-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also in the academic world too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: That's right. Academic politics can be very bitter and brutal. I
                    knew several members of the Brookings Board of Trustees, some of whom had been
                    Cabinet members or senior officials in the government, and I'd worked with them.
                    Some of them were politically quite conservative, compared to the general tone
                    that was attributed to Brookings. In those days, two or three of those Trustees
                    encouraged me to speak out as much as I could and to be sure to identify myself
                    with Brookings, because they didn't want Brookings to carry this image of being
                    the great liberal or even left-wing think-tank. Generally, Brookings had been
                    identified with that general end of the spectrum of opinion and attitudes, and
                    these Trustees wanted to show that Brookings was open to apostates like me. All
                    in all, I must say, it was a great way to start my outside life.</p>
                <p>Some people observed my situation from afar; and over the years, a number of
                    colleagues with whom I'd worked in the government came by and wanted to talk
                    about how to do this. They were doing okay, but they were not as positive about
                    their situations as I was. I guess the word got around somehow that I had lucked
                    out.</p>
                <p>Some people attributed this to my connection with Kissinger; but I had no
                    regular, continuing connection with Kissinger, and certainly not with his
                    business activities. That was not something I wanted to do. I'd worked closely
                    with him for eight years, and even though we had a long-standing acquaintance, I
                    wanted to be on my own. In fact, my own situation may well have been influenced
                    negatively in some cases, and positively in many others, because of my
                    connection with Kissinger in the White House and the State Department.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, in 1981 the Reagan administration took over.</p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, a very conservative group, but, you know,
                        eventually moved, as they all do, more towards the center. But was there any
                        interest in you from that administration, or were they not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, Al Haig was the first Secretary of State. Haig and I were very
                    friendly, and we still are. There had been some rather ugly maneuvering, and
                    Haig very soon had his problems in the Reagan administration on various grounds.
                    I don't recall whether he asked me whether I was interested in coming back. I
                    must have told him as soon as his appointment was announced that it was great;
                    that, as Vance had suggested, I was a consultant to the Department and still had
                    my clearances, and I'd be happy to help out with some wisdom now and then. And I
                    indeed did that, continuing as a consultant to the State Department until only
                    about six months ago (in 2001), when my State Department consulting relationship
                    finally lapsed, and the clearances along with it. However, I'm consulting at the
                    Defense Department now, as I have for years; so I still have some security
                    clearances.</p>
                <p>In any event, among the senior Reagan administration officials, Al Haig was a
                    friend; Bud McFarland at the NSC was a friend from the Kissinger NSC days; and I
                    knew several other people who came in. Paul Wolfowitz was running the transition
                    team for Haig in the State Department. I didn't know Cap Weinberger very well,
                    but I knew a lot of other people at Defense.</p>
                <p>My relationship with the Reagan administration was exactly as I wanted it: I was
                    not in the administration, but I knew a good many senior people; I had the
                    opportunity to put in my two cents-worth if I felt like it, and they had the
                    opportunity to ask me for my two cents-worth if they wanted to. I knew almost
                    all the senior people in the foreign affairs/national security area, except for
                    the President himself. I felt very good about the Reagan administration, even
                    though the damned old “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine-”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: -the “Sonnenfeldt Doctrine” had been prominent among the Reaganites'
                    arguments in their anti-Kissinger stance in the '70s. I went about my business
                    and had occasional contact with the administration, just in an advisory
                    capacity. I was happy as a clam - outside the government, but enough on the
                    inside to have a good sense of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Perle is a name that comes up. Did you have much
                        to do with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Well, we have been quite good friends for many years. He, of course,
                    had worked for Scoop Jackson (Democratic Senator Henry M. Jackson of
                    Washington), whom I knew also from earlier contacts. Jackson and the State
                    Department had had big brutal battles over Jackson-Vanik (legislation linking
                    trade benefits for the Soviets to their performance in letting Soviet Jews and
                    dissenters leave the USSR) and related issues, back in the '70s. I was involved
                    in those arguments, but it was sort of understood: Richard was working for
                    Scoop, and I was working for Henry. We haggled about various different aspects.
                    There were also some major differences between Henry and Scoop, and Richard
                    Perle, on some of the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) agreements with the
                    Soviets. So on the surface, it was a pretty hostile kind of relationship, but
                    those tensions didn't carry over into my post-government career.</p>
                <p>My wife and I had already been friendly with Richard and his wife, and we became
                    even more so, as well as with two or three other people from Jackson's staff.
                    When Perle went into the Defense Department in the Reagan administration, we had
                    a very easy and good relationship. I didn't always agree with his positions, but
                    I agreed with his positions more than I had with those of his predecessors in
                    the Carter administration; although as I say, I had a high regard for Harold
                    Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Secretary of Defens[in the Carter
                        administration].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Yes, in the Carter years.</p>
                <p>My collegial relationship with Richard Perle has continued. I'm now on the
                    Defense Policy Board, which he chairs [Perle later resigned that chairmanship].
                    This institution has existed for several decades now as an advisory panel to the
                    Secretary of Defense. Richard asked me to join it, and Don Rumsfeld (Secretary
                    of Defense) asked me to join it, so we get along very well. I don't always agree
                    with Richard's more extreme positions, and he's a very tenacious, articulate
                    person. He doesn't so much attack people, although some critics attribute that
                    to him; he stays on the issues. At least in my view, he stays on the issues. He
                    can be very polemical; he can be very tough; he's also a very shrewd
                    bureaucratic operator, which he demonstrated in the Defense Department when he
                    was Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs. So all in all, that
                    relationship was fine and is personally very good. Nowadays, Richard has become
                    controversial in some quarters, but not with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this probably is a good place to stop, don't you
                        think? Is there anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>SONNENFELDT: Only one other thing I can tell you: in the first few days after I
                    left the State Department, something got into me one night when I couldn't
                    sleep. I decided maybe I ought to write down some thoughts about my career, and
                    I went to my hunt-and-peck typewriter at about three o'clock in the morning, and
                    started writing. I tied it all to what I did on January 20, 1977, the day
                    President Ford left office and President Carter was inaugurated.</p>
                <p>The Air Force had invited me to talk to a group of their generals on January 20.
                    They didn't care about the inauguration (except for those who were actually
                    involved in the ceremony). They provided a plane to take me to an airbase in
                    Florida, to talk to them about the Soviet Union and U.S.-Soviet relations. And I
                    went to Tampa and spent Inauguration day with them, watching the ceremony on
                    television, giving my talk and having good discussions about how to deal with
                    the Soviet Union. Then I flew back to Washington on this little plane later in
                    the evening, when everybody else went to the Inaugural balls. As we started to
                    descend to land at Andrews Air Force base, a whole bunch of red lights flashed
                    on in the cockpit. I wondered what was going on. The officer came to me and
                    said, “We're having problems with the landing gear, and we'll have to circle
                    around several times.” It's dark by now.</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, wouldn't it be a funny thing if, on this day, the day my
                    government career is ending, if this damned plane crashed.” I started thinking
                    about lots of things.</p>
                <p>In any event, eventually the gear came down and we landed safely. But all the
                    emergency vehicles were lined up near the runway there at Andrews. I guess that
                    few minutes, reflecting on my career and my life up to that point, spurred me to
                    sit down and write. I wrote almost continuously for three days at home and in
                    the office that I still had in the State Department, and produced maybe 60,000
                    or 80,000 words. My secretary, or someone the State Department had assigned to
                    me, cleaned up the typos and the format for me. This paper was really intended
                    for my family and my personal use. It wasn't written with any notion of
                    publication.</p>
                <p>So I keep getting badgered by my family to write my memoirs; and I keep telling
                    them that I'm doing an oral history with you; and if they just wait, they can
                    listen to it and then read the transcript. But I do have that particular
                    document.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, you know, there's a possibility, because we throw things together,
                    because I view this more as repository, the niche thing being a unique thing. If
