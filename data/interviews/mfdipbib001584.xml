                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 18th of June, 1999, and this is an interview
                        with Reuben Lev. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. I'd like to
                        start at the beginning. Could you tell me where and when you were born and
                        something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I was born July 12, 1930 in Brooklyn, New York. I am a first generation
                    descendent, depending upon what part of the history you're looking at, of
                    Russian, Polish or Byelorus immigrants. My mother was a homemaker. I was the
                    last of seven children, six brothers and a girl. And my father had been an
                    escapee from the Imperial Russian Army, he and his brother. They went to fight
                    the Japanese during the Russo-Japanese War, and they just kept going. And my
                    uncle ended up going, I guess it would be, west to England and settled in
                    Canada. My father went east and then turned west, and he ended up in New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did he get to New York, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: He would have gotten to New York just at the outbreak of the First World
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About 1914.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: About 1914, 1915. My mother had arrived several years before he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did she get to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LEV: They had worked very, very hard, and like other immigrants, they just packed
                    up their suitcases. With my eldest brother, they had gone to Hamburg, and then
                    they couldn't get out of Hamburg, and they ended up leaving through Antwerp. And
                    from Antwerp they ended up in Ellis Island and in New York City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just in time, too? Because World War I wiped those ports
                        out for a time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, that was it. She had gotten in under the wire, and my father had just
                    beat the guns of August, 1914.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your parents married or met where?-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: They had married and met in what is now Byelorus. My mother was from a small
                    town called Slonim, and my father was from a small town called Volkovysk. And my
                    mother's family, from what we understand from some oral history, had a very good
                    position in the town because they had a wood floor in the cabin, and her father
                    had been the official slaughterer, the kosher slaughterer, of meats and
                    chickens. So evidently they did comparatively well. About my father I don't know
                    too much other than that he was a musician and a typical day-to-day laborer
                    before he ended up in the Russian Army. He became an infantryman, and he was
                    also a member of the division or battalion band.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a bit about family life. Was your family orthodox
                        or where were they on the religious scale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: In the religious scale, they were considered orthodox. My father was a
                    member of what we would call in Yiddish a little shul. The shul was made up of
                    friends and families from the original town, this was the way they did things
                    when they came over. They would get together with those that were residents of
                    the same town, and set up their own little shuls. And in this case it was set up
                    in a storefront. Then they found some additional space, and then they set up
                    what they felt was a legitimate synagogue, with the ark and the Torah and
                    everything else. And my mother kept a kosher home, but she understood that in
                    the real world it might be different. When you're outside the home, she said she
                    hoped that we would be able to maintain a kosher life. But she knew what was
                    going on here in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My father was a rather fascinating guy. He was one of the officials of this small
                    synagogue there in Brooklyn, and he religiously went Friday nights and Saturdays
                    and all the holidays, and he made sure that I learned Hebrew so I could be
                    confirmed, my Bar Mitzvah, as he did with all the other boys. M mother was, I
                    think, well ahead of her generation. My sister, and she's the only one left, but
                    Rachel, was unusual in that she had a mother who pushed her to go to school, not
                    to go the usual route, you know, learn how to read and write, get married, have
                    babies, and that's the end of it. But she made sure that Rachel did get a full
                    education, and my sister graduated from Hunter College as a lab tech. Mom made
                    sure that she prepared herself for life in America. “Live in America” was at
                    that time a definite dream, and we more or less fulfilled it. We were brought up
                    during the depression. Things were rough, as I think you can probably attest
                    to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, anybody of our generation can.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I remember as a kid we were all out there hustling, shining shoes, selling
                    papers - but there was a home life, and Mom made sure that she was the real
                    dominating factor, while Pop would disappear about five in the morning and come
                    home at nine or ten at night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: He was a presser in the garment industry in Manhattan. There was the Star
                    Craft or Starlight Dress Company, the Record Dress Company, I'm sorry, I can't
                    quite remember. But the important thing - and I was very, very fortunate, as
                    were my siblings - was that there was a central, hard-core family, and Mom made
                    sure that we had food, whatever there was, we were all clean, and the important
                    thing was education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If your father was gone, what about dinner table talk and
                        all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LEV: There was very, very little that I would remember because, I was the last
                    and rather a surprise to my mother (my mother was well into her 40's when I came
                    popping along - there was six years between me and my next brother). But I do
                    remember that on Friday night he was always home for the Sabbath dinner and
                    Saturday, and sometimes on Sunday he would take me and my other brother, and we
                    used to go for walks and things like that. But during the week, from Monday
                    through Thursday, there was very little table talk other than among my brothers
                    and my sister. Rachel at that time was working part-time, too, while going
                    through high school and college. At that time my eldest brother had been
                    married, and Morris had been a customs inspector, as was my next brother. So we
                    did have dinner together on Friday night and Saturday and sometimes on Sunday.
                    The talk was who did what to whom and how were things going. And then of course
                    I remember during the war itself, some of the very sad notes and letters that
                    came from Europe and then all of a sudden stopped. In fact, I still have several
                    souvenirs of those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was born just two years earlier, in 1928. In these early
                        years when you were in Brooklyn, did you get a feel for politics?
                        Particularly in the Jewish community, socialism was a big deal, but also you
                        had the New Deal. I was wondering, did you have a picture of Roosevelt in
                        your house?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Roosevelt, but in my house was Eleanor, not Frank. The day began with
                    Eleanor and it closed with Eleanor. My mother and my sister had a love affair
                    with the woman. I remember one time that she visited the local high school,
                    Thomas Jefferson, which was around the corner from where we lived. She gave a
                    talk at about eight o'clock, and the auditorium was literally wall-to-wall
                    people and their kids. But basically they were apolitical. They wanted to make
                    sure that any person in politics, other than Herbert Hoover, was considering the
                    masses, not from a Communist or a socialist point of view but with people out
                    there busting their buns, to put it bluntly, that there should be some sort of a
                    fair wage. My father had been one of the first members of the International
                    Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and my mother was very, very proud of him
                    because it was a pretty gutsy move in their time. It was neither socialism nor
                    Communism that they supported, but as Pop used to tell us a fair and equitable
                    system, where if you do piecework, everybody should get the same amount of
                    money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you started out, where did you go to elementary or
                        grammar school and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LEV: I went to a typical New York City public school at that time, PS 182. The
                    first couple of months I had problems because like most of my friends and
                    playmates, I basically spoke Yiddish. So English became for me like ESL, English
                    as a second language. What was unique about the area I was brought up in (and I
                    didn't realize it was a slum until I took a sociology course at NYU) was that it
                    was truly a mixing bowl. You'd hear everybody yelling in Polish, Yiddish,
                    Italian, German but we all understood each other. We'd go back to our own little
                    homes but then we all met again in school, and met additional friends. The
                    teachers were teachers then. As my mother told us, they were like gods or
                    goddesses. Whatever the teacher said, that was it. You didn't challenge them,
                    and you did not disrupt the class. And a couple of times when my mother found
                    out I did disrupt the class, and she said, “You don't do that in class,” and got
                    me home and gave me the just-in-case smack across the head. But we were taught a
                    tremendous amount of respect for education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In playing, was it a pretty mixed group? Were there Polish
                        and Irish kids?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: It was an unusual community there in Brownsville. In one area we had the
                    Poles. There was a Greek Orthodox group. There were the Italians, the Russians,
                    the Jews, and the Jews themselves came from a great variety of places. So it was
                    really a fantastic mixing-bowl. And we didn't care.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: We also had an area of blacks, so that in school there was a
                    sampling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the blacks part of the community, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Very, very little. They were on the periphery. One or two might join us in
                    playing kick-the-can or punchball. In school, of course, we'd all be together,
                    but then after school they had a two- or three-block area, and they stayed
                    pretty much to themselves. And you know, looking back from 50, 60 some odd
                    years, I can understand why, but at that time, whether the guy was black, blue,
                    or whatever made no difference to us. We didn't see color, and that was the
                    beauty of the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about religious observance during the High Holy Days?
                        Did you attend services?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LEV: I was observing those, and again with my mother and father keeping me in
                    tow, especially the Yom Kippur and the Passover services. And I was studying for
                    my Bar Mitzvah. I had a man who looked to be a million years old teaching me the
                    rules and regulations and how to put on the tefillin so I'd be prepared for the
                    time when I'd be called up for the Torah reading. And we also respected a lot of
                    the other people who were Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and everything else.
                    They would invite us to their homes, you know, to show us, this is what we do on
                    Christmas, or this is what we do on specific saints' days. And again, I may
                    sound like a parrot, but it was an absolutely phenomenal mixing bowl, and there
                    was a semi-integration. There were differencethere was no doubt about ibut yet
                    when it came to religious observance, in those days in New York City, come the
                    Jewish High Holy Days, the city came to a screeching halt. And during the
                    Christmas and some of the major Christian holidays, the city also came to a

                        Foreign Service was a Lebanese Christian, Philip Habib, and he was a Shabbos

                <p>LEV: They used to pay him to put the gas stove on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Put the stove on and things like that. What about reading
                        and things that you did for fun?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, as a kid - I think we're still talking about that part of my liflike
                    everybody else, I used to like comic books. I remember that when the first issue
                    of Superman came out I was about five years of age. At that time they went for
                    the strong men, like Captain America and Captain Marvel and Shazam and Billy
                    Batson. But it was the teachers who said, “Hey, you're going to start reading
                    these books.” So for relaxation at home or at night or wherever we would swap
                    comic books, but in school, the teachers made us read us books that were
                    possibly two or three years beyond us. And we all read on grade in those days.
                    If you were in second grade you would read at the third and fourth and fifth.
                    But we read anything and everything. And then they also at that timthis was
                    toward the latter part of my childhooClassics Illustrated came out, books like
                    Tale of Two Cities in comic book form. Basically that was my introduction to the
                    so-called classics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a good library where you lived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: A fantastic library. This was part of the New York City library system which
                    in those days was phenomenal. When I got to third or fourth grade you were
                    required to have a library card and every two or three weeks Mrs. Stocker told
                    me or told the class you had to do a book report, on any book you chose. And
                    again, the library branches were phenomenal. It was just great, just absolutely
                    great.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you listen to radio programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Oh, yes, the usual kids' programs. You'd get home at about 3:15 and you
                    listen to, what was it, “Jack Armstrong” and “Captain Midnight” and “Henry
                    Aldrich” and Eddie Cantor and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Movies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Movies - whenever we could put together our 11 cents. And this may be
                    illegal, but at those times 10 guys would chip in a penny, and one guy would buy
                    the ticket, and all of sudden he would go upstairs and open up the exit door,
                    and 10 kids could go running in. And the matrons would be running around. But
                    most of the time we were pretty legitimate.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: You also had the Yiddish newspapers in those days.</p>
                <p>LEV: My father had the liberal paper, the Daily Forward. One time when I was
                    selling newspapers, I had an extra copy of the communist Freiheit, and I brought
                    it into the house. That was the first and last time I ever brought that in.
                    Well, to me, a Jewish paper was a Jewish paper. They loved to read the paper,
                    and then of course, in those days in New York (and I think it still exists)
                    there was a Jewish radio program. It was WEVD, and every Saturday night, after
                    Shabbos and every Sunday, my mother and father would listen religiously to the
                    programs, whether it was a Jewish philosopher or a Jewish opera or the Bagelman
                    sisters, who became the Barry Sisters. It was a hard life, but it was rich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Yiddish theater? Did you get to that at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Oh, yes. We sat in what in those days they called the family circle. People
                    from the same town formed a club or a family circle, and they would get special
                    tickets to the Yiddish theater once or twice a month. There was a big one on
                    Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, and then of course the major ones were on Second
                    Avenue and around Houston Street. So I was fortunate to see some of the big
                    ones: Luther Adler, Molly Picon, Seymour Rexite, and Jacob Jacobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got up to high school, where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LEV: Well, it was a local high school, Thomas Jefferson, that would have been in
                    '45. The war had ended. I was angry because before going to high school, I used
                    to live around the corner from the high school, and then we moved a mile and a
                    half away, but I still had to go back to the same school. At that time, up until
                    the early '50's, Jefferson was ranked in the top 10 academically. It was a
                    phenomenal school. We had phenomenal, very experienced teachers, and they took
                    nothing from anybody. And going through it, I griped and grumped like everybody
                    else, but in retrospect it was an excellent education because we had dedicated
                    teachers, male and female. They weren't there because it's a job. They were
                    there because they were actually dedicated. So again, I lucked out in the high
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did World War II have much of an impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: World War II did have an impact on the family. My brother ended up in the
                    army. My eldest brothers ended up with the Department of the Treasury. Morris
                    and Bill who were customs inspectors took on other responsibilities for
                    safeguarding the ports. My sister wanted to join the Waves. She had been a
                    graduate of Hunter College, as I mentioned before, and she was going to go in.
                    But unfortunately, at that time, because she was Jewish, they had a list of 10,
                    and she was always number 11. So Rachel went to work in a hospital and also was
                    involved in performing certain tests that she never did tell me about but that
                    dealt with the military. As a kid, I said, “Mom, I want to run off. I'm 14, I
                    can join the Merchant Marine.” She said, “Over my dead body!” My mother made
                    sure I stayed through high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In reading the news during World War II, you could pick up
                        a sense of geography and the rest of the world. Was that true for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: It certainly was. When I was stationed in Brussels at NATO in '80-'83, my
                    reading and hearing first-hand what was going on during the Second World War
                    made that assignment that much more interesting because, hey, Lev, you are
                    there. And whether it's the D-Day beaches or the First World Wait really started
                    me on being a history buff ever since, I would say, 1942.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: Did you have to keep a scrapbook of newspaper articles and a log in
                    school?</p>
                <p>LEV: Yes, we were required in school to do so by the teachers. We said, “What are
                    we doing this for?” When the Battle of the Bulge started in December of 1944, we
                    were required to track it day by day. When it was over in January, my brother
                    sent me a bunch of letters, describing his experiences. He was a combat
                    corpsman, and he was assigned at that time to a rest area in a general hospital,
                    which all of a sudden was behind the lines. When I ended up in Belgium I tried
                    to find the family on whose farm he stayed. One of the family remembered him,
                    but unfortunately the farm that he was kept on now has an autoroute running
                    right through the property.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, I don't know if lunch and rest period count, but my favorite subjects
                    were history and geography and economics. And I enjoyed math and science, but I
                    was selective. But I really had a lot of fun with the social sciences.</p>

                        question. What was social life like in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Oh, it was absolutely fantastic.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: Especially since he was also on the football team, which he hasn't
                    mentioned, and he was also All-City Orchestra, which he hasn't mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk about these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, I was a dynamic 130 pounds and about five-foot-five, five-foot-six,
                    and I went out for the football team, and I did play for Jeff a couple of years.
                    And also I loved the trumpet because my brother, who ended up in the army, left
                    his trumpet behind when he went off to war. And I became a trumpet player. I
                    used to pay 50 cents a week for my lessons, which was a bundle in those days. I
                    joined the band at Jefferson, along with playing football, and I was selected
                    with several other people to become part of the All New York City Symphony
                    Orchestra. I think the most exciting time at that point was when Bruno Walter
                    couldn't make it, and we had some guy called Leonard Bernstein leading us at the
                    Brooklyn Academy of Music. How do you play when you're in awe at the same
                    time?</p>
                <p>But the social life waagain, it was as different worlthe problems of today with
                    drugs and stuff, I'm sure were there than. But the peer pressure was a positive
                    pressure. The clubs weren't what a club is considered to be now, but a club in
                    the true sense of the word, where guys and gals got together. They would have
                    parties on Saturday nights, they would go on trips to museums in New York City.
                    And we'd get together, and it wasn't unusual that I would go out with somebody
                    else's girl, but once you were going steady, there was the unwritten rule that
                    said, okay. But there were always mix and match, things to do. And if it sounds
                    almost like a sylvan world, it wasn't quite. We had our moments. But basically,
                    socialization was very, very good. We all had similar wants, similar likes,
                    similar dislikes, and I guess it was because of this almost ghettoish life that
                    we all led, and our mixing-bowl life with people of different race, religion,
                    and creed.</p>

                        recall family pressure was to stay with somebody of your own religion. This
                        was across the board. It wasn't nasty. It was just, “Can't you find a nice
                        Jewish girl?” or in my case, “Couldn't you find a girl who's not Catholic?”
                        We all palled around together, but there was this particular
                        constraint.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, I think, for my own family, it was an unwritten rule that likes would
                    go to likes. I don't remember that in my group there were any interracial or
                    inter-religious marriages. We all went out together but we all ended up in the
                    same social group and the same social group would be either within the church or
                    within the synagogue or sometimes there was a YMCA (Young Men's Christian
                    Association) and a YMHA (Young Men's Hebrew Association). So you had the Y's for
                    the Christian group and the Y's for the Jewish group, and they would get
                    together, but when it came to serious dating, I think people pretty well stayed
                    intra-religious and intra-racial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there was pressure, and I don't consider it
                        particularly biased. It was just that it was better to do it this way than
                        that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: It was the way it is, and to some degree, I think, a lot of people still
                    believe in it. But if you look at my family now, our family is the UN. I have a
                    niece who is Thai. I have a nephew who is Italian. We've got a niece who is
                    Roman Catholic. I have a Puerto Rican elative. I have another niece who is
                    black, but she's from Trinidad. Let's see, I've got a Jewish wife-</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: By chance.</p>
                <p>LEV: -by chance, and the irony is the only niece who married a Jew divorced him
                    and married an Italian. Sean is Irish Catholic. Helene's gone through several
                    marriages, from a Jew to... right now she's got herself a-</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: —Catholic, very nice guy.</p>
                <p>LEV: Mulligan, delightful guy. He is a retired superintendent of schools in
                    Buffalo. So this is what happens. And I think we've always been that way. We've
                    always felt that the name of the game is that the kids are going to outlive us;
                    they have to live their lives. If they're comfortable with their mate, male,
                    female, or whatever, that's fine. And so far in my crazy family, it's worked out
                    comparatively well. But in those days it wasn't, “Hannah, you've got to marry a
                    Jewish boy.” It just was a feeling that this is what would happen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, what happened, when I was getting ready to graduate in June '48 and
                    the draft started up again. I was a good high school student, but I wasn't
                    really a class ace; I was a good strong C+/B- student. In the New York City
                    public college system you had to take an entry examination. I did well on the
                    exam, but when they factored in my high school average, I couldn't make it
                    during the daytime, but I was given what they called a provisional space. That
                    meant if I went at night and maintained a B average, I could automatically
                    transfer to daytime. I was going to do that, but then when they started the
                    draft I figured, well, let me get my military time in right now. So instead, in
                    '48, I enlisted in the navy to get into naval aviation. And then the Korean War
                    broke out and I had my flight training and through the five years I was in the
                    navy it was a lot of fun. I was young, no responsibility, had money, and
                    responsibilities in the service. I survived the Korean War, and became a
                    meteorologist also. And then when my mother had passed away, I got a hardship
                    assignment for three months at Floyd Bennett Field, and that's where I met this
                    young lady. Then I ended up with the hardship tour with the Sixth Fleet in the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back to the beginning, in the navy. Where
                        did you take boot training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I as at Great Lakes, got there October '48 and finished in about January of
                    '49. And then after boot training we were transferred to the Alameda Naval Air
                    Station in San Francisco. And then for flight training they transferred us to
                    Milton, Florida, to the naval air station at Whiting Field, and we were there
                    for about 12-15 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “flight training,” what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, you trained in an SNJ-5. Then I ended up with what they called the Sky
                    Raider, the AD-2, which was in Corpus Christi. And then we went to the Valley
                    Forge, when the Korean War broke out, and then I came back to Ellison Field. And
                    then ended up in Floyd Bennett when my mother passed away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Korean War what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>LEV: I was with the VA 165 on the Valley Forge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Let's see, we went from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, picked up the squadron,
                    and then from there we were off port in Sasebo, Japan. And then out into the Sea
                    of Japan, and we did our work from there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for Korea or Japan while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I got more of a feel for Japan. It was a lot of fun, and especially when we
                    pulled into port at Sasebo. The Japanese still weren't quite sure what to make
                    of the crazy Americans, considering it was only about four or five years after
                    the war. But we were well treated, well taken care of. It was a fascinating
                    culture, totally 180 degrees the opposite of what we ever thought. I learned
                    that when you're in a foreign place, you try not to get involved with Americans.
                    I carried that into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I know. I mean, I was with the air force, a
                        ground person, doing Russian in Japan at the same time. It was fascinating.
                        A real eye-opener. A lot of us were saying, I want more of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: The bug was there, and as I said, I knew that there was more than Brooklyn
                    in '48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so you came back. You met your wife when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I met Marilyn New Year's Eve, 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: She was going out with a friend of mine, I think.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: We met at a party.</p>
                <p>LEV: At a party.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: What was that that you said? You don't know how you got engaged? I
                    think it's a male thing. We met at a party and didn't date after that. We each
                    dated each other's friends for about two years, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, when did you get married? Were you still in
                        the navy when you got married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: No, no, I left the navy in October of '53. We got engaged in November of '53
                    and got married in April of '54.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about when you were with the Sixth Fleet? How long
                        were you out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: We were out there from April until October. Then they sent me and a group of
                    other people back. It was a fascinating trip. We had flown from Nice, France, to
                    Lagos and the Azores, and to Brazil, and from Brazil up to Westover Field. That
                    itself is a wonderful trip. That would have been in '52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And while you were in the Navy, what were you thinking of
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, I was going to make a career of the navy. But since the new GI bill
                    for Korean vets had just been signed I figured, well, let me get out, and get a
                    college education, and maybe I'll follow my original career while becoming a
                    lawyer or some sort of an administrator. So that's what I did, and I ended up at
                    the Washington Square College of NYU (New York University), and we were married
                    '54. I pushed through in two and a half years, and I graduated in October,
                    1955.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: With honors.</p>
                <p>LEV: With honors. And then I took a nationwide examination for a public
                    administration internship in the New York state government. I got one of the 30
                    annual positions. I got very interested in public administration and political
                    science, and I got a scholarship for grad school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to graduate school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: The Graduate School of Public Administration at NYU. It took mI was going at
                    nighfour years to get a master's degree. And I stayed with the New York State
                    Department of Tax and Finance for about 8 years, and then I was transferred as a
                    management analyst with a new organization, the Administrative Board of the
                    Judicial Conference of the State of New York, that was responsible for revising
                    the whole court system in the State of New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the New York system like where you worked? Was
                        there much in the way of politics, or were politics concerned, or were they
                        keeping it pretty professional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, it was like any political entity, whether it's state, federal, or
                    whatever. You had your hard-core civil service, and I was a civil servant, and
                    we had at the top the commissioners who were politically appointed. But we had
                    good people who were political appointees. The Democrats were running New York
                    City, and the Republicans were running New York State, so you had Republicans in
                    charge of the state operations, but within the cities you had Democrats. I was
                    lucky. I had supervisors who trained me. They were all pragmatists, and I
                    learned a lot from that too. Because you have the book way of doing things, you
                    have the political way of doing things, and you have the real-world way of doing
                    things. And it was a matter of how do you mesh all three or how do you separate
                    the three, depending upon the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I was doing that until July, 1965 when I became a member of the Foreign
                    Service. Sometime in 1964 I read an article by a political appointee in the
                    Department of State talking about the problems that the Foreign Service and the
                    Department of State as a whole was having in restructuring itself to meet the
                    needs of different world. I sent this person a letter with my resume saying that
                    I agreed with the article and believed that with my experience, background, and
                    training, I would fit in very, very well with the Department of State. And then
                    I received a package in the mail from Bernie Rosen, who described a new program
                    they were establishing, the Foreign Service reserve program. This involved a
                    five-year appointment with the possibility of renewal for another five. And I
                    said, “While five years is fine with me, is there a way of getting into the
                    Department of State, whether through a civil service appointment or whatever?”
                    He said, “There is the Foreign Service Staff program, which you're overqualified
                    for.” Which is also basically the same thing as the FSR or an FSO, but it deals
                    with the managerial end of the Foreign Service. But there's no limit. If you're
                    good, you're good. And I said, “I prefer going the FSS route to the FSR route.”
                    And then we got a letter, and we were invited up for an interview.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: You were invited, but you took me along because I had never seen
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>LEV: I was invited. And the boarlet's see, I'm trying to remembethere was Coulter
                    Denham Hyler III, a fellow by the name of Bill Buffalo, and a third fellow. I
                    don't remember who was on my panel. But when they found out that Marilyn was
                    waiting for me down there in the old second floor somewhere, they said, “Would
                    she mind if she came into the interview?” And Marilyn was invited.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: I minded my own business reading a magazine.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>LEV: So what was rather unusual at that time, and looking back when I myself was
                    with the Board of Foreign Service Examiners, it was unusual to bring in the
                    wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: A couple of weeks later, we got a letter offering us an appointment to
                    Jakarta. That was during the time of Sukarno. Marilyn at that time was very,
                    very pregnant with our daughter and we had a son who had Perthes disease. It was
                    a bone disease and he was in braces.</p>
                <p>I had heard from the counselor for administration in Jakarta recommending that I
                    not take the post, because we would have to evacuate Marilyn to Singapore for
                    the baby, and for any decent type of medical attention, we might have to
                    evacuate Brian either back to the States or possibly to Tokyo. So I refused the
                    appointment. Then I was offered and accepted an appointment in Santiago, Chile.
                    In July of 1965, I became a member of the Foreign Service, and my two-year
                    assignment ended up with almost five years; my DCM, Bob Dean, said, “Reuben, you
                    ain't going no place. You're staying here as long as I'm here.” And I had a
                    very, very exciting tour. We got involved with the local community, with my
                    locals (now nationals). The local staff was absolutely phenomenal, and we had a
                    heart-wrenching time when we finally left in April of 1970. To this day, in
                    1999, after 30 years, we're still hearing from them. In fact, our kids had a
                    surprise 45th wedding anniversary party for us, and I received a phone call from
                    one of my nationals, Ra�l, who had been one of my stalwarts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll talk about the time in Chile. You were there from
                        '65 to '70. Who was the ambassador when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Ralph Anthony Dungan was ambassador when I arrived, and he was followed by
                    Ed Korry, who had been in Ethiopia at the time. And the DCM's were Bob Dean and
                    Harry Shlaudeman, both excellent. My counselor for administration was Jim
                    Keegan, he had worked with Roger Abraham in Mexico City where he had a heart
                    attack, and they sent him to Santiago because it was a quiet post. And it was at
                    that time the Movimiento Izquierda Radical (MIR), the radical leftists, started
                    to really get involved, and the Frei government had legalized the Communist
                    Party, so Santiago was far from being that quiet post where you can recuperate
                    from your heart attack. Then we had Marty Mart�nehis name was Manuel Mart�nehe
                    was also the executive officer of the AID mission. We were one of the first
                    posts that integrated. We had a joint administrative staff, so we finally worked
                    together as a mission. This was not what Dungan had wanted, but Korry did. Marty
                    himself was an AID type; I was State; Ellis Glynn, the general services officer,
                    was State; as well as the USIA man. It was the first successful joint
                    administrative support (JAS) operation in Latin America I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I was the personnel officer and also filled in as administrative officer.
                    The hard work was integrating all these various personalities, and each one
                    protecting his turf. Sid Weintraub, who was the counselor for economic affairs
                    was also director of the AID mission. So integration not only happened on the
                    administrative side but also on the substantive side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time when AID had its own empire, and State
                        Department people were kind of annoyed because often AID got better benefits
                        and that sort of thing. I would have thought that putting AID and State
                        together would have been breaking a very big rice bowl, because AID would be
                        losing, essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Maybe because it was Santiago it worked out well and we all worked very
                    closely. I think there was a personal element that was able to overcome the
                    service rivalry. We had to for self-survival because at that time AID had the
                    balance of payments and operation reduction. It was a reduction in force where
                    you're going to have fewer men doing the same amount of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Ambassador Korry? How would you describe his
                        operation from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Korry was a fascinating guy. My understanding is that he had been either a
                    journalist or in some other career with the old Look Magazine. He had his own
                    way of dealing with things. I felt that Korry did not take professional
                    advantage of the people he had around him. He had a solid team, whether it was
                    the political or economic, but at times he just seemed to have his own agenda.
                    It did lead to some problems, and after we had left Chile in '70 he was removed.
                    I forgot who replaced him, but that was the time of the coup. And afterwards
                    when he wrote his own story about what had happened in Chile the only place he
                    could get it published was in one of those flesh magazines. I don't know if it
                    was Hustler or some ridiculous place.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: Maybe it was Playboy.</p>
                <p>LEV: No, it wasn't Playboy. It was, as I said, one of these back-bench magazines
                    that you would read with a brown paper cover. But, he was professional; he was
                    politically oriented; my own personal feeling is that he just did not know how
                    to take advantage of his excellent staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly, when you think of Harry Shlaudeman.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>LEV: There was Harry, there was Sam Moskowitz, who was his counselor for
                    political affairs; there was Sid Weintraub. These guys went out to the grass
                    roots and there was a young political officer named Keith Wheelock, who went out
                    to the countryside to find out what is going on there. They really understood
                    the situation while, for one reason or another, Korry either misread it or
                    didn't put it all together or, again, he may have had his own agenda. It's my
                    own personal view that when the balloon finally did go up and they threw Allende
                    out, he was surprised. And we just couldn't understand it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEV: I think that we felt very little change. Having come from New York City, it
                    was like going to another large urban center. Santiago at that time was about
                    three and a half million people. The Chilean population is somewhat similar to
                    the United States. About 85 per cent of European origin, and the other 15 per
                    cent are of Indian background. It was very, very Westernized, except in the
                    rural areas. It seemed that the only thing that changed was that we were
                    speaking more Spanish than English. It was a very comfortable transition.
                    Housing was excellent. The weather was phenomenal. The climate was like Los
                    Angeles, smog and all and the same type of temperature. The people were highly
                    educated; the literacy rate was about 90 per cent. And to the work itselit was
                    just a matter of moving my own background and expertise as an administrator and
                    adapting it to the need of an overseas post with multiple responsibilities for
                    the other agencies and people. We had at that time a staff, other than the Peace
                    Corps, of about 60 or 70 Americans in the embassy. AID was a similar size. AID,
                    State, and USIA employed about a hundred odd Foreign Service nationals. Plus
                    there were almost 300 Peace Corps volunteers throughout the country.</p>

                <p>LEV: Well, I do remember that they sent down a junior officer trainee who had 40
                    weeks of French. When I asked why they had sent a highly qualified French
                    speaker I was told that there were no francophone slots available. The only
                    available JOT (Junior Officer Trainee) slot was in Santiago. His name was Jimmy
                    Carter, believe it or not, but it wasn't the Carter. He was a sharp son of a
                    gun. He picked up Spanish [snap] like that. But other than that the operations
                    were pretty basic and we always had the FAMs to fall back on.</p>

                <p>LEV: Manuals. I always used them as a guideline. They were not my bible, but
                    there were times when I could use them to clinch as agreement with some of the
                    Foreign Service types. But those were very exceptional cases. Basically, it was
                    a matter of being a human being, being a listener, being as objective as the
                    system would permit. I also had an excellent support staff. My nationals were
                    fantastic, and several are still there. They were truly bilingual, they
                    understood English, slang expressions included..</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political situation when you arrived, and
                        how did it develop during your tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: When we first got there all we knew was what had been in our area studies. I
                    had no language study because there had been no time. I didn't pay much
                    attention to hat was going on for the first three months. I was just trying to
                    settle in as a family, finding out where the right buttons werfinding housing,
                    waiting for furniture to come down (which took about six months).</p>
                <p>But by about December I became very aware of what was going on in the political
                    arena. President Eduardo Frei, who had been elected in 1964, had legalized the
                    Communist Party, and that led the other radical groups to become more active. At
                    that time the Socialists were further to the left than the Communists because
                    the Communists having just been legalized wanted to preserve a moderate image.
                    The government itself was slightly left of center.</p>
                <p>Things were going a little bit better for the country. As a result of the Vietnam
                    War the copper prices were doing very nicely. They were going out of sight. But
                    Chile had no real manufacturing capability so raw material would be exported.
                    The finished product had to be imported at twice the price. Another probleone
                    that Frei was trying to addreswas that only about 35 or 40 per cent of arable
                    land was in agricultural use, and they were importing a tremendous amount of
                    stuff. What Frei wanted to do was to get more of the large ranches, called
                    fundos, under cultivation so as to minimize food imports. Now, in 1999, this is
                    exactly what they're doing, and some of our fruigrapes, apples, peaches and
                    pearis coming from Chile. But at that time, they were importing more than they
                    were exporting. And that led to some political unrest, and then, of course, the
                    extreme leftists took advantage of this thing and made a wedge and made it very
                    difficult that the universities and particularly in the universities there was a
                    lot of dissent and unhappiness on the part of the students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Lev, what was your perspective on how things were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: For about the first two years that we were there, Chile was very
                    pleasant. As a woman and as a wife, I didn't have any concerns about traveling
                    by myself from where we lived to Santiago proper. I had no concerns about our
                    son being at school or even leaving the baby with the maid for short periods.
                    But after we were there about two years, toward the end of 1967, things began to
                    change. One of the first signs for me of the change was Reuben coming home and
                    saying that the home of one of the military attach�s had had a firebomb thrown
                    at it. That really sort of began to signal changes.</p>
                <p>An ambassador from another nation told me not to accept packages, and to tell the
                    maid not to accept packages. And occasionally there were phone calls, if we were
                    at a coffee or if we were doing something with the ambassador's wife, telling
                    us, “Don't ask questions, go home and stay there,” or “Go home, the kids are
                    being sent home from school.” And the environment began to change. An American
                    friend and I had gone downtown shopping, and we were caught in a demonstration
                    that was really very frightening. We hid in a store because it wasn't the crowd
                    that was frightening, it was the water guns being used to control them. When
                    that ended we got home as quickly as we could. Another time I was in a taxi and
                    suddenly became aware of chanting and a mass of students, arms linked, walking
                    up the street. I was really very frightened. I didn't know what would happen or
                    where to go. But the driver turned around and said to me in Spanish that it was
                    not a demonstration against America; it was over a student problem. It was a
                    dramatically different environment. Social affairs with Chilean friends didn't
                    change. But there was a different sense for me as an American woman and wife,
                    that it was no longer this lovely peaceful place. One day we had gone to Vi�a
                    del Mar with the children and when we came home that night the maid was frantic.
                    We had passed through Santiago proper and seen a lot of tanks and army personnel
                    but hadn't thought too much about it. But she was afraid that we had been caught
                    in the demonstration that had involved a call-out of the military and several
                    deaths, too.</p>
                <p>And in Vi�a we hadn't known anything about it. So we didn't think to call her and
                    tell her we were all right, and when we came in it was like a fiesta, “You're
                    home! You're safe!” So the first two years was a different experience from our
                    final almost three years from the perspective of making a home and living with
                    your children and your family in a foreign country. I was certainly not
                    terrified all the time, far from it. Chile was a beautiful place to live, and
                    for the most part the people were wonderful, but there definitely was a change.
                    And not having been politically aware earlier, it was very much a learning
                    experience, albeit at times not comfortable. But that's part of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>LEV: The government itself, and this may sound like heresy, was too democratic.
                    It's difficult to explain, but there was too much leeway. There was very little
                    control from the top vis-�-vis the heavy imports of foodstuffs and of finished
                    products. The middle class was starting to become very strong, but there was
                    still at the top those who had a tremendous amount and at the bottom those who
                    had zilch, to put it bluntly. It just didn't work out the way he had hoped. It
                    was almost like Hooverian economics. The idea that if you put it in at the top
                    it will trickle down to the bottom didn't work. And people were angry about what
                    was going on, plus they used the business with the Vietnam Watranslated as the
                    imperialistic Yankee chewing up those poor people in Asia. And of course,
                    there's poor Cuba as the stalwart against the imperialistic Yankees. At the top
                    there was just a tremendous amount of, maybe it was complacency, people at the
                    top not listening to what was going on. This almost was the feeling that we had
                    about thinking within the embassy. Marilyn and I had a tremendous number of
                    informal contacts with the Chilean population, not only the people at the top,
                    but the middle class and some of the people below, the families of the maids
                    that we visited. They were telling us that there's too much complacency on the
                    part of the government about the situation with the people at the grassroots.
                    And this is what the political section with Sam Moskowitz were trying to explain
                    to Korry. In the elections in September, '69, there was a leaning toward the
                    left. Between September of '69 until we left in about April of '70, many of the
                    stories we were getting back from the field as well as through official and
                    informal sources were saying that there's going to be a problem in the September
                    1970 elections. And as a result, for the first time in Chilean history, that's
                    when Allende was elected on a plurality, and the rest, unfortunately, was
                    history, until '73, when Pinochet threw him out, and everybody was saying hurray
                    hurray hurray, and then there were the knee-jerk reactions, and I think we may
                    very well see this in a Kosovo situation. First we banged on the Albanians; now
                    the Albanian ethnics may start banging on the Serbians. So this was that was
                    happening, where the leftists were banging on the rightists in '70, and then in
                    '73, the rightists, who threw out the leftists, started to whack on them. But at
                    that point, I think, unfortunately, it became rather negative. But they looked
                    for Pinochet to come in.</p>

                        overlooked because we were concentrating on the Communists? What would you
                        say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I think it was the other side of the coin. Pretty much what I saw was that
                    the Socialists were more leftist than the Communists, and, I think, our
                    concentration, rightly so, was on the Socialist movement. The Communists were
                    still feeling their way back. They had been underground all the way from about
                    1940, about 20-some-odd years. So now that they were legitimate I think they
                    were just playing it coo“Hey, we don't want to rattle the cage,” so to speak.
                    But we had focused on the Socialists, and the extreme movementthe Izquierda
                    Radical. We had an excellent political section; they had their thumbs right on

                    what information could they give us? We were one of the very few who were taken
                    in by these people to their homes, to see their families. Some people in the
                    embassy to whom we relayed what we learned were b le to follow it up, and
                    learned that it was accurate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEV: Yes. They had told us what was going on. We had a very politically oriented
                    maid, she may have had a third-grade education, but Idesia was absolutely
                    phenomenal. We'd have somebody at the house, and Idesia would serve dinner, and
                    at the same time tell us whatever she thought of the political situation. She
                    had lived in a cayampa, which was a slum area. I remember one time we had a
                    bunch of clothing and mattresses and bedding that we took there. I nearly tore
                    up my station wagon. And we spoke to the extended family living in this house
                    maybe as big as the room we're in for the interview.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LEV: It had a kitchen tucked into an alcove. They were very, very proud people. I
                    remember the grandmother took us into this little cubbyhole, where she had an
                    old Singer sewing machine, and it was like the gods of Baal. We apologized
                    because one of the mattresses had gotten a tear when I pushed it into the
                    station wagon. And she chastised us, “It's only a tear. I can take care of
                    it.”</p>
                <p>But they told us what was going on there, and they would say, “There's no reason
                    for this. There's a lot of money, but it's stopping at the top. It's not coming
                    down to us.” And they said they don't want very much. What they wanted was a
                    fair and equitable wage. Or give us the land; let us work the land. Or let us
                    rent the land.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: They liked working for Americans. They didn't love Americans
                    politically, but they liked working for them.</p>
                <p>LEV: It's the old story, you know, “Yankee go home! (But take me with you)” kind
                    of attitude. But they were very, very open, very honest about it, and they were
                    excellent sources because they really represented the grassroots. And Idesia
                    wasn't a Communist, she wasn't a Socialist, she was just trying to be a
                    pragmatist; saying, we are the peopltry to do something more for us than what's
                    being done.</p>

                <p>LEV: Well, it was a fascinating period. I think I had more problems working with

                    the nationals really knew the real world, where many of my American colleagues
                    were ghettoized. They lived in the American area or the English-speaking area,
                    and they just went from their home to the embassy and back to their home. The
                    parties would be what I used to call “circularity.” The counselor of
                    administration would have a party, and then it would go to the economic
                    counselor, and then they would reciprocate, and then an Anglophone embassy would
                    have a party. You would go to them and you would reciprocate. But very, very few
                    were invited to the homes of the Chilean middle class or the intelligentsia, the
                    university professors and stuff. Sid Weintraub did get involved with the
                    intelligentsia because he himself had a doctorate, and we met some wonderful
                    people through some of our own nationals. And there was one national I had
                    working for me, his father was a colonel in the Carabi�eros, which was the
                    national police, and he invited us to his home, and it was just fantastic. But
                    among the Americans themselves, it was just, “What do you know?” Especially with
                    me; they were a little annoyed at me because I came in at the equivalent of a
                    5.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About a major in the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: And all of a sudden these guys say, “Hey, I remember when I started out as a
                    7. How dare they bring you in at that level?” And I'm saying, “What the heck's
                    the difference?”</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: It was an old-boy network. It was very rigid and passed on to their
                    wives as well. So it was a very stratified and that may very well have been true
                    in other embassies as well, judging b y what I heard from other people. Within
                    the American community, your identity was your rank in the Foreign Service or
                    your husband's rank in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>LEV: In the pecking order of the foreign service list I outranked some of the
                    guys that had been in the Service eight and ten years, and there I was up in the
                    top 15, and they were down in the bottom 20. But it didn't bother me. Rank never
                    bothered me. It never bothered me when I was in the navy; it was just working
                    with the individuals, how can we contribute. So there was a certain amount of
                    na�vet� because of my experience working with the State of New York had made me
                    somewhat naive. I was lucky there because as a generalist I had cut across all
                    sorts of ranks, so to speak, and all types of people with different types of
                    experience and professional backgrounds. And I think it was the generalist in me
                    that I carried to Santiago, and all in all I was successful with it, except for
                    the few to whom the pecking order was all important. And some of the wives would
                    say, “If I talk with her, what can she do for my husband?”</p>

                        stratification much more than the men. I was a consular officer, and in some

                </p>
                <p>LEV: I was transferred back to the States, and that began my love affair with the
                    Bureau of International Organization Affairs. I was brought back as an
                    international administration officer, and I dealt with all the international
                    organizations as an administrator, personnel officer, budget and finance
                    officer. It was a three-man office. I worked at that time at Wynn-Southworth.
                    Sam De Palma was the assistant secretary at the time. And after that most of my
                    career was within the International Organization Bureau.</p>

                        particular job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: From '70 to '73, I was working in the budgetary and administrative and
                    planning staff. Then I was assigned within IO to the staff dealing with
                    UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '73 to-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: '73 to '75, I guess. It was in the '73-ish, '74-ish area. After the UNESCO
                    job, I was detailed to the Civil Service Commission as a member of the
                    Presidential Panel on Federal Compensation as a result of my expertise in
                    international salary administration as well as with New York State. That
                    assignment lasted two years, and then I was reassigned back to the Department,
                    and I was put into Cultural Affairs which soon became the Educational and
                    Cultural Affairs Division of the International Communications Agency, the old
                    USIA. I was there until the latter part of 1979. I was working with John Shumate
                    as his assistant in administration. And then at the end of '79, I was assigned
                    to the U.S. mission to NATO. I went into language training, and left for NATO in
                    '80. And then the family joined me in the summer of '81. And I was an
                    international administrations officer there at NATO, working with Bob Stevens,
                    and army officer, who now is a retired army colonel. I was one of two of the
                    State Department civilians who was working in his division.</p>
                <p>I forgot a very important element of my life. Let me back up. I left the
                    Presidential Panel on Federal Compensation, it would have been about '75.</p>

                <p>LEV: Okay, but from toward the end of '75 to '78 I was assigned as the executive
                    officer on the National Commission for the Observance of International Women's
                    Year. My God, if I forgot at all, how could I forget that? And that was a result
                    of the “Decade of the Woman” of the United Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we just talk about the period '70 to '73 when
                        you first went into IO? What was your impression of IO, '70 to '73? This was
                        early Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Very early Nixon. Well, I found it very, very exciting because I found
                    myself, again, in a true generalist position, but nobody wanted an IO assignment
                    at the time because it didn't help you in your career. As I mentioned, there
                    were two or three of us in what became the Budgetary, Administrative, and
                    Planning Staff (UNBAPS). We were responsible for the administrative and
                    budgetary oversight of all the international organizations of which the U.S. was
                    a member of or had been an associate of. And I found it exciting in that it was
                    a multilateral operation; not the kind of a thing where you just work with one
                    group in a foreign ministry. Here you worked with different organizations,
                    different countries; you were working with senior personnel from the directors
                    general down, who were multinational. The Secretary General was U Thant, and it
                    was the time of the debt crisis. It hasn't changed very much in the last
                    20-some-odd years. But I was involved in dealing one-on-one with these
                    international organizations, and it was exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a professional public administrator, what was
                        your impression at that time of how the UN was run, from what you were
                        learning about compensations and staff caliber and from various people with
                        whom you were dealing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LEV: I found that in the UN and the other international organizations, members of
                    middle management and to a certain level senior management (those that weren't
                    politically appointed) were all top-notch in their field. They all knew what
                    they were doing, and at the same time they were all frustrated because they were
                    working for the Secretary General but he was under the gun of a 120 or 130
                    nations telling him how to run the organization. My theory, and unfortunately
                    it's been proven, is that international organizations were not set up to be
                    efficiently directed. There are just too many people who want too many pieces of
                    the action, and for them to become efficient would be almost like trying to get
                    the Department of Defense to be truly efficient or getting rid of the $16 hammer
                    or the $200 toilet seat. But they were run, under the circumstances,
                    comparatively well. They had to be carefuas all the governments were watching
                    theto make sure that you hired enough of our nationals, and put our nationals
                    within certain levels of the P-grades (P-1, 2, 3, 4, 5), that we had our proper
                    proportion of people. But administratively they were good. A manager who would
                    have been an Afghani had to ride herd over other multinationals, some of whom
                    from a political point of view were not exactly friends. It's like putting a
                    Pakistani in charge of an Indian. Or you would have an Iranian who would be a
                    boss of an Iraqi, or an American in charge of a Russian or vice versa. It was
                    like a math project, all sorts of permutations and combinations. And this was of
                    great help to me in what would be later interviews in my last assignment. But
                    the people, I think, were goowere dedicatebut at the same time, the higher
                    echelon were being torn by 130-some-odd governments telling them how to run
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling that you were getting about U
                        Thant.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LEV: I found that U Thant was comparatively weak because he was being pushed and
                    pulled. At that time, the period from '70 to '73, was a dynamic period. The
                    Vietnam War had wound down, and there were problems that were just bursting out
                    all over the place, and the UN was being asked then, as they are now, to do
                    things that they're just not capable of doing, such as setting up peace forces.
                    But from the humanitarian point of view, I think he did very, very well under
                    the circumstances. Our big argument at that time was that the United States was
                    paying too much in dues. The assessment at that time was over 30-some-odd per
                    cent, and we had recommended a cut back to 25 percent. There was a big battle
                    about that. My recommendation that of one of my co-workers' was to leave it
                    alone at present but when any new nation came in our dues should be reduced
                    proportionately. The irony is, had we done that, we would have been well below
                    20 per cent, because of the increase from 120-odd nations to about 150-odd. But
                    maybe it was political but the decision at that time was to say, “We stay at 25
                    per cent.” Another recommendation, my colleague and I had made at that time and
                    were laughed out of court was to treat the organization like a country club.
                    Every member of the country club pays an equal share, so if you have 125
                    members, divide the bill by 125. But others said: no, no, that's not fair, it's
                    not equitable. The United States is the rich brotheand after the Second World
                    War it was true. We had about the only decent economy going. We have the same
                    problem in dealing with the assessment at the OAS. I think we were assessed over
                    66 per cent but we only paid the equivalent of 50 per cent because we felt that
                    that would be our fair share. So technically we were running about 15 per cent
                    behind. But it did force the OAS and to some degree the UN into a more focused
                    managerial operation. One of the recommendations that was acceptein '71, '7was
                    to establish a salary review committee; I was an adjunct to the U.S.
                    representative on that. The object was to bring UN salaries more in line with
                    those of the so-called host government. The salaries at that time were just
                    crazy. They're still a little bit nuts, but they're still in reason. They had
                    used Geneva as the base for the UN salary so that if you worked in New York, you
                    had what is similar to our cost-of-living when we're overseas, which meant that
                    in order to maintain your standards in Geneva, you were given an extra amount of
                    money in New York. So one of the important changes made by the committee was to
                    move the base from Geneva to New York. But then costs in Geneva went crazy, and
                    anybody working in New York did very well. Also, based on what I think was
                    called the Ottawa Agreement employees of the UN system would be tax-free. The
                    United States is one of the only countries that has not agreed to that. This
                    resulted in another weird situation, a tax equalization fund. This provided that
                    an American working alongside an Indian in the same job, in order to equalize
                    their emoluments would be a reimbursement for his tax payments. This led to a
                    pyramiding effect. You would pay $1,000 in taxes; the UN would give you back
                    your $1,000; but you would have to add that $1,000 on to your regular taxable
                    income.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the '70 to '73 period what was the attitude towards the
                        United Nations and international organizations from the Nixon White House
                        and the Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LEV: Well, we had a congressman from New York, John Rooney, with great power over
                    appropriations. Rooney was not a lover of anything international, and every time
                    IO prepared a budget, it ran into trouble with Rooney. One of the things that
                    got him going was the amount of building that was going on in Geneva for the
                    headquarters buildings for the ILO and an organization, believe it or not called
                    BURPI, which is the French acronym for the international patent office. They
                    were all putting up headquarters buildings because they had outgrown their old
                    headquarters. But Rooney didn't like the idea of their building what he called
                    “monuments.” He was right to some degree because they wanted some elaborate
                    things. But these plans were cut back not only by the United States delegations
                    but those of other countries as well and even within organizations. But he
                    didn't like the buildings themselves, and when we had to pay our dues, he threw
                    in a lot of roadblocks; we shouldn't pay for this, shouldn't pay in for that. To
                    him the UN staff was overpaid and under worked, and this was the general
                    attitude. But other than that, it made no difference whether it was Nixon or
                    Carter. The attitude toward international organizations was the same and I think
                    it is even today. Once you leave the beltway, the UN is just another acronym.
                    Once you get out of Washington and New York City, people really have no idea
                    what international organizations are about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself as part of a team fighting the
                        battle to keep us in the UN system where we should be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Yes, it was difficult because of attitudes beyond the beltway that the UN is
                    a debating society; what do we need it for? And then while we were trying to
                    tell them in simple terms, maybe if its a debating society we'll learn to speak
                    instead of going to war as we did with the League of Nations fiasco. To some
                    degree it's been successful, not necessarily the UN but the other international
                    organizations like the World Health Organization, the International Labor
                    Organization, ICAO, and the others. It's been a good sounding board where people
                    can present certain things; even today we're dealing with the World Trade
                    Organization. But though we agree or we disagree, at least there's a forum where
                    you can bring your problems. And what I kept being reminded of is the
                    Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, to what all those guys did, and it
                    was exactly the same thing. They found a common give-and-take, a balance as to
                    how do we achieve things?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that Nixon wasn't trying to undercut the UN
                        the way Ronald Reagan did at a later point, at least early on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LEV: No, I think Nixon and Carter were pretty amenable, as long as the UN didn't
                    rattle their own political agendas. And, with Rooney on the Democratic side and
                    then with Helms as a minority member in the Senate, Nixon felt he had pretty
                    good control over the type of people he could recommend for ambassadorships as
                    well as in dealing with the budget. I think with Reagan we ran into a different
                    type of philosophy, which was just generally misguided. The irony is that
                    Reagan, who hated big government, has more buildings and things named after him
                    as monuments to big government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I thought we would stop at this point, and we'll
                        pick this up in '73 when you were working with UNESCO from '73 to about
                        '74.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 30th of June, 1999. Reuben, let's talk about
                        UNESCO. In '73 we're into the Nixon Administration. What was the feeling
                        about UNESCO at that time, that you and other people had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, originally, before I went into UNESCO, I was part of the IO
                    administrative and managerial operation, which at that time was called IO/BAPS,
                    Budgetary, Administrative, and Policy Staffing. But then they needed me to serve
                    on the UNESCO desk within IO. At that time there were a lot of problems with
                    Congress dealing with UNESCO because we had been involved with the Egyptians.
                    There was the time of the Aswan Dam, everybody was worried about the cultural
                    destruction of Abu Simbel and the other temples. So the United States, which had
                    about three or four million dollars in Egyptian pounds, put it to good use; we
                    bought a temple, which is now in the Brooklyn Museum as part of the beautiful
                    exhibit there. However, Congress was very, very unhappy, because of what was
                    going on in Egypt and the whole Middle East shortly after the Yom Kippur War.
                    They asked, how dare we give the Egyptians money in these circumstances? One of
                    the congressional staffers told me, “Hey, look, we're getting bombarded with
                    letters from everybody, from people who are involved with all the religions
                    other than the Muslims that “Why are we feeding these guys money when they're
                    tearing heck out of the religious operations?” whether it's Christian, Muslim,
                    Coptic, or whatever. In discussions with some of the congressional staffers we
                    tried to explain to them that this had nothing at all to do with politics; it
                    had to do with the protection and preservation of something that once it's lost
                    is gone. That's when I first came in contact with the office of William Cohen,
                    who was a congressman from New England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, from Maine.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LEV: They were absolutely fantastic. Cohen had been able to diffuse the problem
                    up there in New England. We developed a boiler-plate letter as a response for
                    the congresspeople, and we were successful. I felt very, very good. This was one
                    of the few battles that we actually won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening with, say, John Rooney of Brooklyn? He
                        had a large Jewish constituency, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: When I spoke to Rooney's staff aide he said, there's a Jewish issue, and
                    Rooney has a lot of votes out there from Jewish people. And I said, “Look, that
                    has nothing to do with it. I'm Jewish. This is really directed towards the
                    protection of something that's cultural.” And then I said, “What would happen if
                    they took down the Arch at the Grand Army Plaza?” He said, “My God, that would
                    be sacrilege!” I said, “Well, that's it,” these are old temples that went back
                    to about the second millennium BC, and the one that we have went back several
                    thousand years and had also been converted later to a Coptic church. And so
                    Rooney's office was, I wouldn't say appeased, but happy with an honest
                    explanation. It was a PR (public relations) operation not pushing a Department
                    of State point of view but, a cultural point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get involved in any other issues? What about
                        our problems with UNESCO's leader, M'bow from Senegal, who was running
                        UNESCO like a little fief with all the problems that come with fiefdoms,
                        like corruption. In addition, Senegal was not particularly friendly towards
                        the United States at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: At the time Irv Lippe was the director of the office and all of us including
                    Fred Lawton and Will DeClerq were very much involved with trying to get the
                    UNESCO management to come back to the real world. But it was M'bow who was able
                    to dominate the operation, because he had all the other major contributors
                    behind him, even thought we were contributing 25 per cent. The other major
                    Western powers wouldn't go along with us. The French, because UNESCO is
                    headquartered in Paris and Senegal being a former colony, being Francophone,
                    they didn't want to put too much pressure on. Some of the rationalization for
                    not interfering was that M'bow was just doing things the African way. So we
                    weren't successful at that time in bringing the administrative roller coaster to
                    heel. In fact, to add insult to injurand this is where Rooney jumped all over
                    uthey put up a sixth building and so we had the issue of what they called the
                    sixi�me b�timent, and we fought like crazy. They needed it like hole in the
                    head, but again, we were unsuccessful. And again, it was that the Western allies
                    couldn't get together. And even if they did, the non-Westerners, the East
                    Europeans, had sufficient votes to defeat us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you sense any change in attitude towards UNESCO
                        in 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>LEV: In '73 there were ripples. We're kicking in 25 per cent of the budget and we
                    want at least 25 per cent results; but it was not what we were getting. IN fact,
                    M'bow was running an empire, a fiefdom. He had converted one of the floors as a
                    personal penthouse for himself and as a reception area. But one of the problems
                    also was that a director of administration, an American, was being driven up the
                    wall because he couldn't get to M'bow at all. He was pretty well frozen out.
                    M'bow had taken this fellow on as a sop to the Americans, but he froze him out
                    totally. There was a lot of anger, but to temper some of this anger, there were
                    many good UNESCO programs dealing with education, and other matters and a lot of
                    the NGOs (non-governmental organizations) involved that had a lot of good
                    programs and received a lot of support from the U.S. and from the State
                    Department. But on the administrative and managerial side, no matter what we did
                    we just couldn't get enough people to support us in saying let's put a stop to
                    this thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of the staffing of UNESCO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: In UNESCO, as in other international organizations, the political nature of
                    the beasgeographic distribution, the allocation of positions to member
                    statealways leads to a bloated bureaucracy or bloated secretariat. But I think
                    the key was that he was bringing in a lot of his own cronies, and that's how he
                    was able to get the votes. He said, “Hey, you know, Malawi, I'll give you two
                    P-4's for one P-5 and if you'll give me your vote.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: P-4 being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Being the equivalent of a mid-grade, about a GS-13. And then if the guy was
                    really good and he could garner some more votes, “I'll give you a P-5,” which is
                    equivalent to a GS-15.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these are tax free?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: They're all tax free. However the United States never signed the agreement,
                    exempting from national tax any national working for an international
                    organization. The United States was the only country that didn't agree. And so
                    the U.S. does tax American employees of international organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing with UNESCO? I mean, what was your

                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>LEV: Well, the oversight and management again dealt with getting this Feilai
                    temple into the proper track vis-�-vis the Congress and the public itself, also
                    dealing with programs vis-�-vis the M'bow syndrome, and also putting together
                    papers and trying to get additional support from the Hill to continue to
                    contribute to those programs that we felt were of national interest, again
                    dealing with education and science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that UNESCO was carrying out its educational
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Like any other organization, it bastardized itself to meet the lowest
                    denominator; and had it not been for the NGO's pushing for support of certain
                    programs, I think UNESCO's educational role would have been in trouble. There
                    were programs for international training of teachers, establishing schools in
                    places without them, developing text books that would meet the needs of certain
                    countries to improve literacy rates. Working with the World Health Organization,
                    UNESCO's programs included education about sanitation with respect to drinking
                    water for example. Improving literacy is important in this regard because if you
                    could read instructions one-half of your battle is over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there programs in this area that made the U.S. very
                        uncomfortablproblems relating to intrusion of strict governmental control or
                        indoctrination? Was the Cold War intruding into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, it was. But again, we were semi-successful tempering this. Many
                    countries, when they were preparing books and pamphlets were trying to rewrite
                    their own history. And for some at that time, the Soviet Union could do no wrong
                    while “imperialistic Yankees” were always wrong. The Soviet Bloc were really
                    expert at it. We were babes in the wood, but we learned very, very fast. The
                    NGO's did try to have UNESCO be apolitical. Now as far as what countries put in
                    their books, I think that was basically an internal affair and what can an
                    international organization do about that? In many of these emerging Third World
                    countries everything was controlled from the top. The press, all communications
                    were centralized; that's their culture, and that's they way they do things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, were we in a way trying to bypass
                        UNESCO, at least, or to influence UNESCO by dealing with the NGO's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>LEV: Yes, we had binational centers, and USIA was very, very instrumental in
                    setting up libraries. You knew this was successful when the authorities started
                    to burn the libraries, because the libraries had books covering all sides of an
                    issue, so that people could read and the academics or intelligentsia could do
                    research on all facets of a specific issue, and hopefully come up with a more
                    objective point of view. USIA would get books and the old reel-to-reel tapes
                    that people wanted. And the binational centers were also places where people
                    learned English if possible from local teachers who were English speakers. The
                    centers also had courses that trained people to do research, and do shorthand,
                    and things like that. And this apolitical American effort was really
                    appreciated. They did a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our UN ambassador during the '73-74 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: George Bush, and then John Scali. Bush's deputy was Tap Bennett, who was an
                    old pro. It turned out that Tap was my ambassador when I went to the U.S.
                    mission in NATO. But Bush was good. He listened. He led a pretty good battle
                    over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any push from IO to say, “Let's try to get this
                        in hand,” or was it just, particularly with UNESCO, “Well, they're doing
                        some good things and some bad things, and let's just play the game as best
                        we can”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, not quite, because at that time the assistant secretary was Sam De
                    Palma, and Sam was an old career FSO. We did what we thought was necessary, not
                    only with respect to UNESCO but to the UN system and what they called the
                    “common system” which included seven or eight other international organizations
                    including. We took the same approach to all of them focused on efficiency and
                    economies of scale. We accepted that there would be some fat, but what we wanted
                    was a good solid cadre of people who know what to do and how to do it. And, I
                    think, most of the international organizations did have that kind of personnel
                    who were dedicated to what they were doing. As in any large bureaucracy there
                    were the so-called 10 per cengive them their money but lock the door and don't
                    let them interfere with the true operation of the organization. This is the
                    approach we took. We fought quite a bit vis-�-vis the salaries of the
                    international organizationhow do you pay them, the allowances, the perks,
                    staffing? And we constantly reviewed the draft budgets. Numbers were important,
                    yes, but what kind of programs were they funding or what kind of programs were
                    they requesting? Were these programs in the interest of the organization? Were
                    they of interest to the United States? We looked at the programs from the
                    operational and managerial point of view. We tried to introduce zero-based
                    budgeting. We tried to introduce management by objectives. And they were very
                    receptive to state-of-the-art review of budgets and programs and operations.</p>

                    and they did a darn good job. Unfortunately, when the top is immovable there is
                    the threat that if you keep that up, we're going to write your job out of here.
                    But in spite of that, they did a pretty good job of trying to keep programs
                    going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the staffing in Paris or the whole Paris
                        operation sort of a burr under your saddle, was pretty flamboyant living, or
                        anything like that a problem from our perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: It wasn't exactly a burr; I think it was more like something caught in the
                    craw of their throat. What you had there, again, was a small group at the top
                    with M'bow. M'bow was an old politician from Senegal and he knew how to play the
                    pieces of his orchestra, so to speak, in order to make sure that his position
                    was protecteand it was. But again, going down the ranks, we were happy with what
                    people were doing. Some of the people put themselves in jeopardy by coming to
                    speak to us at the U.S. mission to UNESCO. We had some very interesting and
                    frank discussions with them. We would ask, “Why is this going on?” and then they
                    would say you have to go up to the higher ranks. That was a very, very slow
                    approval process, like going from one of our GS-2's to get to the Secretary of
                    State to sign off on something. And by the time the proposal finally got
                    approved or the problem got looked at it was already too late.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviets play a helpful or unhelpful role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, I felt it was rather unhelpful because if we said “black,” they said
                    “blue”; if we said green, they said orange. And no matter what came out of the
                    Western Bloc, it just didn't fit their agenda. I think basically their agenda
                    was just to disrupt, to show that, you see, they can't do anything right. To do
                    anything right you have to follow us. And in effect, it wasn't just the Soviet
                    Union it was really the Soviet Bloc. They were a potent political force because
                    they had sufficient votes, but at the same time they know how to wield their
                    power, to say: “If you vote that way, you're going to be in trouble, buddy.” And
                    they played hardball, and we played sort of a hardball game also. But I think we
                    stayed more democratic, fortunately, in talking with our groups. And we did have
                    groupLatin American group, the West European Organizations. Within each of the
                    groups we tried to get a point of view across. And sometimes it worked and
                    sometimes it didn't because of what was more important to other countries than
                    the so-called international prograthe question of what the program could do for
                    me sitting here in the middle of Zululand or wherever? Is this going to help me,
                    or what do I have to do to make sure I get some funds for my education program.
                    And if I support X in his position will he support me in mine.</p>

                        Kissinger-Nixon combination, or was the UN so peripheral to them that you
                        kind of went about your own business, or did you here, say,” The White House
                        needs this or that”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, I think, both of those. Somebody's always speaking in the name of
                    somebody in authority “The White House wants this,” or “OMB wants that,” or “The
                    VP's office wants this,” or Senator Whosis wants that. But I think with
                    Kissinger there was an advantage because he was not only involved with academia;
                    he was also involved with the real world. I think we benefited by having
                    Kissinger at the White House and then at State. He didn't want recommendations.
                    He said, “Let me make the decision, but give me sufficient information so that I
                    can have a reliable set of facts to base a decision upon. I want the pros and
                    cons. And if I have more questions on the pros and cons I will say, 'all right,
                    fill me in on those things.'" And it made a lot of us say, “Hey this is great,”
                    because unfortunately we had to try to guess what kind of a paper they wanted,
                    what answer are they looking for? So, you have the answer, and you develop the
                    question to meet the needs of the answer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were with UNESCO for '73-74-ish. Where did you
                        move after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: After that I moved over to the Civil Service Commission. When I was with the
                    Budgetary, Administrative and Planning part of IO, one of the areas in which I
                    became expert had to do with international salaries and emoluments. At that time
                    the Civil Service Commission was under the chairmanship of Bob Hampton with whom
                    I had worked when he was a member of the International Civil Service Advisory
                    Board (ICSAB), as his support person. He said, “Reuben, would you like to come
                    over and work with us for a couple of years on a special project?” And the
                    project was very exciting. It had to do with the total Federal compensation
                    package that they were redesigning and redeveloping. I said, Yes, it will be
                    something different, something I hadn't done in the domestic area since I had
                    worked with the State of New York. So I was detailed to the Civil Service for
                    two years, from '74 to '76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned there was an international flavor to
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>LEV: With the Civil Service, what I did bring over was the international flavor,
                    that is, dealing with the so-called emolument package: how do you pay a person
                    for living outside the country? or in the case of the Civil Service, a person
                    who is headquartered in San Diego and is temporarily transferred to Omaha. So my
                    experience with that problem was really very, very useful. You try to find a
                    specific base. Is the base where you work? And then, what does it cost to live
                    at the other post at the same level? It's similar to the Foreign Service, for
                    example, what do we have to pay a Foreign Service officer assigned to Paris in
                    order for him to maintain the standard of living he had in Washington, DC? And
                    this was done, but except on a domestic part. In the United States, living in
                    the northwest for example is living in a different world from Washington or in
                    New York. And one of the things we did for the Civil Service was develop
                    locality scales. We also developed what came to be the Senior Executive Service,
                    recommending a contract of two to three years which could be extended for a year
                    or more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were working with the Civil Service Commission,
                        did you run across petty dukes in various areas who had always run things in
                        Omaha this way, and “By God you're not going to mess with me”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Unfortunately, yes, and I think it goes back to the fact that, wherever you
                    have a bureaucracy, you're going to get the so-called 10 per cent. Some of them
                    were competent; some of them were incompetent. I think they had reached their
                    so-called “Peter Principle” and were operating under Murphy's Law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Peter Principle is you rise by promotion to a
                        state of incompetence, and therefore you are no longer promoted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LEV: That's right. But it goes a little bit beyond that, because the way we
                    looked at the old Peter Principle was that you were promoted to your level of
                    incompetency. Some of the people, just kept on going, and if in doubt they went
                    by the book; the Foreign Service people by the FAM (Foreign Affairs Manual). The
                    Civil Service people by the FPM (Federal Personnel Manual). The idea was that if
                    its not there, it doesn't exist. But this locality idea shook up everybody. We
                    had some problems with the congressional committee that handles the civil
                    service, and some of the staffers were saying: “You can't do this.” I said,
                    “Take a look around your table. You'll find that your congresspeople all come
                    from different parts of the country. Are you going to tell the congressperson
                    from New York, that his constituent, who is a civil servant, can't have more
                    money because he's living in New York?” So Congress was pretty receptive to the
                    idea until it came down to the budgetary crunch. There were other people who
                    said, “We've been doing it this way for years. We have one Civil Service; the
                    grade is from 1 to 18. It works. It's worked since 1849. Leave it alone. It
                    should not be tampered with - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.” But fortunately,
                    there were only a few and we did have support from the top, from the chairman of
                    the Civil Service Commission. He gave us what amounted to a blank check, to
                    carry out our general mandate to see what can be done to revise the government's
                    total salary-emolument package. We kept him pretty well in the loop. We had
                    conferences with him every week or once every two weeks, to fill him in. He had
                    assigned to us some excellent people, so things went comparatively smoothly. And
                    anytime we ran into a roadblock, we said, “The chairman has said....” and it
                    would melt away. There was one mistake, the appointment of somebody from a
                    consulting firm to be the overall leader of the band who was very, very
                    heavy-handed and just couldn't get involved with the bureaucracy. Since we knew
                    we were going to change the world of many of the senior civil service people we
                    had to use tender loving care. He came in like a roaring freight train, and he
                    knocked us back several months, and then the chairman contacted his firm and
                    they found another project for him. And that's when Bob put in one of his senior
                    people, and after that it was just very smooth.</p>

                        rather fascinating work with the Civil Service Commission. Where did you go
                        then?</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>LEV: I became the executive officer of the National Commission for the Observance
                    of International Woman's Year, which had been set up in 1975 in fulfillment of
                    the UN mandate that each of the member states was to establish a national
                    commission to carry out the objectives of the Decade of Women. In November of
                    1977 we had a very successful national conference of women in Houston. There
                    were about 15,000 including all of the First Ladies still livinBetty Ford,
                    Rosalynn Carter, and Lady Bird Johnson. Others included: Bella Abzug, Gloria
                    Steinem, Alan Alda, Helen Gurley Brown, the editor of one of the major
                    magazines. And we had people from academia and from everyday walks of life. Many
                    issues were debated including the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) which became a
                    major rallying point for many. I would argue that although years ago efforts to
                    pass a Constitutional amendment on child labor failed, today every state in the
                    union has very strong laws on the books dealing with child labor. And the thing
                    to do is go from state to state and find out what laws are discriminatory, and
                    then bring political clout to change them, mend them, throw them out, or bring
                    in new ones.</p>
                <p>Another issue was abortion on which there were solid forces on both sides. The
                    rights of prostitutes also came uthey wanted to be left alone, and they wanted
                    the right to carry on their business. Another important issue involved the
                    private sector and government support for day-care for the children of working
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: In my role as the executive officer I was responsible for making sure the
                    programs got going. I was also responsible for $5 million that Congress gave us.
                    What made that part easy was that they gave us a no-year appropriation, meaning
                    they gave us the money in '75, and the organization would finish in March or
                    April of '78. In '75 we had asked, I think, for 10 million and they gave us five
                    million. Senator Chuck Percy was instrumental in helping us get the bill through
                    the Senate and through his alliances and friends through the House of
                    Representatives. Although with the no-year appropriation we didn't have to
                    submit a request every year, but we still had to do the appropriate reporting to
                    the Office of Management and Budget. I also had to ensure that the monthly
                    meetings were properly run. For example, we were required by law to have all the
                    meetings taped. We also had to fund a site for the national convention; we
                    settled on Houston.</p>

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>LEV: No, the reason we ended up in Texas was that we had a division within the
                    Commission itself. Some wanted a state that was totally union, others wanted a
                    state that was not totally union. Texas was what I think it was called an “open”
                    state, if you want to join the union you can; if you don't want to join the
                    union you don't have to. So that's why they selected Texas. Plus, Houston did
                    come in with a better package for us also. We also had to deal with logistical
                    problems, finances, getting the report put together and printed, and provide
                    appropriate reporting to Congress and the OMB.</p>

                        because we're talking about dealing with approximately 51 per cent of the
                        population, which had become more and more restive because of really gross
                        discrimination. Some elements were extremely strident, and then there were
                        some very strong political cults to the right and to the left. And here you
                        are trying to manage this, I mean, a male representing a government which up
                        to then has been pretty discriminatory towards women. The very fact that
                        here you were, a male, in charge of this particular thinwas this a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I think at the beginning yes, because they didn't trust me. And for the same
                    reasons you're giving, that here he is, a male, and he's running the show, he's
                    got control of the money, the logistical operations, he can make or break it.
                    But at that time, Mildred Marcy was the director of the Commission, and working
                    with her was fantastic. Through Mildred's efforts we allayed the fears that I
                    was there as a spy. After that I was dubbed, in a loving sense, the “resident
                    Chauvinist.”</p>
                <p>But then we really settled down to work, and I think it became very, very
                    professional, so that the question of being a male never arose.</p>

                <p>LEV: There was one meeting about a very, very hot issue, and finally one of the
                    Commission members jumped up on the table, and she was about maybe four feet
                    five, and she was yelling at the top of her lungs, “Sisters, sisters, you're
                    behaving like men.” Everything came to a pregnant silence, and then they all
                    broke out into laughter. So when it comes to running meetings or developing
                    organizations or dealing with specific issues, I think it makes no difference
                    whether it's men or women. They had the same problem; they had the same
                    successes, as in an organization run by men. In both you have your grumps, your
                    gripes, you have to deal with the dynamics of how a meeting is run, who is your
                    official leader, who is the unofficial leader, who are the alpha cats and the
                    beta cats. We did have some very, very strong personalities, and I expected that
                    as a result there would be some sparks. There were, and the meetings were hot
                    and heavy. But again, it was brought back into the professional context: we are
                    here for a specific purpose. We were successful in developing and approving the
                    programs developed by the staff that I had pulled together. We had a staff of
                    about 60-65 people, most of them program officers putting together information.
                    There were also people who were helping the states develop their sub-national
                    state commissions. These in turn would elect delegates to go to the national
                    conference that was being planned for November 1977. And I was instrumental in
                    helping them get people together and organizing, and of course telling them how
                    much money we were able to give to each of these state organizations. But in
                    reality, these state organizations pulled the money together for their
                    delegates. And the number of delegates was based almost on how we elect
                    delegates to Congress, you know, by geographic distribution with one delegate
                    shall be for x-number of women in the state.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: I was certainly not a participant, but Reuben would come home, and he
                    was so excited by what the women were doing. Even though there were times when
                    he was very annoyed by the dissension, there was this sense of excitement about
                    something happening. I think that that excitement pervaded the conference, and I
                    think also that his sense of what was going on had something to do with their
                    acceptance of the fact that even though he was a male he was sharing their sense
                    of need and their sense of excitement. But I was not part of that other than
                    through what he would come home and say: “Hey, this was very exciting,” or this
                    was what was happening. And even the negative events that happened were
                    meaningful because, for the first time, there was an international podium, there
                    was mutual support and excitement over the Decade of the Woman. So he was
                    excited by what he was doing, and I knew that what was happening there was not
                    always going the way they would have liked it, but nonetheless, there was
                    movement forward, and I think the fact that so many states later adopted
                    elements of the ERA proposals was a factor. But through him I had a sense of the
                    excitement of the times. And I'm sure that was pervasive.</p>

                        American meeting, the one in Houston. This was an American meeting. Was this
                        the equivalent of ones being held in other countries in getting ready for
                        the international meeting? I would imagine issues in the American meeting
                        would be American issues, not dealing with female circumcision or that type
                        of thing?</hi>

                <p>LEV: There was some liaison with some of the Western national commissions, but
                    very, very little with the East dealing mostly with questions about the advance
                    of the program in a general sense. There was an international meeting of women
                    in I think it was Mexico City. It was a total fiasco because it imploded for
                    political reasonCuba was jumping up and down, the Western Bloc was trying to
                    impress the Eastern Bloc, and everybody impressed everybody, and nobody did
                    anything. And then there was another meeting within this same period, I think in
                    Copenhagen, which was the last international meeting of women. We sent our
                    national chair and one or two other people to that meeting which was much more
                    successful. It was less political than the one in Mexico City. From the feedback
                    I had gotten, many of the women expected that at Mexico City all women would
                    unite as one to go forward together. And then they found out the hard way that
                    each government had its own agenda on women's issues, and that cultures ran
                    very, very deep. What made Copenhagen somewhat more successful is that the
                    delegates recognized that they were dealing not only with all of the issues
                    affecting women, but also with the cultures involved going back thousands and
                    thousands of years. So in Copenhagen our delegates understood that, and tried to
                    deal with issues that could be dealt with internationally.</p>

                        aware of, or was the government's role simply to help this group, which was
                        non-governmental, have a good meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I don't remember any pressure to present the U.S. point of view. The U.S.
                    point of view was that we're abiding by the UN resolution to establish a
                    national commission which was to have meetings, make proposals and
                    recommendations. The political issues came from outside the governmenpeople like
                    Phyllis Schlafly, the pro-lifers, the anti-lifers. The private sector was very,
                    very concerned about the impact on their profits if they were required to set up
                    day care centers. Some of the manufacturers of women's garments who worried if
                    women aren't going to wear bras, what are we going to sell? You're going to put
                    people out of work. As silly as it sounds, that actually did happen.</p>

                <p>LEV: The meeting, I felt, was a success. The three first ladies kept things
                    tempered. We had a very, very strong agenda. They met the timetable and all the
                    agenda was successfully dealt with. Each of the commissions at the state level
                    were going to go back to their capitals and start lobbying for changing laws or
                    amending laws. There would also be informal assistancthat if someone in New
                    Jersey needed help from somebody in New York, the people in New York would help
                    New Jersey do lobbying. I think they surprised themselves. About 15,000 people
                    attended and there were about 1,000 delegates.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much dealing with Bella Abzug, because she
                        was from your home town and was a renowned, very aggressive congresswoman,
                        who did not hide her light under a bushel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Bella was a very, very astute politician, but she only made one mistake,
                    which was to run against Moynihan for the Senate seat. And the second mistake
                    she made was to be one of five candidates to run in the Democratic primary for
                    the mayor of New York. But when you knew her in the real world, she was a very,
                    very bright, dynamic lady, and she did have very pretty brown hair under that
                    hat. We had many meetings with Bella, who was the deputy commissioner, and with
                    Mildred, to discuss strategies and things like that. She was very astute. She
                    knew what she wanted. She had been responsible, when she was in Congress, for
                    the passage of the “Sunshine Law,” and the “Sunset Law,” providing that when a
                    program is completed the unspent money must go back to the Treasury. And our
                    surplus did go back to the treasury; I think out of my $5 million I was able to
                    give back $650,000-750,000. We ran a very economical group, but we weren't
                    penny-wise and dollar-foolish. Bella was a solid lady, delightful to work with.
                    She would drive you up the wall because she had her own ideas, but she wasn't
                    the way she was presented by the press. Gloria Steinem was also very, very
                    helpful in maintaining a balance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEV: We wrapped up shop in about March or April of 1978, closed the books on IWY.
                    Then a very good friend of mine, Ralph Eye, who was at that time in the Bureau
                    of Cultural Affairs involved me in a White House plan to combine State's Bureau
                    of Cultural Affairs with USIA to form the International Communications Agency
                    (ICA). And I became part of this new organization, and the effort to blend the
                    two groups. Alice Ilchman became director of the ECA, the Educational and
                    Cultural Affairs Division of the ICA. I worked with John Shumate, who was the
                    director for administration, as one of the officers who was trying to help him
                    mesh the USIA culture and the State Department culture. And then I became an
                    instant expert in dealing with the book program with which I had not been
                    familiar. I discovered that sending books to our libraries involved a very
                    active review process. And my question was, why do we have this other than
                    making sure that a book is not offensive to a culture? And then I went to New
                    York and took a look at our warehouse, and we had books galore. And I said,
                    “What do we need this for?” because many of the publishers would be very, very
                    happy to send us copies of books that they felt would be of use to the library,
                    not that they were going to advance education, but from a commercial point of
                    view. So I was involved with writing a report that established a process to make
                    sure not only that the books were not offensive but would serve a purpose,
                    whether with a negative or a positive view of the United States.</p>

                        there's the practice during the McCarthy period when they were yanking books
                        out under no particular standards. I can understand that you have to worry
                        about a culture. But what about the United States? I mean a good half the
                        books published are sort of slamming the United States or American culture.
                        Coming from the academic world with writers, left, right, and center. Were
                        we involved in that? Did it make any difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Oh, it did make a difference for one reason, which is that because we are an
                    open society, they don't need us. I mean, the books are there, the books are on
                    the shelves, and their own embassy people who would have the counterpart of a
                    cultural affairs officer, all he has to do is go down to the local Brentano's or
                    Barnes and Nobel, and you can find books that are pro-U.S., anti-U.S., and on
                    any issue. It's not that we were controlling it. The stuff was available. It's
                    just a matter of having a better access for these governments that when we
                    establish the libraries within the binational centers or within the USIA
                    libraries in all of these countries they can go in and do research on a project
                    knowing full well that they're going to get all sides covered in dealing with
                    specific issues. So the open societI mean, it was there. They didn't need us.
                    And of course the paperbacks, and then in England you had the headquarters for
                    Penguin and the Oxford Press. So the stuff was available, and it overcame what I
                    thinand I agree with you totallwas an embarrassing period of timI mean the
                    McCarthy era. It was stupidity carried to the nth degree, but the materials were
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any drive to have somebody sitting, and saying,

                </p>
                <p>LEV: I think the program, when I got involved in it, '78-80, was a carryover from
                    the McCarthy era. We did have this, I wouldn't call it censorship per se, but we
                    did have people who were reviewing these books and using their own judgement on
                    whether they were appropriate for our libraries. When I did mention it, I said,
                    “These guys can go out and get these books anyway.” When it was argued, “We
                    don't have to feed the fire.” I said, “You're not feeding a fire. Let them read
                    it, but make sure that you have another book that deals with the same issue
                    whether from the right or the left and let them make the decision.”</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>LEV: Not quite. The binational centers reviewed recommendations about what not to
                    take and what to take. If there was something that they wanted, and somebody
                    back in Washington thought they shouldn't have it, then something would get lost
                    in the mail or “I'm sorry, your airgram got lost” or “We don't think that there
                    are sufficient copies of the book to go around.” I mean any excuse served. So
                    there was a sort of a subtle way of telling the BNC what you could have and what
                    you couldn't have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But essentially we did cut out books, while you were

                <p>LEV: There was this extra layer of book review. And that was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about book review, it means essentially
                        censorship. It has to, I mean, otherwise why would you review a book?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I think the only review finally did evolve down to the point of making sure
                    that the books wouldn't go out with certain types of pictures or languagHenry
                    Miller books for example, Steinbeck, or Hemingway. But it was fine. And then in
                    Moscow they were really surprised that they had some good solid books there
                    dealing with America, and one of the things that we had problems with, that we
                    heard from our USIA people there in Moscow was that, Hey, you guys really are
                    pushing something. We had a copy of the Soviet Constitution, and many people
                    came in there to read it, and they were absolutely shocked because technically,
                    the Soviet Constitution was more liberal than the American Constitution.</p>

                        are all sorts of rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: And they used our Constitution as the base. But they never had access to it,
                    so the Soviet academics came in, and wow, did they start a furor, so it was
                    great. So it was little things like that. We did get out, dig in, and said,
                    “We're not doing anything. This is an official Soviet document.” But we don't
                    have it in our libraries because we don't think it's appropriate. But it was
                    there. So there was some left-handed humor that we enjoyed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LEV: Originally it was supposed to be the Communications International Agency,
                    CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but this was a Carter innovation which died very

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>LEV: Fortunately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIA and State. How did you find these two cultures were
                        working together? They had been running exchanges, in a way, jointly,
                        because the USIA people abroad, USIS, were picking who would be exchanged,
                        and then the process was carried out in State. It was a peculiar operation,
                        so it made sense to put them together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: There were some real diehards, saying: “State, you don't understand us.” And
                    State would say, “USIA, you don't understand us.” But fortunately the people in
                    the middle ranks, the guys in the trenches, were what made this go. From an
                    administrative and managerial point of vieand even from a substantive point of
                    viethe move was successful and was workinthe exchange program, the Fulbright
                    Program, the book program, support of the libraries. Support of USIA programs
                    out in the field came from a more vociferous member of the country team at
                    embassies because many of the USIA types were the PAO, the public affairs
                    officers. Many of the PAOs were concerned because the ambassador could send a
                    note back to the director of USIA, “This guy is no good,” and there goes his
                    careeagain, the rating system sort of got involved. But the meshing of the
                    groups, I think, worked out very well. I think what helped it was that you just
                    had to work together, and otherwise the whole thing would just fall flat on its
                    face. And it was successful, again, from the ICA point of view, with our
                    exchange program. Everything went over lock, stock, and barrel, so it made it
                    easy. You still had the same people doing the same thing, where duties,
                    responsibilities, programs, objectives didn't change; the only thing that
                    changed was the letterhead.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of ICA in those days? Was it
                        Reinhardt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Yes. John Reinhardt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, I mean, that didn't change things particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: No, he was happy that things were moving the way they were. And again, Alice
                    Ilchman was the one that handled the ECA part of it, and it turned out that from
                    a political point of vieI think she was the daughter of a former secretary of
                    the Treasury or somebody who had worked in the Federal Reserve Systeshe was a
                    bright, dynamic lady, and we were lucky, I guess, to have good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a difference in the ICA people and the State

                <p>LEV: I found that they were basically the same. The people were okay. They had
                    their little quirks. “This is not the way we did it,” and then we'd say, “Hey,
                    guys, we didn't do it that way; however, this is the way we're going to do it
                    now.” I think it's a natural instinct. “I'm so comfortable, why are you taking
                    away my shoes?” kind of a thing. But, they did work together professionally. I
                    think the mistake at that time was the separation between the FSIO (Foreign
                    Service information officer) and the FSO, so there was some animosity, I think,
                    on a one-to-one basis. But overall, I think it worked out very well.</p>

                <p>LEV: 1980 to 1983. I was assigned as international administrations officer. I was
                    responsible for what they called the Civil Budget Committee where I was the U.S.
                    representative (rep). I was also the U.S. rep on the Coordinating Committee of
                    Government Experts, which dealt with administration and budgetary policies for
                    NATO and for other international organizations co-located in Europe, such as the
                    European Union, the European Patent Office, and the European Space Agency.
                    Because I was the only one in the mission who knew how to deal with the issues,
                    I was able to develop my own policiewith approval, of course, from EUR/RPE. And
                    it worked out very well. It was very exciting; in an embassy you're working
                    one-on-one with someone in a specific ministry; here I was working with 15 other
                    counterparts. It led to some fascinating give and take; we all had to give, and
                    we all had to take. I also established an informal group of five consisting of
                    representativeall senior bureaucratof Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and
                    France, the major contributors at that time to NATO. We just compared notes on
                    the areas of interest to one or the other of us and where we needed support of
                    others in proposing a particular national policy, whether concerning
                    international operations or personnel administration or the budget. And whatever
                    the Five decided, the other eleven followed suit. I was the only member of a
                    diplomatic service. The others came out of their civilian ministries.</p>
                <p>I also got involved with terrorism. I was sort of an adjunct to NATO's Special
                    Committee concerned with how each of the member states was dealing with
                    terrorism. At that time it was comparatively quiet. But while I was there, there
                    were several attacks by terrorists, most of them of North African descent.
                    Belgium itself, I think, was an excellent place to be. It drove Marilyn crazy
                    because the so-called “eight-to-five” hours, were nonexistent, and work on the
                    weekends, of course. One day we had to wake up the ambassador at about four
                    o'clock in the morning when a telegram informed us that the U.S. is going to
                    announce that we have a neutron bomb that will kill people but not destroy
                    property. And then our poor fellows in USIA had to do quite a bit of political
                    wordsmithing and to say it's not all that bad. But it came out at the wrong time
                    because in 1982-83, that's when the Marine building in Lebanon was blown up. And
                    there were a couple of other terrorist activities involving Lebanon, and a few
                    of our embassies got hit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: At that time it was Tap Bennett, and I had the good fortune to serve with
                    Tap for the full three years that he was there. I think he finished up his tour
                    about the same time I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he interested in what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LEV: He was very interested in it. He was a fascinating man. He knew what was
                    going on and he was interested in what was going on. During the morning
                    meetings, the equivalent of the country team meetings, we all had to report on
                    what we were doing. If something struck him, he would say, “I want you to see my
                    secretary and make an appointment for x o'clock. I want to go into greater
                    depth.” He was very interested in the administration of international
                    organizations and NATO: Were we getting economies of scale? Were we really
                    getting our money's worth? Were these people really doing what they're supposed
                    to be doing? And he was a people-oriented ambassador, which made it somewhat
                    easier for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came to NATO, were you getting suggestions in the
                        corridor or anywhere else of concern that the administration wasn't doing
                        too well? Questions about how well the organization was being administered,
                        and whether we were getting our money's worth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, this was one of the responsibilities of the Coordinating Committee of
                    Government Experts. Each of the 16 member states had representatives on this
                    group which was supposed to make sure that we were truly getting the value of
                    what we were contributing. Plus, there was an independent body of auditors
                    consisting of five or six members from each major contributor. The U.S. member
                    headed the group, and I dealt quite a bit with him. He had a problem with the
                    others. It was a matter of auditing techniques. Their approach was that if you
                    spend a dollar on pencils, show me the pencils. And our view was, we spent a
                    dollar on pencils, however, were all these pencils really necessary? Our
                    approach was to determine whether a given action was necessary. Is this item
                    necessary? Are additional people really required to perform XYZ functions? Where
                    the others were more straitlaced in determining when you spend something, show
                    me the receipt. When you go to a gas station, and you put in for mileage, show
                    me the receipt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was more a straight auditing rather than an efficiency
                        test.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I guess that would be it. Quality control was the approach we pushed. By the
                    time I left they were starting to more in that direction, and the U.S. auditor
                    and I were very successful in persuading the others that auditing is not only
                    counting pencils but also examining necessity and quality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you find that on the whole, was there a major
                        problem with NATO, or was it rather working with an operating system that
                        wasn't out of control?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>LEV: It wasn't out of control. It helped that there were then only 16 states. It
                    worked very, very well, in comparison to the UN. There was a common goal, a
                    specific purpose, as opposed to the UN's more generalized objective. And the
                    experts working on NATO affairs all had specific programs to deal with.</p>
                <p>One of the developments at NATwhile I was there and in which I had a haninvolved
                    civilian programs. This was unusual; the usual concerns were with weapons,
                    tactics, oil reserves and so forth. Under this civilian program, Science for
                    Stability, the Southern Tier countrieat that time it was Greece, Turkey, and I
                    believe Portugawere helped to develop graduate courses in international affairs
                    and science. There was some opposition among NATO members. Somebody said it was
                    “Science for Stupidbility.” But supporterthe British, Dutch, and the U.S.
                    prevailed. It was inexpensive $5 million for three years. Members sent
                    educational experts to help develop graduate courses in science and
                    international affairs. So we were successful in that. There was also a committee
                    on modern society, which helped members develop NATO infrastructure including
                    common road signs and driver's tests. Belgium at that time was either the first
                    or the second in the world in automobile-caused deaths. Everything had to be
                    decided by consensus, so diplomatic skills were important. It was almost like
                    playing Monopoly, I'll give you Boardwalk for two railroads. At times it did end
                    up with horse trading. But in my little group of five we understood the problems
                    the members were facing at their own ministries, so we were able to work things
                    out before we got into formal conferences and council meetings. There was no
                    bloodletting or questions of who did what to whom. I'm sure it's been your
                    experience that when you hear about communiqu�s that they are developed long
                    before the leaders ever meet. And the communiqu� itself is a matter of give and
                    take and negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, that's where the negotiations go on. Well, now,
                        tell me, as you were dealing with this, what were the characteristics of
                        some of the groups that you dealt with? I'm sure somebody could say, “Well,
                        that Lev was very American, and he said such and so and worked in such and
                        such a way.” Let's talk about some of these, the French for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: By this time, the French were technically not involved with the military,
                    but they stayed in what they regarded as the civilian, dealing for example with
                    the non-military infrastructure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the French delegate in your committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>LEV: The French delegate was a fascinating person. He was a member of their
                    diplomatic service. Unfortunately, he didn't have enough training in dealing
                    with people. I believe he was a consular officer, which surprised me, because
                    consular activity, day to day, is with people. But he was from somewhere behind
                    the scenes, and either he had a problem understanding what NATO was about, or
                    his instructions were fuzzy. But when he was replaced in 1981, and succeeded by
                    a woman, things turned around 180 degrees. Working with her, we had a better
                    understanding of the problems she faced with getting certain proposals across or
                    supporting a U.S. initiative or a Dutch initiative or a German initiative. So
                    the French all in all were very, very much involved and after her assignment
                    there were no real arguments or battles. We all understood where we were, what
                    the limits were from a budgetary point of view. We all knew what we wanted from
                    the infrastructure, what we wanted the NATO infrastructure to do for us as a
                    whole, and how we could improve its operations. Could we streamline it any more?
                    Could we bring in more electronic support, whether it was moving away from the
                    electronic typewriter to bringing in computers? There was some opposition to
                    computers. But about '81-82 we started to bring in computers, and in 1983 we
                    were all finally hooked up to a mainframe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Germans? How did you find the
                        German representative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: The German, Karlheinz Karl was a fascinating man. He was from their Ministry
                    of the Treasury, and working with him was no problem. He would look at me, and I
                    would look at him, and he knew I was Jewish, and he understood what the
                    situation was from 1933 to 1945, but we had an excellent working relationship.
                    We also had a wonderful personal relationship with him and his wife. His wife, I
                    believe, was a pediatrician.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: She was a brilliant lady.</p>
                <p>LEV: A brilliant lady, and it worked out well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you've said, it sounded like the Dutch
                        representative was sort of a spark plug there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>LEV: Robert Smits. He wasn't exactly a spark plug. I think he would act as a
                    mediator if thought that things weren't going the way they should be or if
                    everyone was starting to sing together and then somebody was off key. He would
                    say, bring in the bass and bring in the sopranos. He was from the Treasury
                    Ministry detailed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was also a lawyer and a
                    colonel, and part of the queen's front office. So he felt that he was
                    responsible for helping things along. But I think it was almost like a
                    five-cylinder Audi: all of the five cylinders worked together. There were
                    difficult days, as in everybody's life. But basically we all had a feeling for
                    each other. There was not only a working relationship but also a personal one
                    and deep friendships developed. Even after all these years, we're still in touch
                    with some of them. It was an unusual group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '80-83, what was the feeling about the “Soviet menace”
                        at that point, because, as you know, it waxes and wanes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, at that time we felt the threat was very, very real. And then we also
                    believed at that time that they were the ones that were funding the mess in the
                    Mideast, that they were behind the bombing of the Marine barracks and the
                    terrorist groups that were wandering around Western Europe. The feeling was that
                    if it came to a military showdown the two sides were in balance because we all
                    had the bomb and other capabilities. So everybody was concerned, we all felt the
                    threat was real. There was constant debate going on within NATO about what do we
                    do if an atom bomb hits, how do we prepare? Do we dig deeper down into a Maginot
                    Line, or do we send airplanes up?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course we had the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in
                        December of '79. Did you get any repercussions during this early period from
                        our hostage situation in Iran? Was that a major concern or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: It was a concern, but I think the general feeling was that it was an
                    isolated situation reflecting that the Iranians, feeling their muscles, were
                    taking on what they called the Great Satan. And that if there were to be any
                    kidnapping of any NATO member it would be in order to extort money. There was an
                    incident where a terrorist shot a bazooka at one of the U.S. generals, but
                    fortunately the general was in a well armored Mercedes, and all they ended up
                    with was broken glass. The attack was traced to Soviet-supported East German
                    terrorist groups that had gotten into West Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the terrorism side, did you feel that any of the
                        members were a bit soft on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>LEV: Well, one of the things that we were concerned about was the attitude of the
                    Belgians. The Belgians felt that they had an unwritten agreement to provide
                    “safe haven,” in exchange for good behavior in Belgium. But then terrorists
                    started to shoot up of synagogues and private offices and to take hostages. I
                    think then the Belgians realized that terrorists don't play by the book. So the
                    soft attitudes at that time became very, very hard locally. At that time Belgium
                    was the only so-called soft spot. Everybody else was in the real world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course the Germans had the Bader-Meinhof, the
                        Italians had the Red Brigades, and the French had the Charles Martel Group,
                        so they had been inoculated against this complacency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: As far as personal security itself is concerned, we worked very, very
                    closely with the security folks at the various embassies. The American security
                    officer was Greg Bujack, who was a real expert whose views had great weight. He
                    strongly recommended that those living outside the so-called international
                    compound, which was basically at Waterloo, secure their houses with appropriate
                    types of locks and have bars on their windows. He said you can never protect 100
                    per cent, but improve what you have now. He dealt with the entire American
                    diplomatic family, which included the embassy, those of us at USNATO, and the
                    representative to the European Community. We also exchanged with the other NATO
                    members. It was to make sure that we all were as secure as security would
                    permit. There was some argument about how to deal with NATO security. We were
                    right near the international airport, and a plant manufacturing the Lada, the
                    Russian equivalent of the Fiat. We'd drive by this Lada plant, and you'd see
                    antennas galore. This had its positive aspects because NATO was able to jam the
                    transmitters or intercept their messages. But there was concern, for example,
                    that a pickup truck could stop outside NATO with an 80 millimeter mortar, throw
                    in about five mortar shells in about 10 seconds, and flee down the road. So
                    steps were taken to prevent cars from stopping and for the first time guards
                    patrolled with their FN rifles off-safety and loaded and ready to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '83 you moved on. To where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>LEV: In '83 I came back to the Bureau of International Organization Affairs as
                    director of international recruitment. I was in that position for three years,
                    during which I developed a database and brought in the computer. I had a
                    consultant, Bob Allen, a retired Foreign Service officer, who helped me
                    establish a program to encourage international organizations to hire more
                    American citizens. Technically each organization is supposed to hire a certain
                    per cent of its staff from each of the member states. But with 130 countries,
                    it's a difficult calculation. My job was to get a fair share of Americans and at
                    the same time to make sure that we had highly qualified candidates whose
                    qualifications could not be challenged. We were comparatively successful and I
                    had the complete support of my assistant secretaries, first Greg Newell, and
                    then Alan Keyes; both of whom took the opportunity at meetings to bring up the
                    question of American staff representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel at all, when you were with United Nations
                        Affairs, the basic distaste that at least the early Reagan Administration
                        had towards the United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, it goes back before then, as we questioned what return we were getting
                    for our contribution. One of the problems we had was the absence of any real
                    administrative oversight in the UN. It was a matter of Parkinson's Law. If there
                    was a vacancy, it was simply filled. And it just kept snowballing, and the UN
                    became a very top-heavy organization, not for administrative, but basically for
                    political reasons. Every member had to have somebody in a senior position, and
                    of course this would be a retired foreign minister or other minister or a
                    high-level friend of somebody who knew somebody else. As a result the UN was not
                    designed to be administratively functional from a managerial and quality
                    perspective. We had been fighting for years to change this, and one of the
                    things I had got involved in was reducing the budgetary reliance of the
                    organization on the U.S. We were successful in reducing the assessment from
                    about 31 per cent down to 25 per cent. And by taking advantage of additional
                    funds as new members came in, we went from 25 to 24.2. I know.8 percent doesn't
                    sound like much, but when you're dealing with multi-million-dollar budgets it
                    does add up. But in the UN we didn't get the support for our position so we're
                    now behind the ball by billions of dollars. But from an administrative point of
                    view, at that time, '83 to '86, things were improving.</p>
                <p>We were also looking at the other international organizations. We said, “If you
                    don't shape up, we're going to pull out.” And everybody laughed at us. Then we
                    pulled out of UNESCO because of M'Bow's mismanagement. But we still participated
                    in those activities of UNESCO that were really of concern to the U.S. from a
                    policy point of view. While we pulled out of the administrative and plenary
                    side, we still retained a very good foothold in some of the organization's
                    activities. It turned out that the Brits followed us. We were also threatening
                    to pull out of the ILO, but the ILO came around with administrative
                    improvements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you develop lists of qualified people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>LEV: It was very easy. We sent out announcements to other U.S. agencies; for
                    example, if the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna needed
                    scientists or biologists or whatever with specific types of background, it was
                    easy enough to go to the Department of Energy or DOD or also to some of the
                    scientific think tanks. We even got in touch with Brookings. We asked
                    universities if they were willing to second a professor emeritus in chemistry to
                    the IAEA. It was the same thing with the World Health Organization. That part
                    was very easy and it was also very exciting, to meet these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the hand of politics reaching in? Did we
                        worry about the Indians putting in too many people from the Congress Party?
                        Somehow I find it difficult to think that, with people like Alan Keyes and
                        Greg Newell, we were a benign organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Oh, far from it. In fact, it led to some very interesting morning meetings,
                    and one of the things was that you had the American Heritage group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a conservative group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Yes. Alan was very, very popular with them and wanted to bring in some
                    people who I think would have been destructive. They also started to offer up
                    people who did have the appropriate qualifications. But political pressure on
                    appointments came not only from Alan or Greg but it from the Hill. You had to
                    play the political game, there was no doubt. But we did have some excellent
                    people that came to us through the political process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how Alan Keyes operated? He
                        keeps running for President. I've heard not the most laudatory comments from
                        people who worked with hithat he was more inclined to lecture and to talk
                        than to perform.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I found Alan a very, very bright individual. I mean he was sharp. He knew
                    what he wanted, but part of the problem with Alan at that time at least was that
                    he did not surround himself with good, solid people. And this is what any
                    politician, or even a good lecturer, needa good solid support system to provide
                    information and avoid doing or saying things that, in effect, will work against
                    you. For example, I read in the paper the other day that Alan's PR person was
                    having an argument with one of the talk show hosts.</p>
                <p>Mrs. LEV: Jay Leno.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>LEV: With Jay Leno. I think, maybe Alan has failed to surround himself with good
                    solid people. They're all dedicated to him, and Alan knows what he wants to do,
                    but I'm not quite sure he knows how to get there. He does have a following, but
                    a run for President I think is going to be difficult, as we saw even for his run
                    for the nomination for senator from his state. He had a tendency to lecture, but
                    he was also a good listener, and followed up with good questions. So you had to
                    be well-prepared to defend your position and proposals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you run afoul of any particular problems on the
                        political side? I mean, somebody came and said, this brand-new Swarthmore
                        graduate wasn't going to get a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I don't remember anything of that kind. We had developed a beautiful
                    boiler-plate letter explaining to applicants the process involved in
                    international organization hiring. And I think the complexity of this scared
                    them away. But if we felt we had a good possibility of getting one of the
                    youngsters as an intern we'd grab him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, '86 you moved on, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: In 1987 I worked at FSI helping Pru Bushnell and Judy Kaufmann develop a
                    course and briefing book for deputy chiefs of mission. I also did some lecturing
                    for them. I went out to the woods, which was nice, and did lecturing there to
                    various groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been around a while. What were some of the
                        qualifications you felt a deputy chief of mission should know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, since the DCM is the equivalent of an executive officer on board ship,
                    he had better be oriented toward people, especially his own, and know how to
                    keep people working for him. How do you retain their loyalty? How do you write a
                    report on an officer that will help him in the competition for promotion? And so
                    we emphasized personnel administration, personnel management, and quality
                    control. We emphasized also his responsibility to the ambassadoif the ambassador
                    needs him, he has to be there. He has his economic man, his political man; he
                    has to be his point man in dealing with ministry activities. And, of course, pay
                    and emoluments are important. So it is important to make sure that he is taken
                    care of, in a positive sense. If you have a happy DCM, usually you have a happy
                    embassy. If you get a DCM who's grumpy and grouchy it passes on down.</p>

                    had gone up through the ranks together, and I knew that some of these guys were
                    excellent, having worked with them. And then when they went overseas, they
                    continued in that vein; they were low-key, very sharp, very bright, knew what
                    buttons to push, when to push them, how to deal with ambassadors, how to deal
                    with their staff, how to deal with Washington, with their Desk officers. So I
                    knew the guys that I did meet and maybe it was just unusual, but they were
                    fantastic. Al La Porta was one of them. He was on his way back to Indonesia and
                    just recently went out now as ambassador to Mongolia. But they were good-quality
                    appointments. None of them were political. They were all from the ranks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, in '87, where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: From '87 until I retired on September 30, 1988, I was the acting director of
                    IO's UN Systems Management and Budget Office where I was helping develop the
                    budget, dealing with the Hill on the deficit, dealing with the Administration,
                    with members of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, the Senate and House
                    Finance Committees, and trying to get money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I haven't been following this closely, but since the
                        time you're talking about, we haven't been paying what we owe to the UN,
                        which has always struck me as being, not only cheap, but also irresponsible.
                        Could you talk about at this time, when you were close to this problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: At that time, '87-88, one of the problems we had was that the UN
                    administration was not being responsive, not only to the U.S. but also to the
                    needs of other delegations. And one of the ways of getting them to hear us was
                    to say we're not going to pay up in full. We're just going to pay enough to make
                    sure we don't lose the vote. The rule is that a nation loses its vote if it is
                    in arrears for more than the equivalent of two years. So at that time we were in
                    comparatively good shape as far as losing our vote, but we did have arguments on
                    the Hill that by doing this we were shooting ourselves in the foot because we
                    were losing clout, not necessarily with the UN organization itself but with
                    other member states who would argue that if we weren't paying our share they
                    didn't need to support us on positions or policy. So in my opinion, it was
                    counterproductive but we couldn't convince the Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the staffs of the Senate and the House
                        of Representatives understood the position but parroted their masters? Or
                        how did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>LEV: The staffers always say that my boss wants this, my boss wants that. But I
                    have a feeling that many of these people come in with their own agenda and are
                    able to influence the actions of the elected representative. They understood
                    what our presentations which were in good, old-fashioned English. The easy part
                    was to present the numbers; if we don't pay this, we don't pay that, this is
                    what's going to happen. And we did point out the counter-productivity of doing
                    what they were doing. But they're more receptive to what's happening in with
                    their own constituency where the role of the UN is not important or understood.
                    The staffers were good, they were sharp. But they had their own agenda. No
                    matter what we could do, their minds were set. When you're dealing with people
                    like the good old senator from North Carolina,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Jesse Helms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Yes, Jesse Helmthey have their way of doing things. Today, after 18 months,
                    we finally have an ambassador up at the UN, it didn't help our situation, not to
                    have one. Some of my colleagues have said that we lost representation on some
                    very, very important administrative committees in the UN. For the first time in
                    memory there is no American representative on the Committee on Administrative
                    and Budgetary Questionand that is a very key committee which reviews all of the
                    Secretariat's budgetary inputs and presents them to the Secretary General. We
                    also have a key American, John Fox, who's a member of the Joint Inspection Unit
                    in Geneva and they may not request renewal of his appointment. So we may be
                    losing some very, very key positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reading at this timwe're talking about
                        '87-8of Jesse Helms and his staff, and who was doing what within that
                        particular group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, the reading since then hasn't changed much. From an administrative
                    point of view, the UN is run no better or no worse than Congress. No
                    international organization has been set up to run as a truly functioning
                    quality-controlled organization. There's too much politics involved. You're
                    dealing with 130 and 140 counterparts, and they are all of equal stature in the
                    General Assembly. Whether you're the United States or you're Zambieach one has a
                    vote. And each gets clout from being a member of a block. The U.S. has lost that
                    clout while Africans get together, the West Europeans get together, the Latin
                    Americans get together. When you five fingers together you have a very strong
                    fist. And I'm not quite sure what Senator Helms has been shooting at. He feels
                    that administratively the UN is a mess. But I've worked with the UN staff, and
                    some of these people are really top-notch. At times they find themselves
                    hindered from the top as we do, a top-heavy bureaucracy can sit on really solid
                    people. The people working within the UN or any of the international
                    organizations are good, but it's a matter of getting them unfettered so they can
                    do what they're supposed to be doing. But there are so many orders coming from
                    various directions, whether from the hierarchy within the organization or
                    informally through the back door or some other route.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>So it's not the quality of the people; it's the amount of pressure that's brought
                    to bear on these people. The pressure comes from various sources. It's not that
                    they're an administrative mess; it's the pressures that are brought to bear on
                    them from various sources. It's the same thing within the U.S. Government itself
                    or the State Department. We have pressure from all over the lot, whether you're
                    overseayou know we have our CODELs and everything comes to a screeching haland I
                    remember what we went through when we finally got the money to build up the
                    campus here (and much to our surprise we did get the money) or the establishment
                    of the diplomatic security bureau. It's easy to deal with this because its
                    within the U.S., but when you're dealing with the UN and international
                    organizations, you're dealing with 100 plus, and NATO is now 18 plus. So
                    administratively I think they're doing a comparatively good job considering the
                    pressures that are being brought to bear on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that there was somebody on Jesse
                        Helms' staff who was calling the shots, or was it Jesse Helms? Because this
                        is such an important thing, I'm trying to capture that particular time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, the feeling I had was that it was Jesse and maybe one or two of his
                    staff, perhaps his chief of staff. Here we are in a democracy, but yet you get
                    one senator who's elected by 100,000 people, who can bring the country to a
                    screeching halt. And this is exactly what he's done as far as some key
                    appointments are concerned. Some of Clinton's nominees, like those of any other
                    president, are not knights in shining armor, but holding Holbrooke up for 18
                    months </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the ambassadorship to the UN.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: To the UN was really stupid. And Helms held up a lot of other ambassadors
                    back then too because he wanted A and Y, and
                    you're-not-going-to-get-this-person-unless-I-get-what-I-want kind of a
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to touch on it, what did you do after you
                        retired in 1988?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: I became an assistant professor of business management at Trinity College,
                    an all-girl Catholic College here in Washington, DC. After a year I became the
                    chair and I stayed there for five years. I was also able to get a couple of
                    other retirees some adjunct positions with Trinity College and other colleges
                    elsewhere. Then in '93 I was asked by ACTA, if I'd be willing to come out of
                    retirement and have my name up for the position of director of administration
                    for a new organization to implement the treaty for the Prohibition of Chemical
                    Weapons. I was there for the two years '93-95, participating in getting a new
                    organization off the boards.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this organization trying to do? I mean, I think
                        the title tells it, but what was the situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: At that time we were still called the Provisional Technical Secretariat
                    because we needed 65 of the 120 signatories to the treaty to ratify it for the
                    organization to become fully effective. Everybody had to sign an agreement, it
                    was a matter for each of these countries to go back to their respective
                    legislatures to agree with the treaty and to become signatories. And when the
                    65th signatory comes in, the treaty automatically goes into effect. Among the
                    treaty's important provisions was one banning chemical weapons and calling for a
                    team of inspectors enjoying full oversight and full freedom of access to the
                    signatories, to make sure that the chemicals used for peaceful purposes, even to
                    make aspirin, are not diverted to make something else.</p>
                <p>So we started out with what we called the “dirty dozen.” It was about 13 or 14.
                    And when I left it was 150. Now I think they're at a staffing now of about 350,
                    which includes inspectors and staff for a training facility. So it was a very
                    exciting time, very hard, but gratifying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was a lot of pressure on us because weren't
                        chemical weapons considered to be the poor country's nuclear weapon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Well, that was it, but, even Iran is a signatory to it. Iraq no. Some of the
                    nasties are not members. Maybe they have joined since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Libya, I take it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: Libya is one; Iraq is another; and there may be a few others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: North Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: It doesn't take much, but at least, they have to get their chemicals from
                    someplace, so the treaty would hopefully more or less control those countries
                    that produce the specific chemicals, if it's going to be for fertilizer, let it
                    be fertilizer, if it's going to be cosmetics, let it be for cosmetics. With the
                    bombing of Khartoum in the Sudan we'll never know what the story was, but it was
                    said that they were making components for chemical weapons.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>One of the problems they had here in the States and in many of the other
                    industrial nations is that you get some inspector from Lower Slobovia or
                    someplace, who would come in and steal secretyou know, industrial espionagand
                    this is what a lot of companies were concerned about. So a system was
                    established that enabled the company that was visited to review the notes that
                    were taken to make sure that their commercial interests were protected. And as a
                    result the U.S. ratified the treaty in April of '96, I think it was. The gas
                    incident in Tokyo drove a number of members to become signatories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sarin or something. It was some sort of a religious
                        group in Japan that put sarin into the subway system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: That was it, and they injured a lot of people and there were some deaths.
                    But I think you hit it on the head. Chemicals are the poor man's atom bomneutron
                    bomb, really. And how you stop that I don't know, but at least we do have an
                    organization to put some sort of control over it. The level of success will be
                    up to the participants themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the organization tied to the United Nations or
                        separate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEV: No, it's a separate international organization.</p>
