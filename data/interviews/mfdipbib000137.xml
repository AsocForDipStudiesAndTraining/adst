                <p>ROGER C. BREWIN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 9, 1990</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us an idea of your background to start
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: I was raised in Columbus, Ohio and went to public schools there. I
                    graduated from high school in 1943, went to Miami (Ohio) University for a half a
                    year and then into the Army for a couple of years, then back to Miami University
                    from which I graduated in 1948. Then I went on to the School of Advanced
                    International Studies (SAIS) of John Hopkins University, graduating in 1950. I
                    entered the Foreign Service in 1951 after passing the entrance examination and
                    stayed in the Foreign Service for 30 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What interested you first in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: My first interest really was my desire to do graduate work. I was a
                    history major at Miami. Professor Howard White of the Political Science
                    Department suggested graduate work in foreign affairs and specifically at SAIS,
                    which had only at that time been in existence for three years. So I went to SAIS
                    in the Spring of 1948 for an interview, was accepted and had no regrets since
                    then. I suppose the interest in foreign affairs really came in my senior year at
                    Miami University. It was a time of considerable activity in Europe—the Marshall
                    Plan was just starting, Marshall had made his famous speech at Harvard in 1947.
                    So foreign affairs seemed to be the most conspicuous activity on the horizon
                    during my senior year. I considered law school—as a matter of fact, I was
                    accepted by Cornell. But foreign affairs got the nod.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You entered the Foreign Service in 1951. What were your
                        entering class like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BREWIN: I came with a group of about twenty-one. It was a fairly representative
                    group. There was not a preponderance of “Ivy League” alumni. They came from
                    every major region of the United States; many had graduate degrees as I did;
                    there was one lawyer in the group; there were two who entered through the
                    examination route, but had already been in the State Department in a junior
                    capacity in Intelligence and Research. I would describe them as a basically
                    representative group for the times, although they were all males. One woman
                    joined the class later. All were white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have adequate training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: The language training was very inadequate. The basic officer course was
                    twelve weeks, at the end of which you got one or two weeks of training in the
                    language of the country to which one had been assigned. I was destined for
                    Zurich. The only German language training I was given was a couple of weeks to
                    build upon the semester of German I had had eight years earlier. It was almost
                    nothing. So I left for Zurich in April 1951 without any command of the
                    language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities in Zurich while you were
                        there from 1951-1853.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: I began in the Consular Section issuing immigration visas and then spent
                    six months in “notarials and invoices”, then a year in passport work. But that
                    time, two and half years had passed and I was transferred directly to
                    Bombay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Switzerland at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Not many. Bern, the capital where the legation was, was a very quiet
                    place and I suspect it still is. It had a one officer Political Section; the
                    Economic Section had some responsibilities on East-West trade—transhipment of
                    sensitive commodities to the Soviet block. Switzerland was involved in that
                    trade. Beyond that, it was just traditional diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were in Bombay from 1953 to 1956. That must have
                        been quite a jump from Zurich. How did you find matters in Bombay?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BREWIN: The post had been just been devastated by a 1953 reduction-in-force (RIF)
                    which abolished three or four officer positions. Bombay, like the other two
                    Consulates General in India, was a fairly large post even after the RIF. It had
                    its own traditional political reporting, not too closely superintendent by the
                    Embassy; it had a Consular Section; two or three economic officers. This was a
                    point in India's history when the issue of linguistic states were erupting and
                    when the state of Bombay in the political sense was very much in doubt. It was
                    uncertain of what state Bombay would be the capital. There were fairly extensive
                    riots, quite extensive and violent. People were killed solely because of the
                    language they spoke. Finally, in Bombay State there was a Chief Minister,
                    Morarji Desai, who a couple of decades later—although unforeseen in the
                    1950s—was to become Prime Minister. He ran the State with an iron fist, had
                    varying interests, including foreign affairs strangely enough. Bombay was an
                    interesting place. During the two and half years I was there I started in
                    consular work and ended in the Economic Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our economic interests in Bombay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: A major function of the Section was its liaison with the large American
                    community. It was not as large as the British community, but it was large
                    enough. There were two large American oil companies, which have since then been
                    nationalized. The secondary function was economic reporting. We had four very
                    good Indian employees who did the bulk of the economic and commercial reporting.
                    They had been at the post for a number of years. India at the time was poised to
                    decide the future course of economic development—a route of substantial laissez
                    faire in the private sector or a route involving substantial central economic
                    planning with allocation of resources by the center. This debate which occurred
                    primarily in Delhi nevertheless had its repercussions both in Bombay, Calcutta
                    and Madras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems dealing with the Indian
                        officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BREWIN: Not really. There were one or two celebrated protection cases in which we
                    felt that the government was being too arbitrary and extreme on blameless
                    American citizens. Both cases involved the ugly issue of race and color. There
                    was an American magician who had a show in Bombay. I had seen it a night or two
                    before the incident. I had been called to the stage and asked to cooperate with
                    the magician in the deception. I did what he said. It was perfectly plain to me
                    that the lady was not being sawed in half. Two days later, one of the Indian in
                    the audience was called up by the magician. He refused to cooperate in the
                    deception. He insisted that he and the audience were being deceived. A shouting
                    match occurred between the Indian and the American entertainer. The magician was
                    upset that the Indian was ruining his act. In the end, assault charges were
                    filed by the Indian. The Consulate's position was as long as the case was being
                    pursued in the Indian courts, the American should have his day. We didn't think
                    that there were any foundation for the assault charges and thought that the
                    whole thing should be forgotten. The Chief Minister told the Consul General that
                    he didn't care whether the case would come before the Indian courts or not. He
                    thought that the days when the white man could push the Indian were long gone.
                    He was going to order the magician deported from India forthwith. That would be
                    the end of the case, regardless what the courts might say in the future. The
                    C.G., William Turner, felt compelled to write up the whole thing as a biographic
                    sketch on Chief Minister Desai and observed at the end of his piece that if
                    Desai were ever to go to Delhi as a minister or Prime Minister, the United
                    States might well have some problem with him. He did become Prime Minister years
                    later and we had fewer problems with Desai then we had with Indira Gandhi or
                    Nehru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling about the relationship between
                        this rather large Consulate General and our Embassy inNew Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Basically, I think they were good. Turner and his predecessors felt that
                    they had as much latitude as they needed to call things as they saw them in
                    Bombay, both in economic and political terms. There were some tasks that
                    naturally the Embassy had to pursue for us—e.g. the expulsion of General Motors.
                    This was a matter on which the Embassy could speak for the United States in the
                    halls of the Indian Ministry of Commerce. But in general, we had enough room to
                    call the situations as we saw them. We were certainly not interfered with in the
                    pursuit of trade promotion opportunities or in political developments in the
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any effects of the McCarthy period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BREWIN: Not particularly in Zurich. There were two or three passport
                    cases—American citizens whom the Department had deemed should not be living
                    abroad because of their political opinions. One of these was a China scholar and
                    although the post was never explicitly told why he should return—we had to amend
                    his passport to limit its use only to return to the US—it was presumed that he
                    had friendly view of the Chinese communists. He objected and stayed in India not
                    withstanding the limitation. Another passport case concerned a naturalized
                    American of German origin. It was quite clear from the messages we received that
                    he was a suspected member of subversive organizations and having engaged in
                    subversive activities. The third case was about a woman who although not
                    politically tainted as a Court might see it, had been subject of a number of
                    messages from security officers in the Embassy concerning her conduct especially
                    vis-a-vis Indian males. she was given a passport valid only for return to the
                    United States. She pursued her case to the Supreme Court and won. This was a
                    period in which the Department lost a whole series of cases in the area of
                    passport issuance discretionary authority. We had a couple of days in the Times
                    of India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that India, being somewhat neutral, left of
                        center period at that time, was a natural attraction which meant that you
                        probably had more of these kinds of cases.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: That may well be. In the case of the naturalized American citizen of
                    German origin who was a scientist and was employed by the Indian Atomic Energy
                    Commission, became so angry that he stomped into my office one day to renounce
                    his American citizenship and did. It was an unfortunate case because I can't
                    imagine in retrospect that he could have been a real threat in any sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You returned to Washington in 1956 and were assigned to
                        the Department of Commerce. What were your impressions of that Department in
                        the mid-50s? There have always been some tension between State and
                        Commerce.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BREWIN: My own experience was positive. The head of the Far East Division to
                    which I was assigned was Gene Braderman who later entered the Foreign Service
                    and went on to be Consul General in Rotterdam. Gene had a fondness for bringing
                    in Foreign Service officers on rotation into his division. There were two
                    divisions which had FSOs assigned when I was there: the Latin America Division
                    and the Far East one. Gene was a very able division director whom I met for the
                    first time at an Economic Commission for Asia and Far East (ECAFE) conference in
                    Bangalore while I was assigned to Bombay. Gene was on the US delegation. He
                    asked me at the time whether I would be interested in a tour in Commerce. I
                    replied affirmatively. So he put in a bid for my services and I was thereafter
                    assigned to Commerce. Vis-a-vis State, we had good relationships with the Office
                    of South Asian Affairs—we attended their weekly staff meetings, knew all the
                    officers in the Office. There was a certain mutuality of interests in the sense
                    of promoting the idea of American investment in India; in viewing India as a
                    counter-weight to China and as a model of democratic development,
                    notwithstanding the problems we had with the Indians on the issue of too much
                    state intervention in the economy to the detriment of American business
                    interests as we saw it. So between State and Commerce, there was a happy
                    coincidence of interests on the economic front. Q: Then you were assigned to INR
                    from 1959 to 1960. What were your main concerns?</p>
                <p>BREWIN: My only concern was to write one chapter of the National Intelligence
                    Survey (NIS), now defunct, on the manufacturing industry. The position I was in
                    was funded by CIA, which no doubt caused me to be put into that famous directory
                    of American intelligence officers published by the East Germans. So that was my
                    main assignment in INR. I did some spot reports from time to time. But mainly it
                    was the chapter on India, worked with the editors to shape it. I stayed about a
                    year and four months, which was quite enough.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: It was excellent. It was a very interesting time. The economic faculty at
                    Stanford had two Marxist economists on the faculty, perhaps two of a bare
                    handful in the whole of the country at that time. I took courses from both of
                    them. The campus was excited by Kennedy's election. The Cuban issue was active.
                    The Bay of Pigs convulsed the campus. It was a very interesting nine months.</p>

                        1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Bolivia was then and may still be somewhat of a “basket” case in terms of
                    economic and social development. The tin mines, its basic industry, were
                    extremely high cost producers unlike Malaysia and other places. It was
                    literately true that they lost money on every pound of tin they produced. They
                    earned dollars, but lost in the profit and loss sense. The State owned mines
                    were a heavily deficit enterprise. The central government's deficit was
                    enormous; they had no way of getting a handle on the situation. Most agriculture
                    was at the subsistence level. I recall that Tony Solomon, later Assistant
                    Secretary for Economic Affairs in State and later Deputy Secretary of Treasury
                    came down on a special mission, after I had arrived. Solomon was very bright and
                    very perspicacious observer. He said that the economy was not viable. He thought
                    that the large sums of money we were putting into Bolivia under the “Alliance
                    for Progress” program were doing little good. President Kennedy had called it
                    the “star in the Alliance's crown”. Solomon saw that the program had to be
                    redirected. State-owned enterprises without exception were losing money hand
                    over fist. Agrarian reform had not accomplished much of anything in economic
                    terms. The State-owned oil enterprise was inefficient and over-staffed. All of
                    these reasons prevented the assistance program from succeeding. A few years
                    after that, Bolivia had the good fortunate to discover oil in the eastern part
                    of the country—Gulf oil uncovered the deposits. Then things looked up for a
                    while. This was after I left the first time.</p>
                <p>It was a good assignment for a junior officer. La Paz was a fun place to be;
                    there were interesting assignments in the economic section in terms of
                    assistance to American business. We had an expropriation case involving American
                    citizens. We kept busy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does the American Embassy do in an expropriation

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BREWIN: What happened was that an American citizen had a very large spread in
                    Santa Cruz, which abutted on the Okinawan and the Japanese colonies which had
                    been brought to Bolivia in the 1940s. Months after we first talked to him about
                    the fact that Okinawans were squatting on his turf, I discovered in the Ministry
                    of Campesino Affairs that indeed a certain portion of his property had been
                    expropriated. The head of the Okinawan colony had gone in and denounced the
                    property owned by this American as being in excess of what was allowed under
                    1952 Agrarian Reform Act, passed after the Revolution of that year. So legally,
                    the Okinawans had a case. There then followed months and literally years of
                    trying to gain some sort of settlement of this case. It was not certain whether
                    the American really wanted his land back. He never could precisely come up with
                    a figure of what he thought it was worth. For the record, the Bolivians said
                    that he as entitled to compensation, but that they didn't have the money and
                    didn't know how much it was worth and they had to have time to think about it.
                    So when I left, the case was unsolved; when I returned as DCM ten years later;
                    it was still unsolved. The American involved was not particularly pressing his
                    case. I don't think he was given other acreage by the Bolivian government in
                    compensation for what was taken from him. For the Okinawans, that was just a
                    suggestion made at one point by the government. As far as I know, it was never
                    settled.</p>

                <p>BREWIN: It is not well known that perhaps our first hostage event in the Foreign
                    Service occurred in Bolivia during my last month there—December, 1963. Doug
                    Henderson had been at post one month as Ambassador, when we had a hostage crisis
                    for about ten days. What had happened was that a delegation of American
                    officials—I could have been one of them, except that I couldn't go at that
                    particular time—,consisting of a Peace Corps volunteer, a USIA information
                    officer, an AID officer went to the major Indian Bolivian mine—”The 20th
                    Century”, or siglo XX—to make a presentation of some school materials to a
                    group. In the course of their one day there, early in the day, they were seized
                    by left-wing Bolivian tin miners and held captive. There were no concrete
                    demands put forth by the miners; it was just an act of opposition to “North
                    American Imperialism”—things they thought we were doing against the interests of
                    the miners. It was a rather dangerous situation. The three of them plus a Dutch
                    citizen who was the manager of one of the government-owned tin mines were held
                    in a house which sat on a huge cache of dynamite which could have gone off at
                    any time had the miners so wished. The miners who took the officials behaved in
                    not too bad a fashion, given the circumstances. The hostages were not physically
                    abused. The house-wives, “amas de casa”, were much more virulent and frequently
                    called for their death. In the end, after protracted negotiations with the
                    miners and the government—President Johnson who had been in office only one
                    month himself became directly involved—, Ambassador Henderson went to the site
                    and took charge of the negotiations. Henderson had been personally involved in
                    the proceedings. Johnson had made eminently clear to the Ambassador that we were
                    holding the Bolivian government fully responsible for this hostage situation.
                    Furthermore, he said that he did not expect that the Americans would be harmed
                    in any way. How they were to be gotten out was a Bolivian government problem. Of
                    course, we were suggesting all kinds of avenues for the Bolivian government to
                    follow to get our people loose from the miners. In the end, the miners
                    union—associated with the left wing of the MNR Party—led by a man by the name of
                    Juan Lechin, was able to prevail on the hostage takers to let the Americans go
                    and then they were freed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: To a mild degree. Bolivia can be a violent place. Elements of the
                    population became armed as result of the 1952 revolution. There were lots of
                    guns around; there were many people who were unhappy with the government for one
                    reason or another, but I can't say that any real threshold was crossed in terms
                    of fears. There may have been an occasional sense of uneasiness, but nothing
                    remotely approaching Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To return to the mission that looked at the Alliance for
                        Progress and said it was all wrong, what was happening in Bolivia at the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BREWIN: The Kennedy administration and particularly Theodore Moscoso, the first
                    chief of the Alliance for Progress, were seeking self-sustaining economic growth
                    which meant profitability for the tin mines—not a viable idea, as we came to
                    realize—, some economic growth in the Eastern province to a point at which our
                    budgetary support—the dole—to Bolivia which went on from 1953, the year after
                    the revolution, could be reduced and genuine investment in the infrastructure
                    could be initiated. That was basically was what it was all about for the two
                    years I was there. We never really succeeded in dealing with the problem because
                    there were some very intractable political problems that the central government
                    faced. One was the tin miners, who opposed violently any reduction in their
                    numbers; another was the centralized bureaucracy which objected to a reduction
                    in government employment; the third was the state enterprises which were all
                    intractable in terms of responding to what was sound managerial advice. It was a
                    difficult proposition for both the Ambassador and the AID mission director and
                    many others who were involved with the Alliance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ben Stephansky was the Ambassador. How did he
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Ben Stephansky operated pretty much on his own. I mean that he was a
                    champion of the Alliance in Bolivia, was inclined to see less fault with the
                    Bolivian government than many of his staff, was of a liberal Democratic
                    persuasion—had been formerly the labor attach� in Mexico and elsewhere—, and he
                    was sent by the Administration to “make the dream come true”. There was a
                    feeling that Bolivia should be the “shining jewel” in the crown of the Alliance
                    for Progress. He was not much taken with internal criticism of the government
                    unless he himself pointed the finger in that direction. I am not suggesting for
                    a moment that Ben was thoroughly naive about the faults of the government or
                    that he did not realize that there were elements within the government who were
                    certainly inimical to our interests nor did not understand that the government's
                    own internal political control apparatus was quite capable of committing human
                    rights violations. It is nevertheless fair to say he perhaps was not as
                    realistic about the regime at various times as was his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that there were constraints on the
                        economic section's reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: There may have been a disposition to emphasize what little there was that
                    was constructive—what seemed to represent progress—and perhaps avoiding
                    over-kill on the negative side. Stephansky felt that Washington already knew how
                    bad things were in Bolivia and didn't want to sink the Alliance until the
                    government had had a fair chance. The Alliance was only two years old when I
                    arrived in La Paz and we all understood that years and years would be required
                    before the economy could be turned around. Constraints perhaps, not so much at
                    my level, but for the AID senior people, who may have felt them more directly
                    than the Economic Section of the Embassy because they were handling the money
                    after all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Our main interests were political. The major one was that the center and
                    center-left elements of the ruling MNR party continue in power and that the left
                    wing of the party be kept out of power by all means, fair or foul. Furthermore,
                    it was our view that Victor Paz, who was the Chief of State then and is the
                    President of Bolivia now, represented real hope. The Administration recognized
                    that; Paz was the last Chief of State to visit Kennedy before the latter's
                    assassination. So we put a lot of faith in Paz. Secondly, our interests were in
                    economic development and specifically that the nationalized tin mines be turned
                    around in some fashion and that this dreadful losing proposition must somehow be
                    made viable. There were all sorts of arguments on how this could be
                    accomplished; for example a massive lay-off of the miners—that was deemed
                    impossible because of the danger of large scale violence and because it might
                    give the left wing the opportunity to take over the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very interesting because some of our academics,
                        particularly earlier in our history in Latin America, thought that our only
                        interest were essentially to further US economic advantages through the
                        development of extractive economic policies—taking things out. In Bolivia's
                        case, apparently there wasn't that much to take out and we were just trying
                        to keep it afloat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: That is right. There were some opportunities in the extracting
                    industries. There were some American companies operating lead, zinc and antimony
                    mines. They became more involved during the military government which ruled
                    during my second tour in Bolivia than they were in the early 1960s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't feel that these were driving influences as
                        far as US policies were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BREWIN: No. There was one private interest which was not American. It was
                    British. These were the Bolivian railroads which were substantially owned by
                    British interests. We were involved in subsidizing the railroads. Like
                    everything else at the governmental level, there were conflicts between the
                    owners and ourselves—principally Ambassador Stephansky— about what should be
                    done about the railroads. The British owners felt that a very hard line was
                    required in respect to the railroad union and government interference in the
                    management of the railroads, with respect to modernization and several other
                    matters. Stephansky was taking the view that the British should not be too hard
                    on the Bolivian government just then. He pointed out that the government had all
                    these other problems and hoped that the issues could be resolved. Basically, the
                    British owners felt that the railroads ought not to get vast amounts of American
                    cash to rehabilitate what was essentially a losing enterprise. They felt that
                    the Bolivian government and the left wing unions were essentially to blame for
                    the situation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Certainly. In the Embassy, under Stephansky's view point and hopes and
                    aspirations for the country, many of us came to have a hopeful, quasi-benign
                    attitude toward Bolivia. When I came back to Washington, both on the State and
                    AID side of the combined ARA-LA Bureau, it struck me that people, particularly
                    at high levels, thought that Bolivia was a hopeless case about which nothing
                    could be done. I was quite struck with this negative and deep-seated Washington
                    attitude. It was not always reflected in the Washington cables to the field. I
                    was responsible for the back-stopping of the Ambassador in his various disputes
                    particularly about levels of economic assistance. I was back on the desk for
                    only a few months when a military coup essentially, led by the vice-president,
                    took place in Bolivia. Paz was over-thrown; he had to stay out of the country
                    for seven years before he could return. This was a terrible shock to the
                    Embassy, particularly to Doug Henderson who had become quite close to Paz and
                    had hopes of turning him around eventually. Suddenly, a coup came along which
                    caught everybody by surprise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the beginning of a revolving kind of government?
                        It seemed that they had a coup every other year.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BREWIN: I don't think so. That happened later. Ren� Barrientos, the
                    Vice-president while I was there, an Air Force General, was a very charismatic
                    figure which Paz was not. If he ever had charisma, he lost it. Barrientos was a
                    very colorful person; he could speak one of the two main Indian languages. He
                    had a touch with the Campesinos that no one else ever had. After the initial
                    shock of the over-throw of Paz wore off, who in the year before had been
                    welcomed at the White House, the Presidential duties were assumed by a general.
                    Barrientos was killed three years later in a helicopter accident. Then the
                    revolving door practice started with a series of military governments followed
                    by an election, followed by a coup and so on. Had Barrientos lived, I don't
                    think the political instability which characterized the early '70s in Bolivia
                    would have ensued or occurred in the same depth that we witnessed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we had a completely unexpected coup in November 1964.
                        How did we respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: We responded by recognizing that Paz was finished. He had taken refuge in
                    Lima and he would stay there for seven years. This was a brief period in which
                    we were making a conscious effort to resume relations, under certain
                    circumstances. We examined the government that was being formed, looking
                    particularly for communist sympathizers. We looked at Barrientos in terms of his
                    capacity to keep the predecessor government's commitments. After about a period
                    of seven or eight days, we declared ourselves prepared to continue relations
                    with Bolivia, which is the terminology we used at that time when confronted with
                    coup situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there thought about not recognizing the new regime at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: No, there wasn't. There was some thought by Tom Mann, the then Assistant
                    Secretary for Latin American Affairs and coordinator for the Alliance for
                    Progress and Special Assistant to the President—he had three titles—to let the
                    non-recognition situation continue until we found more about one or two people
                    in the government. They were thought to have communist antecedents. Indeed, one
                    of them became a considerable thorn in our side years later. Barrientos was
                    chummy with him; they had a personal friendship; he said we were mistaken about
                    his friend's communist origins and he was completely trustworthy. So we finally
                    got over that hurdle and recognized the Barrientos government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: No, I think that was the major development. We then began constructing a
                    relationship with Barrientos of the kind we thought we had with Paz.</p>

                <p>BREWIN: No, I didn't. That came later at mid-term during Nixon's first term.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Personnel from 1966 to 1968. ARA had the
                        reputation of being in-bred. Did you have that feeling? Did you have any
                        problems getting people into the region and out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: There was that feeling. I perceived it to a degree while I was in
                    Personnel. It seemed to me that some officers stayed too long for their own good
                    and that of the Service. There were others who were not in the region who should
                    have been brought in even if that required the sixteen weeks of Spanish or
                    Portuguese language training. We were fortuitous from time to time in getting
                    some very capable officers who wanted to leave the European circuit or the East
                    Asia circuit. The assistance programs that were carrying out in Latin American
                    were attractive to many who wanted to serve in an under-developed country and
                    get a little change of scenery. Dean Hinton, for example, came into ARA for that
                    reason.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: I was in the War College from 1968 to 1969. The Paraguay job was to be
                    vacated in the summer of 1969. I was very interested in becoming a DCM, so I had
                    my name put forward. I had done well in the Personnel job. The then Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Administration, Findley Burns, who was to succeed Rodger
                    Abraham, had a good opinion of me. So when I expressed my interest, he said it
                    was fine with him. He knew the Ambassador, who was also going to be new. So
                    Burns talked to him and got his approval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Paraguay between 1969 and
                        1972?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BREWIN: It was the same situation that had been in existence for many years and
                    was to continue until last year when Stroessner finally left. Stroessner had
                    come to power in 1954. He controlled the country. It was said that a sparrow
                    could not drop from a tree without Stroessner knowing about it, which was
                    probably not much of an exaggeration. We had an AID program, which was not that
                    small despite the size of the country. There were about nine officers in the US
                    military group basically providing training, but there was also some military
                    equipment assistance. So all elements of a country team were present even though
                    on a small scale. As far as any of us could see, Stroessner was the power in the
                    government and that that would continue for the foreseeable future, although
                    there was wide-spread electoral abuse in terms of ballot counting. No one
                    believed that Stroessner could lose even an honest election. There were some
                    storm signals, however, quite evident. The Catholic Church had had a conference
                    in Medellin, Columbia earlier in 1969 during which some strong statements were
                    made about the need for the Church to become closer to the people, to become
                    more vocal for the need for greater social justice and greater compassion for
                    the under-privileged. The documents issued during this conference were taken
                    very seriously by several bishops in power, one of whom was an American. It is
                    fair to say that from 1968-69, a division opened up between the Church and
                    Stroessner in what was otherwise a happy relationship. The events in the '70s
                    and early '80s culminated in Stroessner's over-throw could be perhaps traced to
                    the period we are discussing. In fact, General Rodriguez, who over-threw
                    Stroessner and kicked him out of the country, had been implicated in a coup not
                    long before I got there in 1969. Stroessner, rather than treating Rodriguez
                    roughly, just remonstrated with him, exiled him for a time and told him not to
                    ever do that again. That was obviously a mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Paraguay in the early
                        '70s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: One interest which came to the fore was the drug interest. We had an
                    interesting case. The Embassy became for all purposes a “one issue” Embassy. We
                    tried to get our hands on one man—August Ricord, a Frenchman—whom we thought
                    initially was being protected by the government. This became a real problem for
                    the Ambassador in terms of his relations with Washington and for the Ambassador
                    in terms of his relations with his staff. It was a difficult time. We got our
                    man after sixteen months of badgering the Paraguayans. He was given a thirty
                    year sentence by a court in Miami, of which he served about seven and then
                    returned to Paraguay. It was a difficult period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador during this period was J. Raymond Ylitalo.
                        What were his problems with Washington and his staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BREWIN: The problem with Washington was trying to convince it that he was being
                    as vigorous as it thought he should be in getting the suspect turned over to the
                    United States. Washington's view was that Stroessner ran the country and
                    therefore he could give us the man we wanted. The issues of due process and the
                    Paraguayan courts and the extradition process that the Paraguayans kept raising
                    were not credible, in Washington's eyes. Eventually Washington had to acquiesce
                    and had to let the Paraguayan court system do its will. But Washington frankly
                    felt that Ylitalo was not being zealous enough in pursuing this interest.
                    Washington was absolutely stunned as we were at the post when the court found in
                    the first instance in favor of Ricord. It found that the extradition treaty
                    between The United States and Paraguay didn't apply to drug offenses. This was
                    impossible for Washington to believe that such a decision could have been made
                    without it first being cleared with Stroessner. We finally got over that hurdle
                    and eventually we got our man, but not before we had to break some crockery.</p>
                <p>As for staff, there were many who didn't think that the Ambassador was aggressive
                    enough initially. There was a time in the first few days when the interests of
                    US law enforcement first became known to us when two people came to Asuncion.
                    They didn't want to use the extradition process because it would have been too
                    time consuming. They had their plane and just wanted to take him out of the
                    country. At that point, people thought that we should be able to lay hands on
                    the man. My view, which was opposite of the Ambassador's, was that it had to be
                    made apparent early on in the process that this was just not any extradition
                    case; that there was a political dimension to it; that it was a political issue
                    between the two governments; and that the people around Stroessner—there were
                    certain pipelines to him used for differing purposes—must be given the message
                    that we were serious about this issue. Eventually, that view prevailed because a
                    higher court decided that the suspect was extraditable. Most of us believed that
                    a purely traditional decision—in the sense that we would understand that the
                    judicial operated independently from the executive in Paraguay—was a laughable
                    notion. Most of us believed that only a political dimension would succeed in
                    convincing the Paraguayans to surrender the suspect. I am not so sure that the
                    Ambassador seized that understanding in quite the way he should have in the
                    first few months of the case. To the Paraguayans credit, though, they did jail
                    Ricord, without bond, and kept him until the case was finally resolved in the
                    courts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the CIA operate in this situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: The station in Asuncion was small. It had its own interests and it was
                    perfectly prepared to be helpful as much as it could. But this issue really
                    revolved around the Embassy making its view known to President Stroessner. The
                    station couldn't do much beyond that. So it could not really help or hinder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BREWIN: AID was useful in terms of getting our view of the issue to the various
                    Ministries it dealt with. All the Ministers were of course Stroessner
                    appointees. Some were generals who were friends of Stroessner since their junior
                    officer days. AID was useful in that way. The assistance program was fairly
                    large for a country the size of Paraguay. We had programs in agriculture,
                    education, small manufacturing, but mostly agriculture and education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem justifying an assistance program
                        to a dictator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: That was not a major problem. We realized that there were “red light” and
                    green light” countries on the human rights cum political democracy front. Two
                    favorite countries would have been Columbia and Costa Rica while Cuban would
                    obviously be an unfavored one. We tended to believe that Paraguay was in an
                    “amber caution light” zone. There was just so far that Stroessner could go
                    before jeopardizing assistance levels, particularly military aid. He seemed to
                    sense that as well to a degree. We talked frequently to the political opposition
                    and didn't hide that fact; we talked to some dissident Church people from time
                    to time as needed and the government knew that was happening and didn't express
                    any particular objection. It was certainly away from the posture that the Reagan
                    administration took in its last years under Assistant Secretary Abrams. I was
                    stunned in respect of how wise and needed was the opening of society to
                    democratic dissent.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Paraguay in 1972 and went to La Paz as Deputy
                        Chief of Mission. Were you beginning to feel a little land-locked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: I was. But I was attracted by the prospect of working for Ambassador
                    Siracusa, then our Ambassador to Bolivia. I had known him, although not well,
                    since the '60s. I had some familiarity with Bolivia, having served there
                    previously. That may have given me a leg up on the job. In going there, I was
                    not surprised to find that not too much had changed after all the years. The
                    same unfinished office buildings were there; the same problems were at hand; it
                    was just as expensive to mine a pound of tin as it had always been. There had
                    been one salutary development, however, which may have kept the country
                    together—to the extent it was kept together at all—, had been the discovery of
                    oil in the Eastern Provinces. That was a substantial development which occurred
                    in Santa Cruz as a consequence of an oil strike. Gulf found the oil; it was
                    nationalized in 1970 by the Bolivians much to everyone's distress.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The years 1972-74 saw the beginning of the drug issue as a major problem for the
                    United States. Unlike the Paraguayan experience, where it took sixteen months to
                    get a well known heroin trafficker before our courts, in Bolivia it was always
                    fairly easy to get the malefactors transferred to our custody in the middle of
                    the night at the airport. They were cooperative in the law-enforcement sense. It
                    became difficult for the Bolivians to respond some time later. When it came to
                    the matter of growing the coca leaf, which was the sole support for many
                    Campesinos, this was much more difficult and we still have that problem today. I
                    don't know where the answer will be found.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked for two Ambassadors: Siracusa and Bill Stedman.
                        What was the difference in their methods of operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Only to the extent that Siracusa had been there for four years when I
                    arrived. It is best to describe his approach as relaxed. The mission was running
                    smoothly by and large. People knew what their jobs were and did them well. I
                    would say that there was no real significant differences between the two men in
                    their styles. Both were quite “hands-on” when the need arose which it did from
                    time to time. I enjoyed working with both; I think I learned something from each
                    of them.</p>

                        the drug business and the finding of oil while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: We were looking to see what would happen after President Banzer. He had
                    been a general who has seized power from Torres who was almost a “nightmare come
                    true”—a crypto-communist chief of state. Banzer's military coup threw out
                    Torres. Banzer was a center-right person who governed in a quasi-martial law
                    environment. He was favorable toward the United States. He had aspirations to
                    become a civilian, elected President; we encouraged him along this path.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when Torres was in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: No. Banzer overthrew Torres in late '71 or early '72. Torres had been a
                    very difficult problem for the Embassy and for Siracusa in particular because
                    Torres seemed to make real the fears we had in the early ''60s about Juan
                    Lechin, the chief of the tin mines, coming to power. That seemed to have
                    happened when Torres came to power. The government had been penetrated at
                    various levels by communists; the Peace Corps was harassed by the government as
                    agents for American imperialism. It was a very difficult period. Banzer was like
                    a breath of fresh air for us. Siracusa and I and others regarded him as the last
                    hope for Bolivia in terms of political stability.</p>

                <p>BREWIN: I was called by Personnel while in Bolivia as my tour was coming to an

                    back the following day. They said ok, but no later than that. I discussed it
                    with my wife who was ecstatic about the idea of going back to the Middle East,
                    where she had served before we were married. So I agreed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: When I got there, the recycling of the petrodollar had begun with a real
                    vengeance. The oil price increases of the early ''70s were just beginning to
                    bring in the bountiful receipts. The country was knee-deep in Western
                    businessmen looking for a piece of the action. It seemed to herald an era of $22
                    billion of expenditures per year, every year as far as one could foresee in the
                    future. There might have been ups and downs in the revenues and problems here
                    and there—including problems of absorbing all the imports—but it seemed like
                    good times would never stop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were encouraging the Iranians to spend considerable

                        How did you and the Embassy feel about this policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: The Embassy's point of view was that what the Shah asked for, he got,
                    with very few exceptions—some very high tech items which in some cases hadn't
                    even been released to US forces. The “Nixon doctrine” governed. We viewed the
                    Shah as the keeper of peace in the Gulf area. He was the bulwark of stability in
                    the area. If he wanted to buy stuff from us, that was fine; we were happy to
                    sell it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was our policy. How was it viewed internally in the
                        Embassy? Was there concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: There were occasional manifestations of concern, but they never really
                    percolated up to the Ambassador or in field reports. The concerns that we
                    received were from the Congress about why a certain weapon system was being sold
                    and why it had to be so sophisticated (e.g. the Airborne Warning System
                    (AWACS)). The role of the Embassy and particularly the Ambassador was to
                    interpret the role of Iran to the Congressmen. He had to point out the Shah's
                    real needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have trouble with Congress? We had a policy which
                        was being challenged outside the Administration. Did for example the
                        economic section question whether Iran should be spending these huge amounts
                        on military hardware when there were developmental needs elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: No; that was never a problem for my section. One of the givens in the
                    economic section that we had to work with was that there would be significant
                    amounts spent for military hardware and whether we rationalized it to ourselves
                    or were looking for a pretext, I don't know, but we said—and DoD said this—there
                    would spin-offs from these weapon purchases in turn of economic development—for
                    example, co-production. We thought that eventually aircraft would be
                    manufactured in Iran. Motor vehicles would be built in Iran in greater numbers.
                    These were all spin-offs from weapon sales. I don't think our policy caused my
                    section any great problems. We were kept busy enough with the purely commercial,
                    non-military business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there concerns about the vast influx of Americans
                        that came along with the weapon sales?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Not really serious ones while I was there. Bell helicopter, primarily
                    based in Isfahan, had a reputation, not really deserved, for having a bunch of
                    rowdies—Americans perfectly capable of driving a motorcycle through a mosque
                    half naked or giving offense to the Iranians in a variety of ways. Most of these
                    stories were apocryphal. Most Americans were put on their good behavior by their
                    employers back in the US and most were aware that Iran was a different place by
                    far from any place they had ever been, including the Arab world. They knew that
                    there were sensitivities. There were exceptions from time to time, but the
                    potential problem which some of us foresaw was the issue of Americans being held
                    hostage in a time when the Shah might become less secure on his throne. What
                    would we do with thirty two thousand Americans if the Shah were to go down the
                    tube?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was concern that the Shah might not be there
                        forever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Yes. The concern was not that one could foresee the Shah's overthrow in a
                    coup d'etat, but when after many years he would pass from the scene by death or
                    some incapacity. Could then the new Shah tame what might be pressures on the
                    society? Then what happens to the Americans if there were riots in the streets
                    or disturbances of the kind that occurred under Mossadegh?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we looked back to the Mossadegh period as a potential
                        model for the future?</hi>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BREWIN: Yes; something to be avoided at all costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the large American civilian presence was a major
                        concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: It was a major concern. I was active in the US-Iran Chamber of Commerce—I
                    was an office-holder for the period I was there—provided monthly forums for the
                    Americans to meet. There were reasonable amounts of social outlets for the
                    Americans—far, far more than there were in Saudi Arabia, for example. There were
                    possibilities of interesting travel within Iran. So I never found the American
                    community to be a difficult one to work with either in the business sense or to
                    live with in the social sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your dealings with the Iranian officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: We came to understand more and more as time went on that, as Ambassador
                    Richard Helms put it in one of his telegrams to Kissinger, Iranians had by now
                    wanted to be treated as equal partners when they sat at the table with us. No
                    more crumbs. This was the prevailing official attitude. The Iranians I dealt
                    with were usually charming and very hospitable. When they said “No”, they often
                    found ways to do so in a charming and friendly manner, but it was quite clear
                    that there was an element of nationalism present in the Iranian make up and in
                    the Shah's government which went from top to bottom. One understood that this
                    was present and could surface, and did, from time to time. For example, we had
                    the US-Iranian Joint Commission—an institution that Kissinger conceived—as a
                    mechanism in the OPEC countries through which the United States could move in
                    basically any technically assistance on a government-to-government level as
                    desired by the host government. There was one in Saudi Arabia and one in Iran
                    and one in India. That never really got going as an idea because the Iranians
                    always seemed to be busy with other things and what was it that this Joint
                    Commission was supposed to accomplish that existing mechanisms could not? It was
                    clear that we saw the Commission as a petro-recycling mechanism—to get the
                    Bureau of Public Roads into Iran, the Census Bureau, the Department of
                    Agriculture. The Iranians said “Fine. We'll be glad to have these people, but we
                    will pick and choose and this Commission is not to be deemed as an United States
                    export promotion device”. That was fair enough.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>These were very interesting times. It was a very, very active post and section.
                    The work-load was absolutely horrendous—day in and day out, people were seeking
                    advice of one kind or another. In the early months, it was hard for me to give
                    advice because of the tight control that the government exercised over
                    information distribution. The two English language dailies in Tehran were almost
                    worthless as a depository of any kind of information of interest to me. So we
                    had to go out and dig for it and often that meant doing it on the social circle
                    at night, which then became essentially an extension of the office in terms of
                    information collection. It was probably eighteen months before I felt
                    sufficiently sure of myself in my grasp of what was happening in the country and
                    what was likely to happen. It was only then that I could counsel those who came
                    in as to what they should or shouldn't do in terms of their business
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you looked at the economy of Iran, did you feel that
                        viable investment were being made by the Shah and his government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: He was not investing enough in agriculture. There were two things for
                    which one could criticize the Iranian government without fear of being looked at
                    askance by your Iranian interlocutors. One was the mayor of Tehran, who was fair
                    game because of the condition of the city—congestion and pollution. The other
                    that Iran had turned from a food-surplus to a food-deficit nation in less than a
                    couple of decades. The Shah seemed not to do a lot about that problem. An awful
                    lot of money went into construction of various kinds—office buildings, homes,
                    cultural centers, monuments of one kind or another. All of these gobbled up a
                    great deal of money. Some of it was purely wasted. A great deal of money was
                    spent on the beginning of a petro-chemical complex on the Persian Gulf and three
                    or four nuclear power plants in 1978 and early '79.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any constraints in your reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Not in my section. I think the political section was constrained; there
                    is no question about that. They were constrained about reporting on human rights
                    violations, on the opposition to the Shah. I think that constraint was present
                    going back even to 1953 when we put the Shah back on his throne. Some
                    Ambassadors were far more vehement on this subject than others—Douglas MacArthur
                    II, for example, would tolerate no criticism of the Shah in the post's reporting
                    whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served under two hard-charging Ambassadors: Richard
                        Helms, ex CIA chief, and William Sullivan, who had been sort of a “field
                        marshal” in Vietnam. How would you compare them in style and methods?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BREWIN: I am genuinely fond of both Helms and Sullivan. Helms could be a bit
                    remote at times but at the same time was an “open door” Ambassador—you could
                    walk right in and discuss any problems you might have. You didn't have to go
                    through the D.C.M. if you didn't want to. We had daily staff
                    meetings—Ambassador, DCM, station chiefs and the counselors. They only lasted
                    15-20 minutes which was sufficient to apprise people of what was going on.</p>
                <p>Both Helms and Sullivan had good relations with the Shah. Neither one was
                    disposed to speak outside the confines of the front office what the Shah may
                    have said to him unless it bore directly on the work of the section chief. I
                    therefore remember seeing only one or two cable reports of Ambassador-Shah
                    meetings during the time I was there. This was done essentially to make sure
                    that these conversations did not get on the street or the cocktail circuit. That
                    was understandable. It is hard to contrast them. Sullivan perhaps came to take,
                    while I was there, a more direct “hands-on” role with the Political Section
                    reporting because by that time, early 1978 on, it was clear that something was
                    happening in terms of opposition to the Shah. Helms was very interested and
                    active in meeting Iranians. He resisted the idea that he should only have the
                    usual Iranian contacts that the Embassy and previous Ambassadors had cultivated.
                    He struck out in new directions. Sullivan continued that practice to a
                    degree.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Turmoil was clearly present by that time. People have asked me what the
                    first manifestations were that matters were going awry. My own recollection is
                    it started in Tabriz when the mobs sacked a government bank—Bank Melli, meaning
                    “National” in Farsi— leaving broken glass all over the place. Nothing happened
                    and nothing was done to the rioters. Then it seemed to me that something was
                    going wrong. When this misdeed went unpunished, the Shah lost face and command
                    and control. Then he became vulnerable to other acts against the State. These
                    episodes continued throughout 1978 and we now know what happened in the end.
                    However, when I left, the Shah was still in power and I thought that he would
                    continue, but I had no sense how he was going to deal with the situation. It
                    occurred to me that “in extremis”, the military might well clamp down forcefully
                    and that the Shah would be able to survive the situation.</p>

                <p>BREWIN: We looked after our interests in international organizations dealing with
                    food matters. All these organizations were based in Rome. We had a separate
                    mission there called FODAG, which is now headed by an official of Ambassadorial
                    rank—that wasn't true then. A small staff of Foreign Service and AID officers
                    which represented our interests in FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), Food
                    for Peace, IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) and an
                    umbrella policy body—the World Food Council which met one a year. We made up the
                    delegations for the FAO meetings, coordinated with the Department of
                    Agriculture, dealt with contentious issues in the FAO of which there were a few.
                    It was not the best of times nor the worst of times for US relations with these
                    bodies. It got much worst later particularly in terms of budgets. The then and
                    now Director General of FAO was not the easiest person to deal with; he tended
                    to run the organization as a private fiefdom, which annoyed us. He could be
                    unresponsive occasionally on political issues. The budget was always a problem
                    for us; it seemed to be always too large. Some of the activities undertaken by
                    the Director General seemed to be outright political for the benefit of the
                    Third World, which is where the votes were for his re-election every four years.
                    Edward Saouma is an able water resources technician and able in other ways as
                    well. I suppose he is head of the FAO for as long as he wants to stay. He can be
                    prickly when he wants to be.</p>

                <p>BREWIN: The Asylum Office in the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs
                    deals with two elements of the Department of Justice: the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service (INS) and the various immigration judges. We supply,
                    pursuant to an Executive order which was issued in about 1972, advisory opinions
                    on applications for political asylum made by foreigners living in the United
                    States. That is our role by Executive Order. The role of the Department of
                    Justice, by statute, is to decide in each asylum case whether or not, using our
                    advisory opinions as guidance or not as they see fit—our opinion is non
                    binding—the person has a well founded fear of persecution in his home land for
                    any of five reasons: race, nationality, membership in social group, religion or
                    political opinion. If pursuant to the guidelines laid down by the courts, by
                    various U.N. bodies, various internal federal government guidelines, a person
                    can establish a well-founded fear of persecution to the satisfaction of the INS
                    examiner or the immigration judge, if the case goes that far, the person can be
                    granted asylum, which mean status tantamount to permanent residence in the
                    United States. He then has the right to work legally. A person from a country in
                    the Near East says he can't return to Syria, for example for reasons given in
                    the application, it is my job to examine that, evaluate it and then tell the INS
                    office to which he has applied, my views on his or her assertion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one example that immediately springs to mind as a
                        political potato is Israel with its power over the West Bank with its
                        preponderance of Palestinians. Would a Palestinian be eligible, even given
                        Israel's strong ties with the United States and given its domestic
                        constituency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: Thus far we have seen comparatively few Palestinians who have fled either
                    the West Bank or Gaza since the Intifada—the uprising—broke out in December
                    1987. What we do see are Palestinians who lived in Lebanon, around the Arabian
                    Peninsula, worked in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates for a number
                    of years—taken in some instances there by their parents—who have gotten a
                    visitor's visa to the United States and then apply for asylum when their
                    resident permit in the United Arab Emirates, for example, has expired. He has no
                    where else to go; he is stateless. There are allegations about persecution by
                    Israel which go way back in time, back to 1947-48 when their parents left
                    Palestine. The circumstances vary from case to case. We have seen only a few
                    cases thus far alleging persecution in the West Bank and Gaza following the
                    outbreak of the intifada. I think we will. I don't think that there is any
                    particular reason for it; it may be that there are difficulties in getting visas
                    in the first place. A number have entered illegally of course. Many undoubtedly
                    are just staying there just to see what happens.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Lebanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BREWIN: There is chaos in Lebanon and virtually every Lebanese who gets to the
                    United States—regardless of how—applies for asylum. Generally they do not get it
                    at least in the numbers that one might expect. The reason is for this is that
                    civil war alone does not normally get you asylum from the INS. Generally you
                    have to show that you have been targeted or singled out—I don't like to use
                    those terms because they have certain legal implications with which people are
                    uncomfortable—or that they have been mistreated in more than one area of the
                    country. I think the grant of asylum to Lebanese, according to the INS, is
                    perhaps 15-20% which is a respectable number considering the constraints on INS
                    because of the civil war issue.</p>
