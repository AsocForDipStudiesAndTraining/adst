                <p>FREDERICK (TED) G. MASON, JR.</p>
                <p>Interview by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 2, 2000</p>

                <p>Q: Today is second of March 2000. This is an interview with Frederick G. Mason,
                    Jr. known as Ted. This is being done on behalf of the Diplomatic Studies and
                    Training. Can you tell us when and where you were born and something about your
                    family?</p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, I was born in Waterbury, Connecticut on May 25, 1926. Both my parents
                    were born there. My father and his father and his grandfather were involved in
                    the brass business in the area. And you may know, Waterbury in WWII was known as
                    the Brass Center of the World. But after WWII, the brass industry declined, and
                    by the 1950s or 1960s, the old mills had closed, and the buildings torn down. We
                    have shopping malls there now. A hundred thousand people still live there, but I
                    don't know what they live on. Thankfully, I left there myself at the age of 18
                    when I went into the army, though I am involved now in supporting the local
                    Mattatuck Museum and have funded scholarships to nearby Taft School and Yale for
                    students from the general area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let us talk about growing up. In the first place, could
                        you tala little bit about the background of your father, Mason, a
                        Yankee</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: My father was a Yankee, he was a Mayflower descendent. He went to Yale and
                    the Taft school before that in Watertown, Connecticut, where I grew up. He was
                    in the first class of the Taft school in Watertown. He was born in 1879 and
                    entered in 1893 and graduated in 1897.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to play football against them. I went to Kent
                        School.Can you tell us about your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MASON: My Mother's mother was Swiss and her father was Austro-Hungarian. Both
                    were immigrants who came separately to America in 1885 and married in 1898. My
                    mother was born in Waterbury in 1900 and became secretary to the executive
                    director of the local manufacturers association, where she met my father, who
                    was involved with the Chase Brass and Copper Company at that time. They married
                    in 1924 and took a wedding trip to Europe. I was born in 1926 when my father was
                    retired and living well on income from stocks. He bought a house, and took out a
                    mortgage on it. It cost $25,000, which was a lot of money in those days. But
                    with the Crash of 1929 and the Depression my father lost most of his income.
                    Kennicott Copper Company stopped paying dividends. It was a very tough decade
                    for him. He was 47 when I was born and 50 in 1929. So it was very hard for him
                    to find a job at that age. We moved several times. The house became too
                    expensive to heat, and so we found people who would take it for a year or two,
                    permitting us to move to Waterbury, and into houses that were cheaper to run. In
                    the winter of 1937-1938, my parents even moved to Florida to avoid paying
                    heating costs, and so I spent most of my seventh grade, at age eleven, at Fort
                    Myers, where I was known as, “That little Yankee boy.” Then we came back and I
                    finished my grade school education in Watertown.</p>
                <p>I had begun my education at the Watertown Country Day School, which was an
                    expensive experimental school for the elite. This was hard on my parents
                    financially. But the school itself closed in 1937, and I finished seventh and
                    eighth grade at the public school. I greatly appreciated the change and was
                    happy there. But with Taft next door I wanted more than anything else to go to
                    Taft School like my Dad. I was awarded a scholarship, and I went through Taft in
                    four years as a day student.</p>
                <p>Q: You went to Taft from when to when?</p>
                <p>MASON: From 1939 to 1943, Class of 1943. And graduated cum laude and entered Yale
                    on a scholarship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back a little bit. When you were at home what
                        were thfamily interests, you know, books, reading, music?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, books and music. There was a good-size library. My father had the
                    library of men of his class, big sets of Stevenson, the Great Events, and the
                    Bostonian and English authors and so on. So I did a good deal of reading. But I
                    did develop a great interest in foreign affairs, especially European history. I
                    remember in WWII following the invasion of Russia and the retreat of the Germans
                    with a huge wall map with colored pins, marking every move that was made in each
                    direction. I won a contest at Taft given by Time Magazine on current events. As
                    a prize I was given The Secret History of the American Revolution by Carl Van
                    Doren.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Q: I got, I think in 1943, I got Here's Your War by Ernie Pyle. I won mine, too.
                    I have the book around somewhere. I would imagine that WWII, for all of us that
                    paid attention and read, was a tremendous geography lesson.</p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, I learned more names of towns and places</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You learned where Benghazi was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Iwo Jima.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: The South Pacific, I do not know too well. I still can't place all the new
                    countriesQ: Well they change their names...</p>
                <p>MASON: True, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about reading? Can you think of anything you liked to
                        read?Were you not much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: As a kid, I subscribed to “The American Boy” and read Tom Sawyer, Call of
                    the Wild, Terhune, Curwood, etc. But as a teenager, I liked Shakespeare, King
                    Lear, Julius Caesar, and these are mostly if not entirely political. They all
                    have political context and that increased my interest in foreign affairs. I
                    liked drama. I had the Modern Library edition of Nine Plays by Eugene O'Neill, I
                    thought it was great stuff. I was disappointed when my teacher at Taft, who let
                    me report on these plays at first, turned me away, saying, “You have no time for
                    this. You should be studying what we have in class.” I resented this because I
                    was fascinated by what I was reading. Mourning Becomes Elektra, for instance,
                    though I didn't understand it because I hadn't yet read the Oresteia. It was
                    only later that I read the Greek tragedies, which to me are the supreme example
                    of great literature. I wasn't great at sports, I played soccer, but I wasn't a
                    football player or a baseball player (though later, at Yale, I was on the
                    varsity swimming squad under Bob Kiphuth). I was on the debating squad, doing
                    inter-school debating on subjects of foreign and domestic policy. I should say
                    here that I've always had an interest in writing-short stories, novels, plays.
                    I've drawn inspiration from the classics, but until 1999, when one of my novels
                    was finally published- Hostage to Fortune by Ted Mason-I had been writing all my
                    life in my spare time and had sold only one story back in 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the war affect you at all at Taft?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MASON: No, the curriculum and the scheduling were the same. We did a little
                    community work around Waterbury, sweeping sand off the streets after the snows
                    and that sort of thing. I took jobs for a week or two during holidays, once at
                    the Princeton Knitting Mills downtown. I remember at the Waterbury Post Office
                    over the Christmas season I found several masters sitting there working like
                    myself, and I remember being ashamed for them because I thought a master much
                    too august a figure to be sorting mail in a post office. But I got used to it.
                    And one summer I did work at the American Brass Company as a messenger. I don't
                    think I was outstanding in any of these jobs, but I did get a little
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if you graduated in 1943, you must have been prime
                        meat,weren't you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Oh, yes, though I was only seventeen at the end of May 1943 and so had a
                    year in college. I went to Yale on my scholarship on the first of July, in the
                    Class of 1946, assigned to Timothy Dwight College. We were living in a building
                    which has since been torn down-the Colony Club at 17 Hillhouse Avenue. We had an
                    interesting summer there, but then I moved into Timothy Dwight for the fall
                    term. It was a disastrous year for me. I had never failed a course before. You
                    had no choice in your courses. You were assigned one course in each of six
                    general subjects, one being the sciences, and they put me in physics and I
                    failed it. I was absolutely crushed by that. I'd had no counseling and didn't
                    know where to go from there. I never took another course in physics or in any
                    other science. Of course, my hopes for Phi Beta Kappa were dashed.</p>
                <p>Then by the spring of 1944, as I approached my 18th birthday as a sophomore
                    (these were three-term years, with the third term squeezed into a summer
                    session), I was able to finish half of sophomore year before I went into the
                    Army. But I was “gung ho” and didn't want to be thought of as a draftee. I
                    joined the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps, even though it was almost the same
                    thing. It allowed me to finish that term in June before going into the army in
                    July, a month after D-Day, and reporting to Fort Devens, Massachusetts. I had
                    been at Taft since the war in Europe began in 1939 and at the time of Pearl
                    Harbor, and my entire memory of those school years is one of war. Since I was a
                    year young for my class, most of my class mates had already gone into military
                    service. Many had very fine combat records, and several were wounded and more
                    than one killed. I wanted to do my share. In fact, I was so eager to serve that
                    the first time we lined up at Fort Devens and the platoon sergeant asked for
                    volunteers to pull KP (Kitchen Patrol), I actually volunteered! I worked until
                    about four o'clock in the morning. Then after a day or two we boarded a troop
                    train and rode through the Hoosick tunnel to Troy, New York, and then on to
                    Cleveland and points west. Only after we were safely on board did the T-5 who
                    was in charge open our orders and say, “You're going to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, to
                    the Field Artillery Replacement Training Center.”</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I had never been out west before. I had spent two winters in Florida, and I had
                    once been to Bermuda. But there we were, out in Oklahoma, where we even saw a
                    few buffalo on bivouac. They put me in a clerk's battery, but rather than spend
                    the war as a clerk, I applied for OCS. I didn't volunteer for Artillery OCS
                    because I didn't trust my ability in math, so instead I volunteered for Infantry
                    School at Fort Benning, Georgia. I was accepted, as an 18 year-old kid, to
                    become a combat platoon leader if I could get through the 17-week course.</p>
                <p>After a few weeks, the members of each platoon had to rate every other member,
                    and althougI don't know how I was rated, I was surely at the bottom, never
                    having even seen an M-1 rifle. I went up before a Board after the 12th of the 17
                    weeks, and could have been flunked out. But fortunately, the Board liked the way
                    I gave orders and moved imaginary troops around in front of them, and so they
                    started me over again, in the next class being formed. At age 19, I was
                    commissioned a second lieutenant infantry on the 19th of July 1945, three weeks
                    before the bomb was dropped, and since then I have always said the bomb saved my
                    life. And the lives of a million other men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, getting ready to invade Japan with horrendous
                        casualties...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: As a result, I have always felt that that put me under an obligation to
                    try to live a life that would somehow or other justify this tremendous piece of
                    luck. On the other hand, I didn't have my so-called “moment of truth,” which
                    would have made a difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, sometimes these moments of truth end up as the
                        lasmoment of truth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, or I could have ended up like Bob Dole, who was a couple of years
                    ahead of me at the same OCS. He spent I don't know how many years in
                    rehabilitation and he still doesn't have the use of his arm. I do and was very
                    lucky. So, having taken four years of French at Taft School, I had the grammar
                    down pretty well but had no conversational ability, of course, because we didn't
                    do that in those days in language classes. I could pass a test, but I was no
                    great shakes at French. At Yale, I had started with German, hoping it would
                    prove useful. My grandmother was Swiss and spoke Schwietzerdeutsch, which I
                    never learned to understand - except for a few ditties. So, I did have a year
                    and a half of German in addition to French before I went into the army.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Now, with the war over, it was the end of August or the middle of September 1945
                    and I didn't know where we were going. So I went to a major in Personnel whom I
                    had never met before. I think his name was Evans. I remember nothing else about
                    him except that he changed my life. I told him I'd studied German and French,
                    and asked if I could go to Europe instead of Japan in the occupation. Within a
                    week or so I had orders assigning me to the AGRC, the American Graves
                    Registration Command in Europe. It was humiliating for a gung-ho infantry
                    officer who wanted to fight for his country, but it meant I would go to Europe
                    for the first time. They sent me to Fort McClellan outside Anniston, Alabama,
                    for a week, and then to Camp Lee, which later became Fort Lee outside of
                    Petersburg, Virginia. Then in December to Camp Shanks up the Hudson from New
                    York City. From here, I boarded a cruiser, the USS Boise, and crossed the
                    Atlantic in the winter.</p>
                <p>Coming into Le Havre in December 1945, you could still see the funnels of sunken
                    ships above the water line. We landed as young second lieutenants and with tags
                    on our caps and were herded into open trailer trucks with just our heads
                    sticking up. As we were driving up to the casern, where we would spend a few
                    hours, down came another truck with men on their way home, and did we get a
                    horse laugh. I remember having conversations in the casern with German
                    technicians who were being sent to the States. I assumed they must have been
                    working on the bomb or the V1 and V2 rockets in Germany.</p>
                <p>We boarded a train and arrived in Paris the next morning, ready for a few days of
                    work at the Trianon Palace Hotel in Versailles. The Graves Registration Command
                    operated with three field commands, while the headquarters remained in Paris.
                    The commanding general was Major General Littlejohn, who later headed the
                    Veterans Administration. The whole thing was under the Quartermaster Corps and
                    most of the higher-ranking officers were Quartermaster officers. One field
                    command was established in Fulda, West Germany, northeast of Frankfurt. The
                    second one was in Brussels and the third one at Aix-en-Provence, in the south of
                    France. The Brussels Command was to move down the west coast of France and into
                    Spain, in search of isolated graves, while our Third Field Command moved up the
                    Rhone from the Mediterranean, putting out the word in villages and towns that if
                    anyone had an airman buried in his yard - and this happened, too - to please let
                    us know and we would transfer the remains to a cemetery. They sent the bodies
                    either to the States - if the families so requested - or buried them in a
                    cemetery in Europe. But there were to be no cemeteries on German soil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Luxembourg had a very big one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MASON: Luxembourg had one at Hamm, and Henri Chapelle in Belgium. But they were
                    in the Brussels, or Second, Field Command. We, in the Third Field Command,
                    followed the Seventh Army up the Rhone valley. We established our headquarters
                    in Aix-en-Provence, spending Christmas there, but after the first of May we
                    moved up to Strasbourg. We had units in Grenoble, Lyon, and Dijon which moved
                    with us. From Strasbourg we followed the Seventh Army across Southern Germany
                    and into Austria. My jobs were of no great importance. I was mess officer for a
                    time, and served as Defense Counsel on two or three Special Courts Martial. I
                    was only a second lieutenant, after all. But I did see something of France and
                    Europe. I was lucky enough to be sent back to Paris on TDY a couple of times,
                    and I was able to drive a jeep up through the Alps to Grenoble, and from
                    Strasbourg to Reims and back with the unit payroll. From Strasbourg, in the
                    summer of 1946, the Red Cross or the Special Services ran a Swiss-Rome tour. One
                    could take two weeks or 10 days of leave and board a train from Strasbourg to
                    Basle and from there take a Swiss train stopping in Lucerne and overnight in
                    Lugano, continuing on to Rome and spending something like five days at the Hotel
                    Excelsior, then back by the same route. This was a magnificent trip.</p>
                <p>Lugano was lovely, but in Rome we had an audience with Pope Pius XII, which was a
                    very impressive affair. Later, I had to drive to Reims again from Strasbourg
                    with a .45 on my hip and pick up the payroll for all our subordinate units. I
                    even had an opportunity to take a jeep on a five day trip to our unit in Austria
                    with an Alsatian driver who was fluent in French and German and was an ex-member
                    of the Wehrmacht. We slept in Salzburg and drove up to Hitler's villa and
                    Eagle's Nest above Berchtesgaden. The villa was bombed out and was later
                    demolished, but I have a photo of myself framed by the picture window.</p>
                <p>My driver knew a girl in Austria, where he'd been stationed, and we drove to her
                    hometown in K�rnten (Carinthia) on the way back to see her. I don't know if he
                    was able ever to marry her or even to get back there. Our unit was in Kindberg.
                    I've been through there since then several times. It's on the main road through
                    the mountains from Salzburg to Vienna, via Semmering, a Viennese winter resort
                    where you can go from a thousand meters elevation down onto the plain to Vienna.
                    My orders said go to Kindberg, pay the troops and come back. But with Sunday
                    off, I had an extra day, and without orders, I decided to try for Vienna. So I
                    took the jeep and my driver, and at Semmering stopped at the Soviet Zone. Out
                    came a tough-looking Asian trooper. I showed him my orders. He looked at them
                    and gave them back to me and mentioned, “Go ahead.” We did so and saw another of
                    the great cities of Europe, but one which was in worse condition than when Carol
                    Reed made his film.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What movie do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MASON: The Third Man. On the way back it rained hard on the southern highway out
                    of Vienna and we skidded off the road into the ditch, which gave us a real
                    problem. The jeep was on its side, though we weren't hurt, but one wheel was
                    bent out of shape. I flagged down a convoy of Soviet troops, in trucks, who
                    changed the wheel. I have a photo of that, too. We got back to Kindberg safely
                    and the next morning the motor pool officer grudgingly gave me a new wheel in
                    exchange. We drove back over the Brenner and Arlberg Passes to Strasbourg
                    thanking our lucky stars and within a month I had my orders back to the States.
                    I was sent through Frankfurt to Bremerhaven and boarded the Colby Victory, a
                    Victory Ship. The sea was very calm and pleasant coming back into New York
                    harbor. I guess we must have docked on the Jersey side because we were sent
                    directly to Camp Kilmer, where we were demobilized. Of course, we were glad to
                    get out of the army, since “nobody with any brains at all would stay in the
                    army.” We were all cocky and going to do something great individually, and never
                    work for Uncle Sam again.</p>
                <p>So when I signed out, I was of two minds when they asked me if I wanted to stay
                    in the Army Reserve, where I would have two weeks of training in the summer
                    after 24 weekly meetings each year, and if I earned 50 points, one for each
                    meeting and 14 for my two weeks training, I'd have a good year for retirement.
                    So, I agreed. And what a difference that has made in my life! Except for the
                    pension, the benefits far outweigh anything in the Foreign Service because the
                    military offers possibilities not only for the PX (Post Exchange) and the
                    commissary at Fort Myer and Walter Reed Hospital, but for free trips to Europe
                    on cargo planes or anywhere you can go out of Dover Air Force Base, which my
                    wife and I are planning for next week, by the way. So I stayed in the Reserve
                    and earned 20 years, making me eligible for benefits at age 60 as a lieutenant
                    colonel.</p>
                <p>To digress a bit, during the 15 years that I lived and worked in Europe as a
                    Foreign Service Officer and as a Department of Defense employee, almost every
                    year I took my two weeks training at Oberammergau with my wife, staying in
                    Garmisch. She would enjoy the mountains while I spent the day in class. It made
                    a wonderful vacation. We even flew once to Fort Leavenworth to complete Command
                    and General Staff College.</p>
                <p>Now, back from my digression, I'm at Yale in the second half of sophomore year,
                    in September 1946, where they looked at my record and told me that since I had
                    the GI bill I didn't need a scholarship. The GI Bill also made a difference in
                    my life.</p>
                <p>Q: You got extra, didn't you, if you were overseas or something? I don't
                    remember. I got it for the Korean War, which was essentially the same as
                    yours.</p>
                <p>MASON: Well, in my case it was simply a month for each month of service plus 12
                    more, making 38 months altogether in my case. I don't believe serving overseas
                    made a difference. I finished at Yale in June of 1948 with two years remaining
                    on the GI Bill.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you majoring in at Yale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: I majored in sociology. Originally, I'd wanted to be a lawyer. But I was
                    lured away by my interest in foreign countries. As they say, “How do you keep
                    them down on the farm after they have seen gay Paris?” I'd never dreamed of
                    getting into the Foreign Service because Waterbury, Connecticut is hardly a
                    center of culture and world affairs, and I'd never met a Foreign Service
                    Officer, let alone an ambassador. I didn't feel I had the social graces I would
                    need to be a diplomat. However, I did take a course under a very famous French
                    professor, Henri Peyre, on French 20th century literature - reading Proust,
                    Gide, Giono, Malraux, and others. So when an opportunity arose to go to the
                    Sorbonne at government expense (there was no tuition, so the government had
                    nothing to pay except the $75 a month living allowance, which was a nice
                    stipend), it was an opportunity not to be ignored, and I took it. Besides, I had
                    an opportunity to take the Foreign Service Exam over a three day period in New
                    York. I made a passing grade with no preparation, and my French was still
                    shaky.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, my parents were not too favorably disposed to having me leave, and
                    I have felt guilty about it throughout my life. My father had had a serious
                    operation and was a semi-invalid. I could have stayed in Waterbury, in the brass
                    industry without any particular backing. Some of my father's friends would have
                    helped, and perhaps I would have amounted to something in business. But I
                    dreaded that fate, and since I wasn't really needed at home, I did go.</p>
                <p>I sailed on the SS Washington, in October 1948 and immatriculated at the
                    Sorbonne. Through Yale professors I knew I lived at a pension de famille on the
                    rue d'Assas, the Pension Domecq, and where I sat at one of three or four long
                    tables with a half dozen professors and their wives who were going to the
                    Bibliotheque Nationale every day to do research on French literature or history
                    during their sabbatical year. There were students there too, an assortment of
                    respectable, well-behaved people, and there were interesting discussions, always
                    in French, which was how I became fluent. There, as I looked across the table
                    one day, I saw a young lady whom I found very attractive. I didn't say anything
                    to her, but it turned out that on Armistice day, the 11th of November, there was
                    no particular seating arrangement, and I found myself sitting next to her. I
                    asked her, “Would you like to go out, go to a movie? And then take a walk around
                    Paris?”</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>She agreed, and we went onto the Champs-Elysees, where they were having a riot.
                    There was a general strike and the Communists were picking up paving stone
                    blocks - the Champs-Elysees still had paving stones and when you got one up the
                    others would come up, too - and throwing them at the police. Cafe chairs and
                    tables were used to make barricades, heads were bloodied and we had our baptism
                    of fire in a sense. She (Genevi�ve) seemed a very nice girl, and we went out
                    just about every evening for the next 10 or 20 days, when I asked her to marry
                    me. We're in our 52nd year of marriage right now. She was working for TWA at the
                    time. She was from Marseille, and like myself, she was an only child. Each of us
                    was on his own, trying to make his way in the world, and we decided to join
                    forces and make it together. We married in 1950 at the American Church in Paris,
                    on the Quai d'Orsay, and at the Mairie du Sixi�me Arrondissement in a civil
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>After our marriage, we lived just outside of Paris teaching English in a French
                    school for the 1950-51 school year. This was a struggle because disciplining the
                    kids was no fun, our accommodations were primitive, and our means were
                    limited.</p>
                <p>We did return to the States after waiting weeks for my wife's permanent visa in
                    Marseille, at my father-in-law's home. We took passage on a ship called the
                    Corsica, which had been the private yacht of the Kaiser, complete with marble
                    staircase. But it was an old tub now, carrying Greek refugees from the Greek
                    Civil War to Canada. These poor people were in steerage, and they were being
                    dumped in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the month of November on their way to
                    Winnipeg. I felt sorry for them, but it was a chance to see what it had been
                    like for immigrants in the 19th century. After 19 days at sea, no less, I
                    brought my wife past the Statue of Liberty and into New York harbor, almost as I
                    myself had done in 1946.</p>
                <p>I'd come to Paris to write. I was interested in world affairs, but above all
                    else, I wanted to be a writer. I wrote two 60,000 word novels in the first two
                    years, 1948-49 and 1949-50, plus at least a dozen or two dozen short stories
                    without selling anything. In summer of 1950, just as the Korean War was
                    starting, I'd had no contact with the Army Reserve since coming to Paris, and
                    wasn't even sure they knew where I was. At least they never called me up. I kept
                    on writing, and just before our wedding I finished a story which eventually,
                    after many months of effort, was sold to Argosy Magazine as an adventure story.
                    This meant that I could go home with my bride with at least something to show
                    for my efforts. I didn't have a degree from the Sorbonne, and I'm not sure a
                    degree would have done me any good, because when it came to entering the Foreign
                    Service, it was just the fact that I knew France and could speak French that
                    counted. In the summer of 1951, in Germany, I did have two tours of duty back to
                    back - in class at the Intelligence School in Oberammergau and as an
                    intelligence analyst in Heidelberg, having transferred to Military Intelligence
                    Reserve in 1948.</p>

                <p>MASON: In the Reserve, still as a second lieutenant. It was already six years
                    since I had been commissioned. I was 25. We went first to Oberammergau, to the
                    Intelligence School for two weeks. Then to Heidelberg Military Post as an
                    intelligence analyst for two weeks. There I made what was debatably a serious
                    mistake. The major offered me a job as a GS-7, and a chance to live in Germany
                    with my wife indefinitely. But I had my sights on a writing career, and said,
                    “No, I'm going back to the States to become a writer.” I had just published one
                    story and of course others would follow. I'd already missed a chance to take the
                    oral exam for the Foreign Service in Washington in order to pursue a writing
                    career. But I had had one Foreign Service experience while a student. I had
                    registered in at the embassy and I was offered a temporary job, along with up to
                    a dozen other students with a similar background as messenger boys at the
                    embassy during the Council of Foreign Ministers Number Seven, which ended the
                    Berlin Blockade and started NATO. I remember seeing Dean Acheson, Foster Dulles,
                    Philip Jessup, Robert Murphy and other ambassadors. My function was to work at
                    night with a mimeograph machine helping turn out the minutes of the session for
                    the delegates to read the following day. Again I had a great piece of luck,
                    because one of the delegates was a lawyer named Goldthwaite Dorr. He was a
                    distinguished elderly gentleman with a goatee, who'd been given the assignment
                    of visiting Athens and Ankara to brief King Paul in Athens and the Turkish
                    government in Ankara on what had happened at the conference. He was flying in
                    General Clay's C-47, a Gooneybird.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the C-47. The C-54 was the four engine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, that's right, the C-47, the two engine, sitting in bucket seats.
                    Since he was the only passenger, he opened it up to a certain number of us. We
                    all signed up, and I was number two or three. So, I was chosen to go. One of the
                    others was Bob Jones, who ended up in USIA with me. I didn't see him again for
                    20 years, when I ran into him in Vietnam. It was a fabulous experience to land
                    in Athens with a government vehicle and driver at our disposal and drive to the
                    Mycenean ruins near Argos, home of Agamemnon and site of the Oresteia, which I
                    now knew thoroughly.</p>
                <p>When I got back to the States, I went to the literary agent who had sold my
                    story. Her name was Ad Schulberg. She was the mother of Budd Schulberg the
                    author, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Budd Schulberg, who wrote What Makes Sammy Run?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Right, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And his father was one of the heads of the major studios
                        iHollywood, one of the big moguls.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MASON: I didn't know that. Anyway, she was very favorably impressed with my story
                    and I was going to write a lot more of them. My wife and I set up in Bridgeport,
                    Connecticut because it was near New York and I didn't want to go back to
                    Waterbury and work in the brass industry. Besides, Bridgeport had a great
                    variety of industries, and I could always get temporary jobs, for a few weeks or
                    months, while I wrote, which I did. But I didn't sell any of the stories. I
                    never sold another story, which was a real disaster for me. My wife was working
                    at the University of Bridgeport, in the language lab while I worked in a steel
                    mill turning out hot and cold rolled steel from the open hearth and I learned a
                    lot about the American working man. That job lasted sixmonths, part of which was
                    during the great strike that Truman ended by nationalizing the steel
                    industry.</p>
                <p>When the strike was over, my job in the steel industry was over too. I wrote for
                    a while, then I went to the employment office and took a job in another mill and
                    worked there for six weeks, as long as it lasted. Then in the summer of 1953,
                    after I had already been there a year and a half, I got a job with a tree
                    climbing outfit, men who could throw a line over a branch and haul themselves up
                    into a tree. I was the ground man, not a climber. But I wrote stories about the
                    experience, and 30 years later I sold one of them to Yankee Magazine. The story
                    was due to come out, and I waited. After two years I dropped in on them in
                    Dublin, New Hampshire and asked about it. They said they would look into it and
                    they wrote back to me saying, “There have been changes up here” and so on and so
                    forth. They had paid me $450, I believe. They gave me back the rights but never
                    published it. I would gladly have given up the money to have had the story
                    published. Maybe it will be someday.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was again a failure as a writer, if you judge success by being
                    published, and how else can you judge it? I had looked down my nose at some of
                    the slicks and the stories that would appear in these magazines, and I didn't
                    even consider that the one I had sold in 1951 was basically an adventure story.
                    In Paris at the Vincennes Zoo, I had seen a hybrid lion and tiger, which the
                    French call a “tigron” which was known as a tiglon in the United States. I wrote
                    a story about a brass man from Waterbury who had hunted animals all over the
                    world and had acquired this tiglon for the zoo which his father had created. It
                    was his proudest accomplishment. The hybrid beast from the opposite ends of the
                    earth was a metaphor for the working people of Waterbury. One day the beast
                    escapes and terrorizes the town until they call in the local Army Reserve unit
                    and finally find it hiding in a sewer, where they shoot it down with machine
                    guns. The President of the brass company is devastated because there isn't even
                    enough left to make a skin of it. I had used Blake's poem, “Tiger, Tiger,
                    Burning Bright,” And, of course, Argosy, which bought it, did not use that.
                    “What mortal hand or eye dare frame thy fearful symmetry?” You see? This is the
                    question I was asking in my story. “Did He who made the lamb make thee?” The
                    environmentalists would love it.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Anyway, I had given up trying to write full time. I had to get a permanent job
                    somewhere and write in my spare time. I remembered the job back in Heidelberg
                    they had offered me, and - this was during the McCarthy years - wondered whether
                    to try to get into the Foreign Service after all. I was reaching age 31, which
                    was the cutoff date then. But I had a foreign wife, and I understood you had to
                    get permission to enter with a foreign wife. Then I looked at the “Who Lost
                    China” case. Coincidentally, I had the occasion a few weeks ago to talk with
                    Robert Service on the telephone. I had never met him but I asked if he was the
                    son of John Stewart Service, because in 1974 when I was working at the State
                    Department in Media Services, I attended a luncheon on the eighth floor where
                    Barbara Tuchman was speaking about the China years and Stilwell, maybe that was
                    the tie in. I don't know, but at the end of their talk they introduced John
                    Stewart Service, who was being rehabilitated after his shameful treatment at the
                    State Department. It was an emotional moment for me. I remembered that his
                    experience was one reason that I didn't try to go into the Foreign Service in
                    the 1950s, in addition to the fact that my father was an invalid, and I couldn't
                    accept being sent just anywhere in the world and not be able to come back easily
                    in case anything should happen to him. I remember Dean Acheson saying, “I will
                    not turn my back on Alger Hiss,” without really knowing whether he was guilty or
                    innocent and thought this was what a gentleman should do: stand up for one of
                    his owBut that is not the way they treated John Stewart Service and the other
                    China hands. I asked myself, “Is this what our government is like? Is this what
                    bureaucracy does to us? The novel I have just published, Hostage to Fortune, is
                    in large part about bureaucracies and CYA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “CYA” meaning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: “Cover your ass.” Instead of trying for the State Department again, my
                    wife and I put our savings together and went back to Europe to look for a job.
                    We sailed on the Andrea Dorea, in September 1954. It was a magnificent crossing
                    on a fine ship. We were in the tourist class, with a deck of our own, a swimming
                    pool and fine food. We sailed past the Azores, a whole day of passing one island
                    after another, then through the Straight of Gibraltar, into the Bay of Naples
                    and then to Cannes and Genoa. We disembarked in Genoa and took a train to
                    Marseille and stayed with my wife's parents for what turned out to be much
                    longer than I had intended.</p>
                <p>I left my wife there with her parents and went up to Paris to look for a job. I
                    signed up in the Army personnel office in the rue Vernet near the Arc de
                    Triomphe. They were creating the Army Supply Line (called the Communication
                    Zone) to the Seventh Army in Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I filled out the forms, but there was no promise of anything. Then, an enormous
                    piece of luck, which again made me want to get into the Foreign Service after
                    all. My wife's great grandfather, who was a Greek citizen from the Dalmatian
                    coast, was named Slavick. When the canal opened in 1870, he had been able to
                    establish himself directly on the canal in Port-Said and found a ship chandler's
                    company: James S. Slavick and Company, which was still in existence. He was
                    dead, of course, and his widow, who was an Austrian, had run the company for
                    many years, and now it was in the hands of the next generation, my wife's Greek
                    great-uncle, who died in the early 1950s, but whom I had met at the time of our
                    wedding in France, and his wife, who was my wife's American great-aunt. She was
                    named Hilda Barnes, from Elmira, New York, and as American as you can be and
                    still live in Port-Said, Egypt. When she was in her late 70s, she had come to
                    our wedding. Every summer she would take a ship to Marseille and a train to
                    Paris and Le Havre and sail directly to the United States and visit her family
                    in Elmira. But after the revolution in Egypt, her funds were blocked, preventing
                    her from going, and so when she heard we were back in Marseille, she offered us
                    a trip to Port-Said with money she could spend in Egypt but nowhere else.</p>
                <p>So in December of 1954 my wife and I boarded the Ionia, one of three ships, with
                    the Aeolia and the Corinthia, owned and run by a Greek line, and were treated to
                    a magnificent tour through the Straight of Messina and the Corinth Canal, with
                    less than a yard of room on either side for the ship. We spent a day in Athens
                    and then sailed directly to Alexandria for a few hours, then back up to
                    Limassol, Cyprus, and over to Beirut, where we grabbed a taxi, which was how
                    travel was conducted, and with several Arab travelers drove to Damascus. We
                    visited the city and the Mosque of the Omeyades. Then from Beirut we sailed to
                    Port Said, where we stayed with my wife's Aunt Hilda for six weeks, including
                    the Christmas holidays, at which time she took us to Cairo and sent us on a tour
                    of Upper Egypt. So we saw Luxor, Karnak, the Valley of the Kings, and Aswan from
                    the Cataract Hotel. We stayed in close contact with her until her death in 1968
                    at age 96. She didn't have anything to leave us, since the house was owned by
                    the Slavick family, and was divided among several family members. But my wife's
                    father owned a quarter of it, and just three years ago, after his death, we were
                    able to sell our share after negotiations with a lawyer in Alexandria. At Hilda
                    Slavick's home, in 1954, we had met the American Consul in Port Said, whose name
                    was Curtis Jones. Is he still alive?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, he is down in North Carolina, I think. He has
                        beeinterviewed by the program.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MASON: Really, I would like to run into him again and talk to him. I was a green
                    kid at the time, and I still hadn't had a permanent job in the government or
                    anywhere else. So, after those six weeks we came back to Marseille, where a
                    letter was waiting for me saying they were “considering” me, as they always say
                    when they are ready to offer a job, as a training officer in one of the depots
                    being set up to supply the Seventh Army in Germany with the various items and
                    material they needed. There were signal depots, engineer depots, quartermaster
                    depots, and so on across France in a line from La Rochelle and other ports on
                    the west coast up past the headquarters at Orleans and into Germany.</p>
                <p>The Base Section was near the ports, and the Advance Section was in Northeastern
                    France. I reported to our personnel office in Nancy in the middle of winter,
                    again without my wife, and was assigned to the Signal Depot in Verdun as a GS-7
                    with a salary of $4, 205 plus a 10% differential, which shows you how hard up I
                    was. Verdun was the heroic city of World War I, but it was snowed in when I
                    visited the place and the depot was deep in mud on the other side of the Meuse
                    River. There was a colonel in command of a few warehouses and the beginnings of
                    what they called the Stock Control section, where huge computers filled a large
                    room. This was how they kept track of the signal equipment being stored or sent
                    to the Seventh Army in Germany. I spent two years there with my wife conducting
                    supervisory and technical training to the employees. We met a family whose
                    sister lived in Marseilles and was a friend of my wife's mother, and so we had a
                    contact there. They had a couple of rooms on the third floor under the roof of
                    their house in Verdun, with a pot belly coal stove. You could only heat one
                    room, the living room, and the bedroom had no heat. The bathtub was a sit-down
                    tub next to the kitchen sink. This is where we lived after six months in a hotel
                    room. You would climb a spiral staircase to get up to our apartment, but we
                    considered ourselves lucky and spent the next year and a half there. I was
                    promoted to GS-9 toward the end of that time, but as you can imagine I was not
                    anxious to spend the rest of my career in Verdun.</p>
                <p>In the civil service, I'm sure you know, a job is created and you are put into it
                    if you are the best qualified on paper. But unless there is a vacancy or the job
                    itself is upgraded, you don't get promoted. My job had just been upgraded, but
                    even so... As the Supervisory Training Officer, I had been setting up a training
                    program, teaching English to the French, for which I wrote my own texts, and
                    finding teachers for technical subjects. I had complete freedom and I think I
                    did a pretty good job at it. But when I heard of a vacancy at the civilian
                    personnel office in Paris, I applied and got it. I was about to move to Paris
                    when my father died. We rushed back to the States, though there were no jets as
                    yet and the flight took over 24 hours. My parents were living in Fort
                    Lauderdale, and we spent a month with my mother there. Fortunately, I was able
                    to go back to the job in Paris without a break in service and spent another two
                    years there. I had applications out at the USIA and other agencies, but with a
                    job already in Paris, I knew I was lucky.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>But the job wasn't what I'd hoped it would be, and after six months to a year in
                    Paris, it was cut out (RIFed) and I was about to be sent to the headquarters in
                    Orleans to a job which was only a GS7. I was very unhappy about that. But I had
                    joined an Army Reserve unit, the Paris USAR School, and was attending meetings
                    with people working at EUCOM - the US European Command - with headquarters at
                    Camp des Loges, some of whom were intelligence analysts. The EUCOM area was
                    Europe, the Middle East and Africa. So I asked and was told to try the
                    subordinate headquarters in Germany, the Air force in Ramstein, USAFE (United
                    States Air Force in Europe), and in Heidelberg, the Army USAREUR, where they
                    wrote strategic estimates and reports on political developments in the countries
                    in their area.</p>
                <p>I went to three offices, and the one I liked best was Ramstein, between
                    Kaiserslautern and Saarbrucken. They gave me a test and offered me a job as a
                    GS-9. I jumped at it. I didn't lose my grade, though I still had a lot of
                    catching-up to do. By then I was 32 or 33 years old, and a GS9 is only the
                    equivalent of a six or seven in the Foreign Service. I loved it. It was great
                    work. I was the only political analyst covering France and its colonies in
                    Africa: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Sub-Saharan Africa, plus the Belgian
                    Congo, at the time of their independence. I covered the Algerian War. I covered
                    the end of the Moroccan Liberation Movement. I also covered the chaotic events
                    in Congo-Leopoldville.</p>

                <p>MASON: I was doing this from 1959 to 1965. Those were the criticayears, during
                    decolonization. In my novel, I have drawn on all of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were doing these analyses, what did they get
                        into?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MASON: We received articles from the State Department's INR and from other
                    sources, and I would debrief the air attaches as they passed through. We did
                    current intelligence, midterm intelligence, and long term intelligence. We
                    contributed to the National Intelligence Survey, which was the permanent stuff
                    on the geography of a country and such, and especially to the National
                    Intelligence Estimates. I had about 40 countries altogether, because I spoke
                    French. I was not in the Soviet area at all. Other fellows were doing that.
                    Military officers were doing the hardware: the military capabilities of the
                    countries. I didn't have to worry about that. I was in the coup business. I
                    remember in early 1961 I got a phone call about 2:00 A.M. (By this time the
                    headquarters had moved to Wiesbaden) saying, “Get down here, Mohamed V has just
                    died,” in Morocco. I rushed down to the office and was told to write an estimate
                    immediately, which I did from my personal knowledge. I'd had one trip to Rabat,
                    for just a couple of days, and that was the sum total of my experience in
                    Morocco. At the same time, I had been covering Morocco for a year and a half. So
                    I thought I had a pretty good idea of what it was like. It was my first
                    opportunity to write an estimate of my own. But my military bosses (and I think
                    I can tell you this now at a distance of 40 or 45 years) told me, “That Moulay
                    Hassan, he's a playboy. He even slugged Prime Minister Ibrahim once in a cabinet
                    meeting or something. He's not going to last, we give him six months.” So I had
                    to agree. Well, Hassan just died last year, after a successful reign of almost
                    40 years during which he restored order, survived two attempts on his life, and
                    steered Morocco on a pro-Western course as a leader of one of the moderate Arab
                    states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but he did have that reputation of being after girls
                        anboys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: No doubt he did. But that was his personal life. We never saw a picture of
                    his wife or his family. We knew that his sisters, Lalla Aicha and the others
                    were off leading lives of their own. But he was a much stronger figure than his
                    father had been. He really ran the country.</p>
                <p>To continue, as pilots, my bosses had to get their flying time in. They would
                    either fly to Wheelus in Libya and bomb at the Al Watiah bombing range, or else
                    to Morocco, anywhere to get the flying time in. I spent four years, 1959-1963,
                    covering those areas and the Congo too, Leopoldville at the time, and our first
                    ambassador there - Timberlake, Clare Timberlake. Followed by Gullion, the
                    Congolese leaders being Tschomb�, Gisenga, Kasavubu, and Lumumba, and then
                    Mobutu. And I wrote daily estimates based on reports from our defense attaches
                    and others because we had a four star general in Wiesbaden, who needed to know
                    whether he was going to have to send an airlift down there or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we did send one, I think the year after you left.
                        DragoRouge, we took Belgian paratroopers in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes. Later, in 1967, I was working in USIS Paris for MaKraus, who was the
                    last American out of Stanleyville - Kisangani.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>There and in Paris I was getting my Reserve training. Since 1957, I realized that
                    I had only a certain number of years to stay in the service and that if I was to
                    earn my 50 points for each year and end up with 20 good years, I needed to get
                    busy. So I took extension courses in strategic intelligence and Defense
                    Management, given by the Industrial College at Fort McNair. I attended the Paris
                    USAR School and then while I worked in Germany from 1959 to 1963 the Frankfurt
                    USAR School, which had a branch in Wiesbaden. Every summer we went to
                    Oberammergau for training, and in 1968 we went to Fort Leavenworth to finish a
                    three or four year course at the Command and General Staff College conducted in
                    Paris or Frankfurt.</p>
                <p>I also took one two-week tour of active duty in Orleans, in the Communications
                    Zone (COMZ) headquarters, in 1961, when the French colonels in Algiers were
                    running their attempted coup d'�tat. Generals Salan, Jouhaux, Zeller, and Challe
                    tried a coup, and Paris was waiting for troopers to drop, but thanks to
                    DeGaulle, who knew how to handle it and the loyal draftees, it did not happen. I
                    also had a tour in 1962 at EUCOM headquarters, in J2 division. There my first
                    boss was Colonel Raymond Davis, a Congressional Medal of Honor Winner, who led
                    the Marines out of the Cho-San Reservoir area in North Korea. He became deputy
                    commandant of the Marine Corps and a four star general. I returned there to a
                    permanent job in 1963, four years after moving to Germany, as an analyst at
                    EUCOM headquarters. The work was less interesting. We analysts sat in a large
                    bull pen and were assigned articles. But still, it was not that bad. But there
                    was a problem on clearances in France, because of my French-born wife, even
                    though she'd become an American citizen in 1959, and I had to think of a way
                    out. Since there was a Public Affairs job in Paris, handling all the public
                    affairs for the troops in the Paris area, and since I was a GS-11 by that time,
                    I accepted it. Nevertheless, I was 39 years old as a GS-11, which still isn't a
                    high grade in the Foreign Service. So I kept looking around for a new
                    opportunity. I met the mayors of the towns around Paris, Garches, and St. Cloud
                    and developed contacts in the Paris, St. Germain, and Fontainebleau area. I took
                    my military boss's job as Public Affairs Officer after he left and held it until
                    General de Gaulle asked us to leave at the end of 1966. But again I was in luck.
                    One of my Paris contacts was Howard Simpson, Information Officer at the embassy,
                    and when there was a book fair at the Maison des Jeunes et de la Culture in
                    St.Germain-en-Laye near our headquarters, I asked Howard, who had authored
                    several novels, to come out.</p>
                <p>With him was Larry Wylie, the Cultural Affairs Officer at the embassy, a Harvard
                    professor and an expert on France. He'd written a book called Village in the
                    Vaucluse, a sociological study about a town not very far from Avignon. Then,
                    there was Olivia de Haviland, who had just published her autobiography called
                    Every Frenchman Has One, a lovely title. (She was referring to her husband,
                    Pierre Galant, and his liver trouble.) She proved as charming as she could be.
                    My wife and I took her out and squired her around and she was the star of the
                    book fair. And also, James Jones, author of From Here to Eternity, who was
                    living on the Ile-St. Louis, and whom I'd gotten to know after interviewing him.
                    Later, he wrote a novel about the student uprising in 1968, entitled The Merry
                    Month of May.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We had those four, and so when a few months later we were told we would be
                    leaving. (I had been offered a job as a GS-12 at the EUCOM Public Affairs Office
                    headquarters in Germany. My German was not that fluent, and though I think I
                    could have made it more fluent, I was not that confident.) So I also asked
                    Howard if there was a job in USIA. He looked around and talked it over with Lee
                    Brady, his Public Affairs Officer, and Lee's deputy Serban Vallimarescu. They
                    made up a team for the oral exam: Vallimarescu, John Reid, who was deputy
                    Cultural Affairs Officer, and Phil McMains, who was the Admin Officer, and they
                    interrogated me for an hour or two. I remember one question they asked me, this
                    being late 1966, “Would you be willing to go to Vietnam?” I gulped and answered,
                    “Well, I'm not anxious to go, because I saw what happened to the French Army in
                    Vietnam and in Algeria, and I don't think we are going to make it if the French
                    couldn't.” But if that was it, I couldn't refuse. You have to take the bitter
                    with the sweet. So I gave up the possibility of the job in Stuttgart and was
                    assigned to the Paris embassy under Chip Bohlen, Lee Brady, and Val
                    Vallimarescu, and Howard Simpson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into USIA in when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Laterally, on the 12th of March 1967, which was the date of our departure
                    from the Camp des Loges and the end of our military presence in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are now in 1967, you have joined USIA. Your first tour
                        wawhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: In Paris. Paris was where I'd been living anyway for four years in two or
                    three different jobs. So, when the military moved out in March of 1967, I was
                    ready to go right down to the embassy and the job of Deputy Information Officer
                    as a Class V officer in the Limited Reserve. USIA at that time didn't offer
                    either career Foreign Service status or Civil Service status, and so we were
                    attaches only. I had sacrificed, in a sense, my civil service status to do this
                    because, I thought, I was at last getting into the Foreign Service and felt my
                    experience and age qualified me.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>USIS was in the Rothschild building on the rue du Faubourg St. Honor� at the
                    time. It is now the ambassador's residence. Howard Simpson stayed for another
                    three months and was replaced by Max Kraus, and we moved into the Hotel
                    Talleyrand, on rue St. Florentin and rue de Rivoli, on the corner opposite the
                    main embassy building. I was there for two years. It was hectic, but it was
                    interesting work. A lot of donkey work, dragging people around - visitors and
                    such. I was frequently called on for that sort of thing, but I was also assigned
                    as the Vietnam Information Officer, never having been to Vietnam, never even
                    having had an orientation at USIA. Apparently, you were expected to know or find
                    out everything about your assignment with no guidance from above. My career had
                    started off in Verdun as a supervisory training officer and we went through many
                    texts and examples of what to do and what not to do to be a good supervisor, how
                    to train and prepare your employees, and I felt that USIA was not doing that. I
                    never did have an assignment at USIA in Washington, until my very last one, 17
                    years later. Throughout my career with USIA in fact, I know that I was not being
                    adequately prepared for each assignment. That's the first criticism I would have
                    of it.</p>
                <p>But I enjoyed seeing the big operators from Washington come through Paris. I took
                    Averell Harriman through the Talleyrand because this had been his headquarters
                    when he headed the Marshall Plan, ICA. His office was a huge ornate corner room
                    occupied at that time by Lee Brady, our Public Affairs Officer (And I'm told it
                    is now sealed off and empty as being too risky in case of an attack. Too bad.).
                    He recorded a talk there for the Voice of America. President Nixon came through
                    in his first visit overseas after his inauguration at the end of February 1969.
                    I was one of the interpreters at the formal dinner at the Elys�es Palace, and I
                    was assigned to Mr. Kissinger. I sat behind him and the wife of a French
                    Senator, and listened to the chit chat, which did not interest Mr. Kissinger.
                    But it was an experience to be there at the table and hear General de Gaulle
                    welcome President Nixon and have Nixon get up and give what was really a very,
                    very fine speech. “We come to sit at your feet and learn,” was the gist of it,
                    which is not what de Gaulle had been getting from the Johnson Administration,
                    and this, of course, pleased the French no end.</p>
                <p>Behind him was General Walters, the Defense Attache, who was his interpreter.
                    General Walters did not take notes. He would wait until an entire paragraph was
                    completed before he would repeat the whole thing perfectly in French, to my
                    great admiration. I worked with General Walters, in the sense that if I got
                    queries from press people about Vietnam, I would send them to him or see what
                    the army attach� or naval attach� or the people in their office could do to help
                    them and brief them. So I was in there trying to defend American policy, which I
                    didn't entirely agree with, but I did the best I could, without even the
                    experience of having been in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Once the Sorbonne organized a debate outside Paris on the subject of Vietnam. The
                    speakers included Olivier Todd, a left wing journalist in France, very much in
                    the news himself and much liked by the students just before the 1968 student
                    uprising at the Sorbonne in May of 1968.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>It was just after the Tet Offensive and I was defending American policy and the
                    truth was that we had won the battle militarily but lost it politically. I still
                    maintain that in winning it we wiped out the Vietcong but left the North
                    Vietnamese to fill the vacuum. They were coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and
                    I still wonder if we couldn't have arrived at a negotiated solution with the
                    Vietcong, who were Southerners themselves and as much anti-Northerner as the
                    pro-American Thieu Government. Anyway, that is water over the dam. Back and
                    forth this argument went and tough questions were asked. I don't know how well I
                    did, but one student did come up to me afterwards and say, “You know, sir, back
                    at the Sorbonne, there are quite a few of us who agree with you. But we don't
                    dare say so.” So much for freedom of speech at the Sorbonne. Anyway, this is the
                    sort of thing I was thrown into without any experience, training, or
                    orientation.</p>
                <p>I did have a background in intelligence, where of course you don't talk about
                    anything outside the office. In the local affairs with the mayors of the Paris
                    arrondissements and of the surrounding communities, it was entirely cultural. It
                    was not a political information program. I learned a great deal from this. Our
                    ambassador was Chip Bohlen for the first year, and then Sargent Shriver. Bohlen
                    was the perfect professional and Shriver was the political innovator who did
                    unconventional things. I remember taking Eunice Shriver to visit a school for
                    handicapped children, since this was one of her main interests, and I
                    interpreted for her there. These were not substantive jobs, in that - well, I
                    did interview journalists who knew a great deal about Vietnam and I reported on
                    what they had said, which got up through channels into various parts of the
                    embassy. So I learned a great deal, especially about Vietnam, before I went
                    there.</p>
                <p>Q: I would like though, Ted, if we could go back to Paris. What happened, were
                    you involved in the student protest, the disappearance of De Gaulle? Sort of
                    wondering what was going to happen...</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MASON: Yes, we were covering it from day to day. I remember when he went to
                    Germany to Baden-Baden to talk with Massu. We thought, “Uh-oh, this could end
                    with the French army moving in and taking over.” At the same time the students
                    had taken over the Sorbonne building and the Od�on Theater. In fact, I went to
                    one of their get-togethers at the Od�on. It was conducted in a heady atmosphere,
                    with each student romantically imagining himself on the Barricades during a new
                    French Revolution. They were all screaming at cross purposes, as if there had
                    never been any free speech in France before. One was saying “Let's try the
                    Yugoslav way of doing things,” and another said, “Let's try something else!” It
                    was what you would expect from students. I remember how de Gaulle waited, very
                    cleverly and very wisely waited them out and finally moved in at three in the
                    morning in various places and took over their strongholds with a minimum of
                    bloodshed. By that time the students had run out of steam. But before then when
                    they were first tearing things apart, they tore down the superstructure of the
                    metro openings, you know, in the Quartier Latin. I remember that I was duty
                    officer that weekend and again, Mrs. Shriver wanted to see it and show it to her
                    kids. I took them around and showed them the damage. With my wife, I had been
                    out there and seen what they were doing from a safe distance. The police were
                    very restrained, there was no breaking of heads. There was no Kent State. And it
                    worked, it really did. Now, Cohn-Bendit is actually back in there as a member of
                    the European parliament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Known as “Rudy the Red” at one time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes. He can't decide whether he has French or Germanationality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's from Alsace perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: No, I think he is from Germany proper, but his family came to France as
                    refugees in the 1930s. He's in the Green Movement now and before the French
                    elections, a year or two ago, he was seen quite often on television and has
                    become quite respectable. No, all of this was something I followed with great
                    interest because I had been covering French politics as an intelligence analyst
                    for years, you see, and all the colonial troubles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there real apprehension that the French army might
                        move iand if they did what might this mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MASON: I think there was. There was a feeling of suspense, but I don't know if it
                    was more so than the feeling in April 1961 when the French Colonels, Salan,
                    Jouhaux, Zeller, and Challe in Algiers set up their little regime. There people
                    were afraid of paratroopers landing south of Paris. That was very touch and go.
                    But it didn't happen, again because de Gaulle was able to rally the contingent,
                    that is to say the draftees in the French army, who would have resisted an order
                    from those colonels to move. I think those two events were of somewhat equal
                    importance. And in between them, of course, there were how many assassination
                    attempts against de Gaulle personally? There was Petit Clamart, and there was
                    the one on the way to Colombey les-Deux-Eglises, and another one down in Toulon
                    and so on. Those were exciting days in Paris, and in both cases I believe direct
                    intervention by the Army would have led to a blood bath and tarnished de
                    Gaulle's reputation. As it was, having extricated France from the Algerian
                    morass, it was a great humiliation for him now to see his work turned against
                    him by students who had not been out of their cribs in the late 1950s and early
                    1960s. I guess he felt he was on the way out. The question that I always asked
                    was why he dispensed with the services of Pompidou as prime minister just at
                    that time and brought in Couve de Murville. Was it to let Pompidou keep his
                    hands clean so that he could succeed de Gaulle more easily? Because the
                    elections took place in the June of 1969, and de Gaulle didn't run. He moved
                    back into retirement and Pompidou won. And that is just when I left. So I
                    concluded my service in France with the departure of the General.</p>
                <p>At the end of two years in June of 1969 I was brought back to Washington and to
                    the Vietnam Training Center at Arlington Towers, where I attended lectures that
                    lasted two or three months. We had top flight speakers like Herman Kahn of the
                    Hudson Institute, and experts like Chester Bain, who wrote a book on Vietnam.
                    These were some of the people who helped us to flesh the subject out very
                    thoroughly. So I can't say that I wasn't prepared to go to Vietnam and I
                    appreciated that. I asked to be in the press office because of my French,
                    thinking I could deal with the French press better than some of the others. But
                    no, I was assigned as Reports Officer of JUSPAO (Joint U.S. Public Affairs
                    Office). JUSPAO was in the Rex building downtown. I arrived the first of October
                    of 1969 in Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the situation in South Vietnam, at
                        thtime that you got there in October of 1969?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: We considered, in spite of what the press was saying, that we had won the
                    Tet Offensive, so what was going on was not an immediate danger to Saigon. I
                    remember that people would climb onto the roofs of their buildings to watch what
                    looked like heat lightning way off in the distance but was in fact artillery
                    fire. I remember that there was one that landed on a tennis court at the
                    Sporting Club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...The tennis court. I was a member of the Cercle
                        Sportif.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MASON: I can't stand that kind of heat, lying in the sun and eveswimming is no
                    pleasure to me but that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: I was reports officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which meant what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: It was a miserable, frustrating job. On my first day, I showed up for work
                    and was told without explanation to get out the weekly report. I guess it was a
                    Friday or Saturday. I was supposed to work the entire weekend to get this report
                    out. Well, it came back to me a few days later with the comment, “This report
                    requires considerable rewriting” and so on. Of course, I hadn't had any
                    experience in writing reports to Washington, or instruction in how to do so. I
                    took the individual reports, which came from all over South Vietnam, and put
                    them together by subject, I guess, or by military region. And my great complaint
                    was what I imagine took place everywhere in Vietnam, that with an unpopular war
                    and an unpopular President who was trying to justify the war, no President would
                    want to hear bad news. So any bad news just wasn't reported as far as I could
                    see from the final reports that went forward.</p>
                <p>The only classified item in it was the number of leaflets dropped on the trail
                    that week. And what the North Vietnamese did with those leaflets, I can only
                    imagine. Another thing that I noticed was the posters put out by JUSPAO,
                    beautifully done artistic posters showing happy peasants protecting their
                    villages. One had a village silhouette in the background with a soldier from the
                    South Vietnamese army in the foreground protecting the village. But on its
                    tallest building in the distance there was a cross, just two tiny lines making a
                    cross. I said, “Since the South Vietnamese are divided between Buddhists and
                    Christians and the Buddhists greatly resent the Christians, who were converted
                    by the French and whom they consider to be pro-French, pro-American and not good
                    Vietnamese, why do we have to have a cross on this?” I was told to shut up
                    because these were approved by a committee that went over these things very
                    carefully. Well, to me this was a waste of time and money, because without the
                    cross, it could have been a good message, but with the cross, it alienated the
                    Buddhists and reinforced their feeling that the Christians were lackeys of the
                    Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Those are little things, but you could multiply them by as many cases as you
                    could think of.Then there were delays in getting the reports approved. Since
                    there were three bosses in the front office: Chief - JUSPAO, his deputy, and a
                    third man, I don't have to mention their names, it doesn't matter. They all went
                    over this report before it went out, and it was delayed and delayed. They were
                    swamped with work. They had much, much too much to do, so that by the time the
                    report went out, much of it was obsolete, or if they heard something in the
                    meantime in the field, they'd send it back to me to be checked out. Then I would
                    go back to the person in the field and he would say, “My God! I gave you this
                    report three weeks ago and it hasn't gone out yet? Naturally, things have
                    changed. Why couldn't it have gone out? I'd sent you a new report. Now I have to
                    go over this same report that I wrote before.” So there was frustration all up
                    and down the line and we were swamped in paperwork, in Saigon and in the field.
                    I found this a thankless job. I was trained to be a public affairs officer and I
                    am doing nothing but paperwork, sitting in that icebox of a JUSPAO office, and
                    sick with a cold every other day from the air-conditioning. So I asked my boss
                    if I could have a different job for my second year there and do something else
                    and not go back to the States after two years in Vietnam with nothing to show
                    for it but having written reports which were re-written before going out.</p>
                <p>They did move me and I am sure they held it against me, but I didn't mind because
                    I was made a PSYOPS - psychological operations - advisor in CORDS (Civil
                    Operations and Rural Development Support) Advisory Team 44 in Gia Dinh Province
                    (the suburbs of Saigon). Now CORDS under Bill Colby was a real working outfit.
                    Every province had a team, a Province Senior Advisor and specialists from the
                    military and the civilian side. JUSPAO was also military and civilian, the Joint
                    U.S. Public Affairs Office. But at CORDS, I was the man in charge of public
                    affairs, reporting what I thought was the truth about the rural development
                    program. My boss was one of the finest men I ever met in the Foreign Service,
                    Dave McKillop. He would call me and his Filipino assistant, Ed Navarro, after
                    our daily staff meeting, which was, I guess, 7:00 A.M. or 7:30, and Dave would
                    sit in a chair between us and we would have a cup of coffee and talk things
                    over. This, to me, was supervision the way it should be. Not the way they do
                    things in my agency, and it increased my respect for the State Department. Of
                    course, I would have preferred to be in the political section of the embassy,
                    but there were no openings, since everyone wanted to be in the political
                    cone.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>There I was with Dave McKillop, and he wrote the finest rating I have ever been
                    given. It was just outstanding. I would have gone into combat with him. He was
                    there for my first year. Actually I guess I spent 14 months, so he wasn't there
                    for a full year. He was replaced by Bob Walkinshaw, who was a labor officer,
                    since retired and I enjoyed working with him also. It was one of the best jobs I
                    have had anywhere in my career. I'm happy to have had it because it gave me the
                    possibility of going back to America, having mingled with the people and seen
                    what actually went on in the suburbs of Saigon, down to Can Gio on the South
                    China Sea, all the way down the Saigon River. There were five or six districts.
                    We had district advisors, young officers and we had the Province Senior Advisor
                    nearby and we were in daily contact with him. I saw mistakes being made. I
                    remember once, when they were about to have an election, the supervisor gave a
                    party and invited the various contending Vietnamese parties over to the house
                    for drinks. Naturally, only one or two showed up. We were interfering in their
                    election, and this was the kiss of death. So I learned a lesson there too: what
                    not to do when there are elections about to take place.</p>
                <p>I got great satisfaction in Saigon. My wife was able to get a job there since
                    according to the rules at that time, a woman who was able to get a job on her
                    own was welcome to come and live with her husband and they would make it a two
                    year tour instead of an 18 month tour with safe havening in say, Baguio, or
                    Bangkok or Hong Kong or wherever it might be. So, I had my wife with me the
                    whole time and we took short, week-long vacations every three or four months and
                    saw a great deal of Southeast Asia and that made it very tolerable. She was very
                    happy there. She sang with the Saigon Choral Society. They sang Carmina Burana
                    and The Messiah. She even taught typing to the Air Force. So she was occupied
                    and it was the perfect situation for the two of us, except for the war.</p>
                <p>Now you asked me about the feelings and the attitudes and the atmosphere when I
                    arrived in October. I described what it was in October, but then, of course, we
                    had the Cambodian incursion, which cleaned out the whole Third Corps Area.
                    Saigon was in the middle of the Third Corps Area, or third Military Region, and
                    the Vietcong there was defeateI was told the kickoff for the Tet Offensive had
                    taken place in the Hoc Mon district. The surrounding countryside had been
                    saturated with Vietcong, but not after the Cambodian incursion. I don't actually
                    know what damage we did in Cambodia. I have asked people, and I don't know if I
                    have the truth. I have the strong impression that we only bombed the Trail. We
                    didn't bomb cities or towns as such. I hope I'm right. But whatever else it did,
                    it opened the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I had a Ford Bronco and a Vietnamese assistant (whom I helped to bring his family
                    to the Los Angeles area after 1975 and with whom I'm still in contact). We could
                    drive all over the area. I drove with my wife one Sunday up to Tay Ninh on the
                    Cambodian border to see the Cao Dai Temple, and down to Vung Tau (Cap St
                    Jacques) once. By day the roads were open, which made a big difference, and gave
                    us a greater sense of security. I no longer heard the artillery at night that I
                    had heard when I first arrived there, so that when I left, I stopped in Paris in
                    the fall of 1971 to see General Walters who was still there as the Defense
                    Attach� and took a great interest in the war, and reported to him. I told him I
                    felt that unless some outside force came in, at least locally we know that the
                    people are with us and that we will be able to hang on, that Vietnamization will
                    succeed. Well, I was wrong, because Congress didn't vote the funds to keep the
                    South Vietnamese Army properly armed and their morale suffered and it went in a
                    matter of weeks, but long after American forces had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you're talking about 1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, 1975. I don't want to get into criticism there, since I had left in
                    1971. For about $35 more, we came back through Asia and stopped in as many
                    places as possible and made it a great trip. We had a few days in Kashmir on the
                    Dal Lake and in Beirut, and in Lisbon and across Puerto Rico and Florida, where
                    my mother was living. Then I was assigned to the staff and faculty at the
                    Vietnam Training Center. I was proud of that. It was a good job. I spoke to
                    groups who were going out to Vietnam following us, because they were expected to
                    go out with no let-up in the CORDS program or the other programs within the
                    provinces. We did this until the spring of 1972 when the whole thing - the
                    Vietnam Training Center - just closed down. I remember we had General Haig as a
                    speaker and at just about the time he was there, it was announced that we were
                    closing. So I had to look for another job. At USIA no offer was forthcoming. I
                    was willing to take anything, because I wanted a to know how the Agency
                    functioned. By that time I had spent four years, from 1967 to 1971 (four and a
                    half years really), without an assignment at the Agency. But I also tried the
                    State Department and lo and behold, I found a job in Media Services, part of the
                    Public Affairs section of the State Department, under Paul Auerswald, where I
                    worked with a retired Naval commander named Ed Roeder, who had done a lot of
                    television work for the Pentagon.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We started a program of sending out to the local stations around the country
                    little scripts which outlined American policy with slides. We would take
                    photographs which we would send with a text. If we happened to mention Secretary
                    Kissinger, we would send a slide of Kissinger, so that his face would appear
                    behind the speaker's face at the local station. This was good work because I was
                    able to follow policy - it could have been the Law of the Sea or any number of
                    subjects which local stations out in the Dakotas could use as they please. There
                    were a few that sent them back saying, “We don't want this propaganda, we don't
                    want handouts,” but that was their loss because we weren't forcing it down their
                    throats. We were merely saying, “This is American policy.” That is the way it
                    was for my two years spent at the Vietnam Training Center and in Public Affairs
                    at the State Department.Then I discovered to my dismay that the Agency did not
                    consider this mainline work. It was not an assignment with USIA. Well, I had a
                    great deal of trouble getting a statement of need-in other words that they
                    needed me at the Agency-because I was not doing Agency work. I was working at
                    the State Department. I had a strong feeling that when there is a war-time
                    situation and when that war is a land war, the navy still has to get involved.
                    Every service has to have its share. I felt that USIA was playing this game too.
                    That's why they had JUSPAO, the Joint U.S. Public Affairs Office, which added
                    layers and layers of people there. I can tell you one thing that caused me to be
                    looked at askance. Our Deputy Director came to town and sat in on one of our
                    staff meetings. He told us that every USIA officer coming up for a new
                    assignment would be sent to Vietnam, if he hadn't already been there, and he
                    would break the assignment of anybody who had an assignment somewhere else and
                    had not been to Vietnam. Well, a high ranking individual came from Washington,
                    USIA whom I'd met before, and he called me in and asked what we'd been told. I
                    told him, and he stared at me and said not another word. That was the end of the
                    interview. So I shouldn't have mentioned something the Agency was doing for us
                    to raise our morale!</p>
                <p>I don't think that the people with the inside track in Washington should have
                    gotten the good assignments without having gone to Vietnam. On the other hand, I
                    found that as soon as the Vietnam War was over, 1972 for us, it was a
                    disadvantage career-wise to have been in Vietnam. This is why I had trouble
                    getting a career appointment into the Agency. It took a year before they finally
                    agreed to give me an oral exam. When the exam was finally administered, I passed
                    it with flying colors and got my career status. Almost immediately I got the
                    assignment I had asked for. I'd always wanted go to North Africa. I had covered
                    the North African independence movements, and now I was assigned as Branch
                    Public Affairs officer in Casablanca.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Casablanca? I went there in June of 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MASON: June of 1978. I had two two-year tours. I extended. That was very, very
                    interesting. It was my best tour with USIA because I was my own boss, to the
                    extent that you can be when you are isolated and there is nobody else in the
                    same town. I was the only Branch PAO in Morocco. My assistant was pulled out
                    after about six months and sent to Fez to be a kind of a mini-Public Affairs
                    Officer there. I had no authority over him, but I did have the south of Morocco
                    including Marrakech as well as Casablanca, the real metropolis. It was a great
                    experience for me. I went out and met a lot of groups. I had a good loyal staff,
                    most of the time.</p>
                <p>I worked for good people. Bill Brubeck was my Consul General, and I learned there
                    that one of the qualifications for success was to be a good tennis player,
                    because the first thing he asked me was “Do you play tennis?” I had to say
                    “Sorry, no.” He was living at the Villa Mirador, where Churchill had been
                    quartered during the Casablanca conference. This magnificent home had a swimming
                    pool, where the rest of us would go on weekends for a swim. I didn't play tennis
                    but I got along with him well anyway; he turned out to be a good boss. Within a
                    year our lease ran out on the old cultural center, which was located on the rue
                    P�goud, downtown on a narrow street and in an unattractive building. It did have
                    a small theater, and a huge library-far more books than it needed. The kids
                    would pile in there and reach for books and throw them around, and it was
                    chaotic. But the landlord wanted it back.</p>
                <p>And through luck and much effort and a couple of places that didn't work out, we
                    finally found a property on the Place Bel Air, within a block or two of the
                    Consulate General and the American Language Center (which had been the Consulate
                    in the old days, before the 1970s). Our building had been the residence of the
                    Consul General during World War II- a magnificent old, thick walled villa with
                    12 or 14 foot high ceilings, a marble staircase, big rooms, and a porch off the
                    living/dining room with columns that opened onto a garden. But the building
                    itself was sadly in need of renovation.</p>
                <p>We talked to the owner. He was very happy to let us have it and the Agency sent
                    their expert on the conversion of buildings, Theodore Bork. I worked with him
                    very closely. He was a very fine fellow. I liked him and respected his
                    decisions. He had worked on hotels and then he had taken a job with the Agency
                    redoing most of our cultural centers. Over the course of a year, we turned the
                    place into a beautiful operation, with a stage in the garden. We could have
                    musical and stage performances, and we had chairs that we could put out in the
                    grass for hundreds of people. Inside the living room and the dining room were
                    separated by a partition that was not load-bearing, and so we knocked out that
                    partition and made it into what was called an MPR - a multi-purpose room. We put
                    a screen at one end and a projection booth at the other end. It was perfect. We
                    had all the chairs we needed. We had a platform for speakers and musicians. I've
                    got a photo album filed with pictures of all the work done.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>My Public Affairs Officer at the time was Jim Tull, who is now retired and living
                    near Mobile, Alabama, another very fine fellow, and a Vietnam Vet. He knew of a
                    piano, which was in the home of one of his officers, and he took it and gave it
                    to me for my cultural center, and I had visiting pianists there playing American
                    music. I had a free hand really. I had, at one time, a well known composer with
                    an Academy Award and a former student of Nadia Boulanger, named Gail Kubik. He
                    was driving through Morocco and offered his services. He had a short film
                    showing some of the work he had done, and how you add music to a soundtrack of
                    purely staged film to lend atmosphere to it. We set him up at the University and
                    they just sat there and loved it. Here was this big man from Hollywood who had
                    come to speak to them. But I found out later that this kind of initiative was
                    not appreciated in Washington, since I was supposed to concentrate on the
                    “opinion makers” and not the students. But this was accomplished without
                    interfering with my regular programs, and I consider students to be the people
                    you want to aim at as future opinion makers. But that is another subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about Morocco. What was the state
                        oAmerican-Moroccan relations at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Excellent, excellent. The King had survived twassassination attempts you
                    know. One...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One at a birthday party and one...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: ...the airplane outside of Rabat, that's right. And Oufkir, his closest
                    military advisor, was the man behind it, and Oufkir was of course executed. His
                    family was imprisoned in very, very painful conditions, and they came out
                    finally. But it was a long, long haul there, just as Mehdi Ben Barka's family
                    came out only recently after the death of King Hassan. His son, as a measure of
                    clemency, brought the family out; they too had been cooped up in very small
                    cells. Otherwise the King was very well disposed to us. He talked about
                    democracy. Of course, we knew it was not true democracy, but he did what his
                    father, Mohamed V, had not been able to do. He did away with the anarchy of the
                    party system there— the Istiqlal and the UNFP, Ben Barka's party. I've forgotten
                    the details of it. So that he was really running things after a while.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Back in the days when I was an intelligence analyst, we gave him six months
                    because he was a playboy and was not getting along with the political leaders.
                    Well, he knew what to do. He put on his white Djellaba, and he mounted his white
                    horse and rode out into the crowd. They dropped to their knees to revere him
                    because he had “baraka” (the blessing, or just plain luck). They had had nothing
                    but autocratic rule; thus, they counted on his beneficence. Besides, as a
                    cherifien (a descendant of the Prophet) he incarnated legitimacy. I hope his son
                    will carry on in his footsteps. The new king was given tough training by his
                    father, but he has had a softer life than his father because Hassan and Mohamed
                    V had been exiled to Madagascar during the independence struggles in the
                    1950s.</p>
                <p>So I very much enjoyed the stay in Morocco, even though it turned sour toward the
                    end, and this I'll have to allude to only in a general way. A surprise
                    inspection was coming up, and this put the Public Affairs Officer, whose name I
                    will not give you, in a bit of a bind, because he had already sent a thick
                    document with colored tabs that looked very, very professional in which he
                    recommended (without consulting me) that upon my departure, they close up
                    Casablanca and move the operation back to Rabat in a revamped USIS operation out
                    of the basement of the embassy. As I read this thing my jaw dropped. He was
                    saying, “We've got a bad landlord here. He's not doing things. He's cheating us,
                    and so on.” I got back to him and said, “I wish you had told me about this and
                    said openly to me 'I'm thinking of closing down Casablanca.' Then, I would have
                    had to work with you to justify it, if necessary. But you didn't and I can see
                    mistake after mistake in your proposal. You are saying that our landlord is not
                    trustworthy. You are confusing him with the landlord of the American Language
                    Center, a different landlord entirely.” This didn't endear me to him. I'm sure
                    he didn't take kindly to this because he had the habit of bad-mouthing my
                    colleagues in Morocco to me, which is something a supervisor doesn't do.</p>
                <p>So sure enough, when I heard the inspection was coming up, I said, “Well, I just
                    can't go along with this, since I had no part in it,” and if the inspectors ask
                    me what I honestly think, I'm going to have to say I don't approve of it. You've
                    got to have the man living in Casablanca. He can't come here with a briefcase
                    every day to see his contacts. He has got to live here among the people day and
                    night and witness what is happening. I said this in the farewell staff meeting
                    with the Ambassador in Rabat, I'm sure that this did me no good in my career.
                    But I did what I had to do, since an inspector asks you for your true feelings
                    on any subject. Furthermore, my staff must have learned of it because it soured
                    the atmosphere at the Center, and they began looking for other jobs. Well, the
                    inspectors agreed with me. The office is still open in Casablanca. I haven't
                    been back there in 20 years, but I'm proud of it and some day I would like to go
                    back and see how it is doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In my next assignment, I was to be Country Public Affairs Officer in Madagascar
                    at Antananarivo. You chose one post from each geographical area, and I chose
                    Madagascar because it is at a high elevation and, at least, it shouldn't be too
                    unpleasant a place to live in. But once I got there, I found there was not much
                    going on. It was an unfriendly regime. They had North Koreans flying their MIGs
                    over the city almost every day. But the people were friendly and very good
                    people, all the ones I knew had been converted to Christianity either by the
                    fathers on the coast—the black tribes on the coast were converted by the French
                    fathers - or by the London Missionary Society on the high plateau - the people
                    on the high plateau of Indonesian origin were converted by a mix of Norwegian
                    and Americans. We had American Baptists, too. As I understood it, only the
                    Mormons were looked upon unfavorably by the other sects of Christians, for they
                    came to proselytize instead of evangelize.</p>
                <p>I had the impressions that my generation had received in the 1930s and 1940s from
                    literature, as in Somerset Maugham's “Rain,” about sexually repressed
                    missionaries and so on, so I looked askance at the work of the missionaries
                    until I went down to Fort Dauphin, at the southern tip of the island and beyond
                    the Tropic of Capricorn to Manambaro, where the Lutherans had built a hospital
                    which looked like a one-story World War II barracks on wooden pylons. They used
                    volunteers, people mostly from the Northwest, Minnesota or westward,
                    Scandinavian or German in origin. These people were very fervent Christians who
                    would take a year or two off from their practices or jobs and come out to work
                    at this hospital or do whatever else was needed.</p>
                <p>There was one man who owned a garage in Nebraska and came out to see what could
                    be done about a generator which had been given to the hospital by a rich lady.
                    It was a generator for an enormous operation and it used much more fuel than
                    they could possibly afford to burn for their small operation. So, they found
                    this garage owner, and he was able to reduce it to a small putt-putt generator,
                    which was exactly what they needed. It was a great service. There was a doctor I
                    met who said he loved it because his practice at home restricted him to only
                    certain operations. Whereas here, he removed a woman's spleen in the morning and
                    operated on somebody's skull in the afternoon and did a variety of other
                    operations almost every day.</p>
                <p>They didn't have to feed the families. The families would camp under the
                    building, in the shade, and feed their own sick member, while he was in the
                    hospital. And they cured people. When I arrived they had reduced the French
                    presence drastically, and the French-staffed hospitals were closing down. We had
                    a case in which one of our trucks was sideswiped on the highway by a big
                    Malagasy truck, and the young economics officer was killed while the defense
                    attach�'s hip was broken. I saw him years afterwards and he had a shoe with a
                    brace on it, since one leg was several inches shorter than the other. He was
                    still on active duty at DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency). They didn't have the
                    means. It was no longer the modern hospital it had been before. So, he was
                    evacuated by air as soon as possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>We were told to be very careful about getting an assignment in Madagascar,
                    because if you have a heart attack or a burst appendix, you won't be able to get
                    to Nairobi in time. They would do the best they could for you, but that's all.
                    That's what living in Madagascar was like in Antananarivo. My wife and I lived
                    in a beautiful house with no children. We had a cook, a gardener, and a swimming
                    pool which didn't function. We also had a maid, who did housework, and this was
                    more than we needed. My wife had her piano and a temporary job as the charg�'s
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the government like?</p>
                <p>MASON: The Ratsiraka government was Marxist. I was told of a gift from the
                    Soviets to the government in the form of a serum for polio, I think it was. Now,
                    polio serum has to be kept cool. The government was quiet about this because
                    they were keeping it only for their own party members, not for the general
                    public. You would see kids downtown with sticks for legs, dragging themselves
                    around in the street. But that didn't count for the ruling party. They took the
                    serum and put it in the attic of the Presidential Palace, where the temperature
                    must have been almost 100 degrees, so it spoiled all the serum. That's the sort
                    of thing: incompetence, mixed with ideological stupidity. This sort of thing
                    happened only too frequently.</p>
                <p>I should say that in 1972, the pro-French President, Tsiranana, was overthrown
                    and the Hotel de Ville, in downtown Antananarivo, was burnt down leaving only a
                    shell. It was there the whole time that I was there. There was no attempt to
                    rebuild it. Then there had been another coup in the mid-1970s, 1976 I guess it
                    was, which brought Ratsiraka to power. I arrived in 1978, and he was sitting
                    hard on the people. He's back in power now, but I'm told he has seen the light
                    and is welcoming aid from the West. By the way, I'm still in touch with my chief
                    assistant there and have a framed “Certificate of Appreciation and Commendation”
                    signed by the entire staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you able to operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MASON: Not very well. We would have shows. We would have films. The people,
                    again, were a very religious people, very pious. There again I learned
                    something. When Pope John Paul II made his first trip to the United States, I
                    was able as Public Affairs Officer to invite the Cardinal to my house and see
                    the film of the Pope's trip to the United States, which was quite impressive. He
                    was very gracious and benign about it, and we had a nice friendly discussion.
                    But afterwards a group of nuns asked me about the American nuns in the film and
                    repeated what the film had said, that some of them wished they could be priests.
                    Specifically, there was one red-headed nun in Philadelphia, who had to sit in
                    the basement while the priests were sitting in the nave where they could see the
                    Pope. She was outraged at that-perhaps rightly, perhaps wrongly, I don't know. I
                    tried to be truthful about controversial subjects in the States without saying
                    that this was they way things should be in Madagascar. I simply explained that
                    we have a woman's movement in the United States, and women are demanding equal
                    status with men, and it is not for me to say whether this can take place within
                    the Church or not.</p>
                <p>Then on other occasions, I'd invite people to the house for movies, and once we
                    showed San Francisco, with Jeanette MacDonald and Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy.
                    They thought that was wonderful. That was just the kind of movie they loved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great Earthquake.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Great Earthquake, but everything comes out well in the end. They all sing
                    Nearer My God to Thee at the end. But then we had A Streetcar Named Desire, with
                    Vivian Leigh distraught and alcoholic and then being raped by Marlon Brando.
                    Afterward one woman asked me, “Is this really what American women are like” and
                    I said, “Oh, no, no! This is a very, very unusual case. Nothing like this
                    happens in the general population.” Now Streetcar is a great play. I have great
                    respect for it, especially in its sociological aspects, the decline of the
                    Southern aristocracy, and the rise of the immigrant population, represented by
                    Brando/Kowalski. This was a change in the power structure in the United States
                    being documented in human terms, and I think Williams did a beautiful job of it.
                    It's his best play from that point of view. But it was not something I should
                    have shown to an audience which loved San Francisco.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>This takes me back to the early days in Casablanca when we showed A Farewell to
                    Arms with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones, and it was interesting to note that
                    the Moroccan boys were outraged because he deserted. “This man was a deserter!
                    He had a job to do and he didn't do it.” They were taught that you don't desert.
                    “Well, he's not a deserter,” I said, “because the American army wasn't there.
                    This was the Italian army and he was just an ambulance driver.” I guess I got
                    around it that way, but you can see the mind set of various peoples. It depends
                    on where you are and how well you know those peoples. This has been my complaint
                    with the Agency, with over centralization in Washington, with “opinion makers”
                    as we call them. We can be the opinion makers, if we get the kids at the right
                    age and show them what America is really like. But we weren't supposed to go
                    after kids. No, we were supposed to go after the people who were already in
                    power and argue with them and convert them and bring them over to our point of
                    view. This really depends on where you are working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it does.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: And a public affairs officer who gets to know a population as I tried to
                    get to know the Moroccans on the one hand and the Malagasy on the other has to
                    do it a different way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Madagascar, who was your ambassador
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: First I had Bob Barrett, who was the permanent charg� d'affaires. We
                    didn't have an ambassador for the first year. The second year it was Fernando
                    Rondon, a Hispanic who had been ambassador to Ecuador and Honduras. He had had a
                    previous assignment in Madagascar. One of his children was born in Madagascar so
                    he was very welcome there. His French was good and he was a fine man, but he
                    wasn't a close friend. Bob and Mavis Barrett are close friends. Bob didn't get
                    his ambassadorship until after serving as DCM in Beirut, and then he was made
                    ambassador in Djibouti, where he stayed for two tours. I got along beautifully
                    with Bob and admired him as an officer. And with Rondon? We got along well, but
                    I was only with him for a very few months. He had to wait to present his Letters
                    of Accreditation, so of course couldn't participate in public affairs for
                    several weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the government there trying to throw up roadblocks and
                        hurt the relationship or were we generally ignored or how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MASON: As far as I could figure out, we were ignored. The opposition were
                    encouraged to embarrass us. There was an article about what Castro was doing in
                    Cuba, and a USIA film about the Mariel Boat Lift in 1980. When they saw the
                    film, my chief assistants came up to me and said, “Please don't show this film
                    here in Madagascar!” And you could see from some of the faces on that film that
                    this was not the cream of Cuban society. I didn't show the film, but it never
                    should have been sent to me in the first place. Then I let an article go which
                    was critical of Cuba, and the Cuban ambassador complained. Again, I had never
                    been briefed on the so-called third party rule. I should have known, but never
                    even had an orientation with USIA. That's the way they trained people.</p>
                <p>I had gotten my promotion in Casablanca, by the way, through Jim Tull, who said I
                    was the best Center Director he'd had in 20 years in the business because I was
                    able to move my center from the old premises to the new premises, while still
                    continuing to work with no hiatus. “While any other branch Public Affairs
                    Officer would have closed down everything for a period of weeks, if not months,”
                    he went on. Well, I didn't have to close down, and I don't think that was such a
                    great accomplishment. I am surprised that others had had to. Another thing I
                    discovered when I got to Casablanca was that the flag we were still using in
                    1954 in that old cultural center was a 48 star flag, 15 years after Alaska and
                    Hawaii had achieved statehood! So I had to ask the Agency to send us a new
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, back in Madagascar, did things move at all or was
                        thijust an unfriendly regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: It was not entirely unfriendly. The number two man at the Foreign Ministry
                    was Rasafseheno, a fine gentleman. He was just as friendly with us as he could
                    have been, even though his boss I guess was not. He invited me once to the
                    Ministry, greeted me on the steps outside and saw me off the same way.
                    Unfortunately, he was sent to the U.S. as ambassador in the early 1980s and died
                    during a bypass operation at George Washington University HospitaHis wife was
                    there, and it was a sad moment. He was such a nice fellow. He would be admired
                    by any Malagasy. They are a kind and gentle people.</p>
                <p>By the way, it was in Madagascar that I wrote the first draft of mnovel, Hostage
                    to Fortune.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back in what? Was it 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MASON: Yes, 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MASON: By that time, I had known for six months that I would go to Rome as Deputy
                    Cultural Affairs Officer. I had some trepidation about that. I had never been
                    assigned as a Cultural Affairs Officer anywhere, nor had I ever had a Washington
                    tour with USIA. I was still making mistakes about which part of the Agency did
                    what, I had never had the basic orientation that I should have had.
                    Nevertheless, foolishly I considered it a “stretch” assignment, thinking.” I
                    must have done something right to be given a job where my talents can be put to
                    the best use and help me to learn something.” It was more than a disappointment.
                    In Rome, I was expected to jump into the job and perform professionally without
                    a day of on-the-job training. I was given no help, and because of disagreements,
                    I left after nine months and returned to Washington and the television service.
                    Thus began my first Washington tour as part of the television service, which was
                    in the Patrick Henry Building on Seventh Street. This was good training, and
                    being a lifelong writer and having been in the State Department in media
                    services, it was a job I enjoyed. I was assigned to get coverage and VCRs for
                    the desk officers of various countries in the Middle East and Africa. I was
                    ready to retire and might even have retired if I had finished my tour in Rome.
                    But this was better.</p>
                <p>In Washington, we moved into an apartment at Columbia Plaza, where we still live,
                    20 years later. After two and a half years at that job, I reached exactly 30
                    years of service, from the first of March 1955 to the first of March 1985. I
                    told them I planned to retire. A year later, reaching age 60, my army reserve
                    retirement came into force, and I got all the privileges of a lieutenant colonel
                    who had had a career in the army. So since then, call me a double dipper if you
                    want, I have both. As a civilian I worked in factories and other jobs, enough to
                    have earned minimum Social Security. My wife also had worked as an ambassador's
                    assistant or secretary, filling-in in Madagascar. She had also worked at TWA in
                    Paris as a French employee before marrying me, as well as jobs in Saigon and in
                    Germany, which meant that because of an agreement between France and the United
                    States, wives and others who have some social security time coming to them in
                    the United States and in France, or some other country, can combine those to get
                    a full or at least the minimum pension level. She was able to do that in both
                    countries. She had enough time, by combining them, so that she had more than she
                    needed in one country and as much as she needed in the other.</p>
                <p>So we have made out very well, and I have returned to my writing. As you know, I
                    have written a novel about the Foreign Service, Hostage to Fortune, which draws
                    on a lot of things that I knew but refers to no individual I've known. I say
                    this sincerely. It is not just a remark. I am not getting back at anybody that I
                    didn't like, but I am trying to bring out the aspects that I most appreciate
                    about the Foreign Service and to show the consequences of breaking certain
                    rules, whether to the guilty person or to an innocent person, even putting lives
                    in danger. And by the way, I'm signing copies at military PXs (Post Exchanges)
                    in the Washington area, and it is doing very well. It is now in a second edition
                    and has sold over 850 copies, this time with “blurbs” from several senior
                    Foreign Service officers, including John Waller and Barrett McGurn, both of them
                    authors in their own right.</p>

                <p>Q: Once back on the television service, did you find that you were able to bring
                    sort of a sense of the field to the television service, in other words, to be
                    aware of things that probably would not play too well overseas?</p>
                <p>MASON: Not really. I was merely the liaison officer between the Middle East and
                    African desk officers and the TV Service. It was the desk which ordered the
                    product it wanted for that country, and I was there to facilitate the
                    production. Of course, it was strictly the American view on everything, whether
                    you were dealing with the Grenada invasion or Panama or whatever. We were just
                    putting out the word as it came out of Washington. What emerged was Worldnet, a
                    television hook-up for questions and answers visually between the Secretary of
                    State or other high official and the press corps in a given country, so that the
                    journalists there could see them answering their question. It is an excellent
                    idea as far as it goes, although I had nothing to do with the conception of the
                    idea.</p>

                <p>MASON: In summary, I am satisfied with a career which did not meet all my
                    expectations. I gave it my best, and I learned which were my strong points and
                    which were my weak ones. We've been active in retirement here. I sat on
                    promotion panels in the early years and have volunteered at the State Department
                    Book Room and at the Book Fair for over 15 years. I am a lifelong lover of
                    classical music, and my wife is a pianist, a member of several musical
                    organizations here, and endows an annual concert at the Phillips Collection in
                    perpetuity. We are volunteers at the Washington Opera. We've funded scholarships
                    in my dad's name both at Taft School and at Yale, and I've given talks in local
                    libraries on embassy security and the Foreign Service in general in an effort to
                    sell my book. We also visit Europe twice a year on military aircraft as
                    retirees. And by the way, I am readying a collection of my best stories for
                    publication, I hope, in 2004.</p>
                <p>So we're proud to have served, and we hope to go on doing so as lonas we can.</p>
