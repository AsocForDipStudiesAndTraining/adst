                <p>Q: Today is the June 19, 2001. This is an interview with Lewis M. White,
                    W-H-I-T-E, who is known as Jack. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy and this is being
                    done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies. Jack, let's sort of
                    start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and where you were born and
                    something about your family?</p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, I was born August 22, 1921, in Chase City, Virginia, where my father
                    was opening up a Coca Cola bottling plant. But my father was really from Bedford
                    County, Virginia, where they were settled before 1800.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where's Bedford County?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Bedford County is 200 miles south of Washington, and it has a certain
                    notoriety because on June 6 they dedicated the national D-Day memorial there;
                    President Bush went down to address the 15,000 people who came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's where so many people from the 29th Division
                        came.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's right. They had over 35 people from Bedford—thNational Guard
                    unit—23 died on that day.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk first about your father, then your mother. What's the background of
                    your father's family?</p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, if we went back to the original background, to the early history of
                    Virginia, they practically all were farmers; they were landowners. And when they
                    came, on both my mother and father's side, to central Virginia, Amherst County
                    and Bedford County, in the 1700s, they still owned farms. Eventually they got
                    into business; my father was in business, and they went into the professions, of
                    various kinds, as the farms got smaller. So, in my generation they were all
                    educated in the college.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your father, where did he go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: He didn't go to college. He was in rural Virginia, where even the local
                    school was just a log school at that time, so he did it on his own. He read a
                    great deal, and so he was more or less self-educated. My mother was raised seven
                    miles away, she got a better preparation, living with relatives in Newport News,
                    and she did go to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's take your father first. Your father's business
                        yosay was with the Coca- Cola bottling plant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, after four years in Chase City, where he opened up a Coca Cola
                    bottling plant and managed it successfully with a profit every year. Then he got
                    a job as manager of a chain of Coca-Cola bottling plants in Michigan and we
                    moved to Grand Rapids. So we lived there for about five years, until I was eight
                    years old, and then he moved back to Virginia, where he always planned to go
                    back when he had enough money. He settled on the family farm, in the family
                    since 1819, and built his dream house, a large brick home. It is across the road
                    from the brick home of my great-great-great grandfather, which in his time was
                    the manor house of a plantation of about 1,300 acres. The village here is called
                    Cifax, Virginia. It was originally called Sycamore, but there were so many
                    Sycamores that the Post Office asked the postmaster to select another name. He
                    had a horse named Cifax and that is how the village got its name. And Cifax,
                    Virginia is now on the landmark register, both local and national. On the
                    Virginia Landmark Register it is called the Cifax Rural Historic District. The
                    original manor house was called The Cedars and the one built by my father was
                    called Glen Alpine. Both of these houses passed out of the family when my father
                    died in 1962 and my mother moved to Richmond. When the Worshams bought The
                    Cedars in the early eighties, Mrs. Worsham and I collaborated on a book on the
                    neighborhood entitled The Cedars of Cifax: A Virginia Rural Historic District. I
                    contributed many of the photos for the book. The place is a very beautiful part
                    of Virginia, within sight of the Peaks of Otter in the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother and her background and her
                        upbringing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, she lived on a farm, about 900 acres, seven miles from where my
                    father was raised. He was raised at The Cedars. My mother was a Rucker. The
                    original Rucker came to Virginia in 1700 and the family has proliferated. From
                    1990 to 2,000 I was treasurer of the Rucker Family Society and we had around 750
                    members and was still growing. We have reunions every two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your mother, her family was of basically the same
                        stock,coming from, having_?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WHITE: That's right. Since both the Ruckers and the Whites came to Bedford County
                    before 1800 and married into families which were also early arrivals, we always
                    had a lot of people around who were kin. On my father's side we have a book
                    called Our Kin, which has over 800 pages, and includes most of the old families
                    of Bedford County, and we have another one on my mother's side The Rucker
                    Genealogy, which includes all the Ruckers, so we know that we're related to many
                    of the old families, in that region. The tradition is that the Ruckers were
                    French Huguenots even though the name is Germanic, but they married into
                    families with English names. Both of these books were first published in the
                    early 1930s but they have been reprinted several times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your mother go to college_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: She went to Farmville, which was a teachers college at thatime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She went to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It is now called Longwood College and is located in Farmville, Virginia,
                    about 40 miles east of Lynchburg. She took teacher training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Teacher training. But her parents were basically
                        farming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They were. But none of the descendants were. They went intsomething
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, how did your mother and father meet? I mean,
                        themust have met when they were kids.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They did. My father was about eight years older, and for a long time she
                    was just one of the younger girls: he was more interested in her older sister.
                    My mother had three sisters and four brothers. All of the girls were very
                    attractive and popular. Eventually Dad saw that Mother was developing into a
                    very pretty and vivacious girl, so he took an interest in her. They started
                    dating and soon they were married when Mother was 20. It was a good marriage and
                    we had a happy home. I was the oldest and had two brothers and three</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you recall, before you went to Grand Rapids
                        anythinabout_? You grew up in a small town, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yes. Chase City had maybe 2000 people. Several of the people from Cifax
                    were in the Coca Cola bottling business when it was getting started. They had
                    the contacts. The Thomson family, one of our kin, owned the general store in
                    Cifax. Henry Thomson married Lula Lupton and the Luptons were among the pioneers
                    in franchises for Coca Cola bottling plants. A number of the Thomsons and
                    Luptons became wealthy in this business. One of the Thomson boys was a
                    contemporary of my father in Cifax and he built one of the most beautiful
                    estates in Virginia on the road between Cifax and Lynchburg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about as a kid? Did you go to elementary schools in
                        Virginibefore you went to Grand Rapids?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I went to kindergarten and the first grade in Grand Rapids, and then
                    we came back and I entered the local school, which had seven grades. It had two
                    rooms, one teacher would teach the first, second and third grades, and another
                    teacher would teach the next four grades. We used to walk to school on dirt
                    roads at that time, and I can't say that we got the best education in the world
                    in that rural climate. But that's the kind of schools they had, and before us
                    they were even worse than that. Now they're centralized and it's quite
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back from Grand Rapids when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: 1929.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, and then in high school you were in
                        Virginia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was the youngest one; I was a lot smaller than anybody elsin my class. I
                    had skipped the third grade.</p>
                <p>Q: The runt of the litter. Well now, you came back and started schooling just at
                    the time when a certain thing started, and that was the Great Depression. How
                    did that affect you all?</p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, actually, it was a little tough in the beginning, but my father was
                    a partner in the Coca Cola bottling plant in Decatur, Illinois, so that began to
                    produce a good income, enough so that - he had six children in his family, and
                    he educated all of them in college. He sent the two youngest ones to prep
                    schools instead of the local high school. And he built a nice big home, so it
                    was the earnings from his investment that really paid off. Eventually as
                    finances improved my parents joined the country club in Lynchburg, they were
                    socially accepted everywhere, and had many friends, both in the rural areas and
                    in the surrounding cities. But my father ran the old family farm, too, because
                    he really liked doing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Q: Tell me, do you recall anything about the elementary school, anything that you
                    were particularly interested in, studies or activities?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I think I was especially interested in geography and history. And my
                    father subscribed to so many magazines, The National Geographic included. It
                    seems that he subscribed to almost every magazine there was. He also subscribed
                    to a book club, The Literary Guild. I started reading them at a very early age.
                    So we kept up with what was going on in the world.</p>
                <p>Q: How about, yes, you recall the War Between the States, was that a major
                    subject, both in school and discussion, coming from where you were in
                    Virginia?</p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I don't think so, I think actually people were pretty reconciled to
                    the situation, and that being Americans, nobody wanted a separate Confederate
                    state, nobody wanted slavery. I think the situation had been accepted, and
                    probably among the most patriotic parts of the country was the South. My father
                    used to say he was tired of hearing about the civil war and a number of his best
                    friends were northerners who had moved into the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about black-white relations at the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think we actually loved the blacks that we knew, and we were very fond
                    of them because there was a certain loyalty - they felt loyalty toward us and we
                    felt affection for them. And we still look back with a lot of love and respect
                    on all the blacks we knew around home, and there were a lot of blacks around
                    home. We wrote about them in our book on Cifax.</p>
                <p>My ancestors on every side were in the Confederacy. My great grandfather, John
                    Milton White, fought all the way through and was finally captured in one of the
                    last battles. He was a lieutenant. Before that both the Whites and the Ruckers
                    were in the Revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where'd you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had a consolidated high school at that time called New London Academy,
                    which was really the oldest chartered secondary school in Virginia. Thomas
                    Jefferson had his place Poplar Forest close by and he knew the school. His
                    nephew went there. It was private for a long time and then finally they made it
                    public. It wasn't comparable in my time to the better city schools, but we
                    managed to learn something there and there was a good group of people there. I
                    always thought they were wonderful people, the people I knew in Bedford County.
                    They were my schoolmates. I still go down almost every year to the high school

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of the teachers there particularly remarkable
                        from youpoint of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think they were dedicated teachers, and if you wanted to learn, you
                    would learn. I think I would pretty much leave it at that. They did their job,
                    and I think I learned Latin, French, whatever they had to teach. If there were
                    any failings, it was no doubt my own fault. For example, I was elected as
                    president of the senior class, but out of some perversity I refused to accept
                    it.</p>

                        iyour learning about the world or about life or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I don't recall that the school I went to at Cifax had any library at all,
                    and the New London Academy didn't have a very big library - but where I learned
                    was from the Literary Guild that my father subscribed to and all the magazines;
                    he took, quite a few, and we had a neighbor, a cousin, who went to Harvard and
                    Washington Lee and had a big library of boys' books from a previous era. He
                    loaned us books all the time. We read all those books - Tom Swift and his
                    inventions, a series on the adventures of the Boy Scouts around the turn of the
                    century. My father subscribed to three boys' magazines for us: The American Boy,
                    The Open Road for Boys, and Boys' Life.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I did take drawing, I liked art. And I liked history. I liked
                    French, I liked Latin. I didn't like math very well at the time, but later on
                    when I was studying math on my own I developed a fondness for math. But at the
                    time I wasn't too fond of math.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school about 1939 or so_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: '38.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right, you skipped a grade. What about events in
                        Europe,were these of any concern within your family, to you or to the

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think at the time people were more concerned about the Depression. And
                    we thought the British and the French were powerful countries and they could
                    probably deal with the situation without us. And I think the general tendency at
                    that time was probably more isolationist. We had to have Pearl Harbor to get
                    everybody patriotically involved and behind the war effort.</p>

                        Roosevelt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: My father and his closest friends who were businessmen were not much in
                    favor of the New Deal. But I myself thought, reading about the New Deal, that it
                    was the best way to deal with the problem at hand. The CCC camps and a lot of
                    programs like that were very good for the country. And I probably didn't think
                    too much about capitalism and communism at the time. But looking back, it seems
                    that FDR saved capitalism. We subscribed to Time magazine from its beginning and
                    I always read it from cover to cover. We also subscribed to Life and Look.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One does get that impression, looking back. So you
                        graduated i1938. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: My parents thought that since I'd come from a rural school and was rather
                    small, that I should go to a small college first. They had met the treasurer
                    from Hampden- Sydney College, which was about 50 miles from home - a small
                    liberal arts school with about 400 students. It had an excellent reputation with
                    a high number of graduates in Who's Who, the highest per capita in the U.S. So
                    they thought it would be good for me to go and spend two years at Hampden-Sydney
                    and maybe from then go on to something bigger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find Hampton Sydney at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I thought that Hampton Sydney at that time was a place where I met a lot
                    of boys who became good friends. I joined a fraternity. They had a certain
                    amount of hazing of freshman, but I could take it. They had some excellent
                    teachers, but if I compare the teaching there with what I got at Georgetown, I
                    would say it wasn't quite as much what I was interested in. I did extremely well
                    at Greek but algebra was a disaster. This was my own fault because later on my
                    own I developed a fondness for math and had no difficulty in solving the
                    problems. And when I switched from the assistant football coach who was trying
                    to teach math to the regular teacher I did well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, after two years through '41 - you went where,
                        tGeorgetown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, I had a fraternity brother who had the catalogs of Georgetown
                    University School of Foreign Service. He had examples of the old Foreign Service
                    exam, and looking over the exam I thought, “Well, if I can learn enough to pass
                    these exams, I'll have the kind of education I want.” I thought I could pass it;
                    so I persuaded my father that if he would send me to Georgetown University
                    School of Foreign Service that I would be better equipped than I would be by
                    just getting a liberal arts education.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>And at that time there was a lot of business administration in the Foreign
                    Service School, and since he was business oriented, I think that he was
                    impressed that I would be studying commercial law and accounting and all of
                    that. And he always wanted to learn a foreign language himself, so I persuaded
                    him, and he agreed to send me to Georgetown University, which I liked very much.
                    I will always appreciate my father permitting me to go to Georgetown. It changed
                    my life. I know he would have loved having an education like that himself, but
                    since he didn't get the opportunity, he did his best to see that his children
                    did get an education. I owe a lot to my parents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from “41 to_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was there from '41 to '43, and then my Draft Board called me up. I was
                    ready to start my senior year and wanted to know if I would be able to finish it
                    before being called up. They said that if I joined the “enlisted reserve,”
                    they'd probably permit me to finish the senior year. I tried to get into the
                    enlisted reserve, and they said, “You're underweight and one of your eyes is
                    bad, so we can't accept you.” So I signed up for my senior year at Georgetown,
                    but after about a month the Draft Board called me up. I passed with flying
                    colors the exam to get into the army, and I was glad that I was accepted, since
                    I really wanted to serve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to Georgetown first, Father Walsh was the
                        head othe School of Foreign Service._?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the School of Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I found it excellent. First when I went into the second year Spanish
                    class, the members of the class were speaking Spanish and I didn't speak Spanish
                    because they didn't teach it at Hampton Sydney: they taught Spanish at
                    Hampden-Sydney, but they didn't teach you to speak it. We had a Mexican at
                    Georgetown and he was teaching you how to speak it. So I had to go to some
                    Spanish school and get some tutoring before I could pursue Spanish at
                    Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a private organization, S-A-N-Z is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, Sanz Spanish School. I went there for a while and learned enough to
                    get back into the Spanish class. Father Walsh was teaching geopolitics and he
                    was a wonderful teacher. After I was drafted, my father was having trouble
                    getting a refund because I'd only been there a month. But I wrote to Father
                    Walsh and he sent me a very nice letter, and I got a refund right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it from your background that you probably came from
                        what,a Protestant background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, yes it was. They were Episcopalians up until the Revolution, and then
                    they usually became either Methodists or Baptists, and now a lot of them have
                    back to being Episcopalians. After I left home my folks joined the Episcopalian
                    Church in Bedford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the School of Foreign Service very Catholic,
                        Jesuit,or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I probably didn't know what to make of all the priests on the campus and
                    what their role was. I didn't know whether to call theBrother or Father. But
                    eventually I began to feel very much at home and got to know the students. I had
                    some Catholic roommates, I developed a fondness for the Catholics, and
                    especially those of Irish descent. I appreciated the ethnic diversity of the
                    U.S. And I still go back to Georgetown every time I get a chance, and I
                    contribute $100 annually to their fund.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened when the military, you got drafted in
                        1943?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was in October 1942. I was drafted and I was sent to Camp Gruber,
                    Oklahoma and an Ordinance Company. Actually, they called me “limited service,”
                    because I can't read out of my left eye, even though I can see everything
                    perfectly well and at that time didn't even need glasses. We had an Indian squad
                    leader and he recommended me for promotion to Private First Class.</p>
                <p>After a while they wanted to form another company, so they made me a Tech
                    Sergeant, that's one with the five stripes. So I went out to help train the next
                    company. We trained at Camp Polk, Louisiana, and received regular infantry
                    training. After about a year of training we were ready to go overseas. They
                    said, “Well, you're 'limited service' and we're going overseas, and if you want
                    to go overseas, you'll have to volunteer for it.” So, of course, I volunteered.
                    We crossed the Atlantic in a Liberty ship in December 1943; we spent a month in
                    Algeria. That was fascinating—the first foreign country I had ever visited.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WHITE: The 173rd Ordnance Base Depot Company. We still have our reunions, every
                    year. I organized one here, two years ago in Washington, and many came. I had a
                    bus take them around Washington, Alexandria, and Baltimore. So I'm still loyal
                    to the old boys. I'll go again to one in August out in Spokane, Washington. Most
                    of the men in our unit came from the West Coast.</p>
                <p>In January we boarded a former Dutch passenger ship for an unknown destination.
                    The Germans were still in Italy so they could bomb us. I have learned only
                    recently that we were originally destined for Italy, but the Germans sunk a
                    troop transport in the Mediterranean on Nov. 26, 1943 and over a thousand U. S.
                    soldiers perished. Included was an ordnance company headed for India. So we were
                    diverted to India. We arrived iBombay, got on a train, went to Calcutta, and
                    then on a riverboat up the Brahmaputra River to Assam in northeastern India
                    where there are a lot of tea growing plantations.</p>
                <p>We had a camp there, using a former tea warehouse, and we supplied ordnance for
                    the Chinese. We shipped everything over the Himalayas, the “Hump.” We didn't
                    have a road through Burma to China at the time. We shared a camp with Merrill's
                    Marauders - they had one side and we had the other with a field in between. They
                    had a cement slab in the field where they used to cremate the Ghurka
                    soldiers.</p>
                <p>After a year of supplying the Chinese from Assam, a new company was formed in
                    Kunming, China to operate an ordnance depot at that end. We were mainly handling
                    automotive parts. I was chosen to go to Kunming, China, and spent a year there.
                    So we flew over the Hump, and we were in Kunming when they finished building the
                    Ledo Road through Burma.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: There was more contact with the British. The Indians were agitating for
                    independence and we wanted to concentrate on winning the war. We had an instance
                    in our company in which a number of our men got court-martialed because they saw
                    a case of Belgian pistols and thought they were authorized to take some as
                    souvenirs. One of them sold a Belgian pistol to an Indian and the British found
                    out about it. Fortunately, I didn't know about those pistols and wouldn't have
                    wanted one if I had known.</p>

                <p>WHITE: No, there weren't. But we were occasionally invited to rest camps where we
                    mingled with the British. I spent a few days at one rest camp. We had very
                    friendly relations with the British. We thought it was kind of peculiar the way
                    they played ball, kicking the soccer ball around. We went out with one British
                    soldier and we paid for everything. I think he was embarrassed because we caught
                    him without any money. Because later he invited us out and he couldn't do enough
                    for us.</p>

                    they captured the town of Myitkyina it was possible to complete the Ledo road.
                    We used to hear them over there shooting off their guns, and celebrating because
                    they were coming back out of the jungle. We lost a plane of ordnance people
                    going over the Hump, too. They had to come back through the Burmese jungle after
                    the plane crashed. I had no fear flying over the Hump, but I have read that many
                    planes were lost on that route.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: At the timGovernor Yung Lung—I believe that was his name— was a warlord in
                    control of the province. He was supposed to be pro-Nationalist, but Chiang
                    Kai-shek didn't trust him. So when the end of the war came and he needed
                    somebody to go down and disarm the Japanese in Vietnam - French Indochina they
                    called it - he sent Governor Yung Lung down and the next day we saw that
                    Nationalist soldiers had moved into Kunming to take over. Chiang Kai-shek was
                    consolidating his hold on Yunan province.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the Chinese while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had a lot of contact. More contact than we had with the Indians. I even
                    made a good friend there, Donald Young, who looked me up in New York after the
                    war. They would entertain us and we would entertain them. The Chinese girls were
                    attractive, but I never did date a Chinese girl. I was shy at the time. Some of
                    the guys did get dates with the Chinese girls and we always had some at our
                    company parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the Chinese launched their big
                        offensive tpick up the airfields and all that? Or did that happen
                        before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: What was the question?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there had been a big Japanese offensive against the airfields, I think
                    we put B- 29s in, and I was wondering - Kunming was pretty far away, I
                    guess?</p>
                <p>WHITE: We used to get attacks from the Japanese trying to bomb the airfield. The
                    first time they came over, we hid among the Chinese graves, which were built
                    above the ground. Then we built some trenches and we would go there and hide.
                    But they were very ineffective in Kunming. And I don't think they were effective
                    any place in the western part of China, because we clobbered them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Chinese military that you

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think Stilwell didn't trust Chiang Kai-shek, but he probably worked well
                    with the Chinese people who were in his command. The Chinese did keep the
                    Japanese from going beyond a certain point—but I don't think we thought that
                    they were very well trained or equipped troops. There was a problem with
                    training. We were trying to train them and equip them. Maybe the people that
                    actually had contact with the soldiers would have a different opinion. I don't
                    know, but the Chinese we dealt with, we had a pretty good opinion of them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, yes, I still thought that I would like to go into the Foreign
                    Service; I even started studying Mandarin there when I had a teacher in Kunming,
                    but we moved our camp and I lost the teacher; so I had to stop studying
                    Mandarin. I saw the U.S. Consulate building there in Kunming, I didn't know at
                    the time that I would eventually know in DACOR (Diplomatic and Consular Officers
                    Retired), the man who was there as consul.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Wellborn, Alfred Wellborn. I saw him recently at the DACOR Memorial Day
                    ceremony. I had always thought that I would take the Foreign Service exam at
                    some point. But I was anxious to spend some time in the States, date some
                    American girls, and finish my education at Georgetown before applying to take
                    the exam.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come back and finish at Georgetown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I did, in about six months. I came back in January, and bthat summer I'd
                    already finished it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That was in '46.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you taken the Foreign Service exam at all at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No. I took the Foreign Service exam one time in New York in 1949, but I
                    got - I think you had to have 70 - and I got 68. So I decided I would take it
                    again. And when I was in Paris - I went to Paris in 1950 - I studied French at
                    the Alliance Fran�aise and started at the Sorbonne. I took the exam at the
                    Embassy in Paris. And unfortunately when I was taking the languages exam, I got
                    sick. I think the tension was so great, that I asked to be excused and I went
                    outside where they could keep an eye on me. But I couldn't finish the exam, so I
                    didn't pass the language exam. They said, “If you pass the rest of it you can
                    take the language exam again.” So I passed the rest of it, and then when I went
                    back to Washington, I took both French and Spanish, and I passed both of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, you say 1950. What happened between 1946 and
                        '50?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WHITE: I had a class in exporting at Georgetown and the teacher was with the
                    Department of Commerce. He said there were some jobs in the regional offices; if
                    we had good enough grades, we could qualify. So I got a job with the New York
                    office of the Department of Commerce as a commercial agent. They were
                    overwhelmed with trade complaints coming in from abroad against American
                    exporters. The wanted me to work on this backlog of complaints. So I would get a
                    batch of complaints against firms in a given area and every day I'd go around to
                    visit these firms and see if I could settle the complaints. It wasn't an easy
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do that for almost three or four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was there doing that work until I went to Paris in 1950. It was a great
                    experience living in New York at that time and I enjoyed it tremendously. My
                    roommate was my brother's roommate at Virginia Military Institute and he knew my
                    family well. We had a large circle of friends and we entertained a lot. He had
                    been a Air Force officer in Europe during the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Foreign Service still have a certain amount of
                        prioritfor you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, yes it did. I used to see the FSOs coming through the New York
                    office. I'd talk to them; in fact, later I met some of them that I now know very
                    well that I remember when they came through for briefing. I was always thinking
                    I might try taking the exam and see if I had a chance of passing it. We had an
                    FSO who was assigned to the New York office. I used to talk to him and he
                    encouraged me to take the exam. But I still rather enjoyed living in New York. I
                    enjoyed being back with my family, being with Americans again. But it was
                    intriguing, the whole idea of serving the United States abroad. I always thought
                    of the United States as being on the right side of history. I thought we had a
                    lot to contribute, and I wanted to be a part of it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I didn't marry until I got to my first post in Bogot�, Colombia. I
                    dated a lot and I considered getting married once or twice, but I never was
                    really in love until I met my wife and we have been married for 48 years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: '51, the spring of '51.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall anything, any of the questions or_?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well, yes, I do recall many of them. Actually, there were four of us who
                    went in there, and I was probably one of the least impressive looking of the
                    bunch. As I recall the examiners were Ambassador Dreyfuss, returning from
                    Afghanistan. Mr. Merrill - I think he was the head of the Economic Commission
                    for Europe at one time. There was a Mr. Brown who was the retired head of the
                    civil service. There was a gentleman, a Mr. Moser, I believe, who had been head
                    of the Far East Division of the Department of Commerce. There was also a
                    representative of the private sector, a gentleman from Westinghouse.</p>
                <p>They wanted to know about China, they wanted to know about India. They wanted to
                    know what books I was reading and what newspapers I was reading. They had part
                    of the exam in French; I was able to at least communicate with Ambassador
                    Dreyfuss in French.</p>
                <p>They wanted to know my interest in art. In fact, we had a discussion where they
                    eventually decided I was right and they were wrong. Just where the impressionist
                    art was in Paris, not in the Louvre but over in the Jeu de Paume. There was no
                    question they asked me that I didn't answer correctly, except one about what
                    kind of plant was established in Hopewell, Virginia after World War I. But they
                    did ask me a difficult one: “Why did you have difficulty with algebra at Hampden
                    Sydney?” “Do you think you could get out the post's books?” I said, “I took two
                    years of accounting at Georgetown and I did very well.” And, actually, the only
                    reason I did poorly on algebra at Hampden Sydney was because my teacher was the
                    assistant football coach, the class of the main teacher being too full. Since
                    then I have studied algebra on my own, and what seemed hard then seems easy now.
                    And when I had trigonometry under the main math teacher I did well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you told at the time you had passed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes. They called the two of us who had passed in and told us we had
                    passed. The other one now serves with me on the Musical Committee of DACOR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who's this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Franklin Crawford. We had lunch together after being informed that we had
                    passed and we compared notes. Oh, yes, another thing they asked me about was my
                    drinking habits. I'm practically a teetotaler, but my friends - my brother's
                    roommate at Virginia Military Institute for one, drank quite a bit and my best
                    friend up there who went to Paris with me - he was a lieutenant j.g. (junior
                    grade) in the Navy during the war - was a hard drinker. So probably my group of
                    friends had a reputation of hard drinking, but for my own part, I hardly ever
                    took a drink that I would finish. Franklin Crawford said they asked him the same
                    thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I told them that if I were offered a drink, I would take it; I wasn't a
                    teetotaler.. I would take it, but I didn't drink very much. Just whatever they
                    had to offer, I'd take it. I still don't drink very much, just a little wine
                    with a meal, a little beer if there is something that goes with beer, pork for
                    instance.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm just trying to recreate the times. I think there was a concern at times
                    that they might end up with teetotalers, in particular people who might be
                    rather vehement teetotalers, which, given the Foreign Service, if you were
                    abroad and you didn't serve wine and drinks this could be a detriment.</p>
                <p>WHITE: I think I gave the right answer; if the hosts serve alcohol I'll drink it,
                    but not too much of it. And then they wanted to know about my girlfriends. I had
                    lots of girlfriends, but they were interested at that time in homosexuality;
                    they wanted to see a picture of the girl I was more or less engaged to.
                    Fortunately I had my wallet with her picture in it. I persuaded them that I
                    liked girls. We always did a lot of entertaining in New York and we always
                    invited girls.</p>

                <p>WHITE: I thought it was very good, extremely good. At the time, we had language
                    training. I had Spanish, intensive Spanish. We took a field trip to New York and
                    we went to the U.N., I believe. We went to different places in New York. I
                    thought it was a very good course and top-notch people there. There was one
                    person there that was trying to persuade us - he seemed like an atheist - that
                    we had to have an open mind about different religions of the world. We sort of
                    discounted what he had to say, and kept your own view of things.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Haxie Lee Smith, or something, there, a linguist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's right, they had two people in the language class; I thought that
                    was very good. They had a linguist and a native speaker of the language. And
                    eventually, I got qualified in both French and Spanish in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your fellow classmates. Were they pretty much
                        alveterans at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think so. I was one of the oldest ones. So it is possible that a number
                    of them were too young for much service, if any, in World War II. I know one was
                    a captain. They were all highly educated and a fine group of people in my
                    judgment; I think maybe two made ambassador. They all had substantial careers, I
                    think. Some left the government to go into banking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given any choice of where you would go, or was
                        this ithe laps of the gods?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think it was in the laps of the gods. I didn't really care where I went.
                    They could send me anyplace they wanted to. I had that view all the way through
                    the Foreign Service; if they said they wanted me to go to someplace, well, I'd
                    go there, and make friends and actually end up liking the place.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was assigned to Bogot�, Colombia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We went by plane from Miami, but I remember when we got a third of the way
                    from Jamaica to Barranquilla, Colombia, we had engine trouble and we had to go
                    back. So we spent the night in Jamaica, which I liked very much. It had such a
                    nice tropical atmosphere. And then we went on the next day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bogot� from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I got there around January '52, and I spent three yearthere. I think I
                    left around December '54. Three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Colombia like when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, the big event was the “Bogotazo” in '48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, the Liberal party was pretty much in control - Alfonso Michelsen and
                    Eduardo Santos - during the thirties. In the 1946 elections, the Liberals were
                    split with two candidates, Gabriel Turbay Ayala, a moderate, and Jorje Eliecer,
                    a populist on the left. The Conservative candidate Mariano Ospina Perez won the
                    election because of this split in the Liberals. At first he had Liberals in his
                    cabinet but eventually they were excluded. The Liberals united behind Gaitan for
                    the 1950 elections. Then Gaitan was assassinated at a time when the OAS was
                    meeting in Bogota. The resulting outbreak of violence was called the “Bogatzo.”
                    About 1,500 people were killed and 20,000 wounded.</p>
                <p>The Liberals stayed out of the 1949 elections and the Conservative candidate
                    Laureano Gomez. He was the publisher of El Siglo, the Conservative newspaper. He
                    was way on the right side of the conservative party. He didn't have any Liberals
                    in his government. He admired Franco and he wanted to have a constitution that
                    would be more or less along the Phalangist lines of Franco.</p>
                <p>He was always anti-American, but in spite of all that, he sent a battalion to
                    Korea during the Korean War. I think at that time he was thinking that the
                    United States was the principal protection against communism, so as far right as
                    he was he thought we were the best alternative for a lot of leftist activity in
                    Colombia. It wasn't safe to go into certain regions of the country at that
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>When I was still there, they had a coup by the military, the first one in a
                    hundred years. It was led by General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, chief of staff of
                    the army. At the time both Liberals and moderate Conservatives preferred Rojas
                    Pinilla to Laureano Gomez with his new constitution. So Rojas Pinilla was
                    approved as president and later he was elected for a full term as president. But
                    eventually he became dictatorial and unpopular.</p>
                <p>And then after that the Conservatives and the Liberals got together in 1958 and
                    decided they would have sixteen years of alternating the presidency. The first
                    one was Alberto Lleras Camargo, and he was a very good man on the Liberal side.
                    At one time, he came into my office for a visa for him and his wife when I was
                    in charge of the consular section. I knew his background. Both he and his wife
                    had diplomatic passports. I was pretty new to the game and the regulations did
                    not say that as an ex-president he was entitled to a diplomatic visa. At the
                    time he was the publisher of a weekly magazine like Time, called La Semana I
                    knew that he was a good friend of the U.S., that he had been secretary general
                    of the Organization of American States, and that he had briefly been provisional
                    president of Colombia in 1945 when President Alfonso Lopez resigned. I did not
                    want to have him bring in wife so that both could be fingerprinted for tourist
                    visas.</p>
                <p>So I explained to him my situation. He said, “Well, what kind of visa did you
                    give Alfonso Lopez?” So I looked it up. Lopez was an ex-president and we gave
                    him a diplomatic visa. So we had a precedent and I was delighted. Later I found
                    I probably could have decided it all on my own in spite of all those
                    regulations, but I was new to the game and I was in charge of the consulate,
                    responsible to Congress for every visa I issued.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived there, what was your first job? WHITE: I was first a vice
                    consul in the consular section. The consul was Bill Kane. His wife and children
                    had returned to the United States. Bill was living alone and suggested we get an
                    apartment together. He was handling German passports and everything connected
                    with the Germans. He was also handling the immigrant visas and I was handling
                    the non-immigrant visas and the citizenship. Then after a while they rotated me
                    into the economic section under Tom Campen. Then when Bill was transferred they
                    put me in charge of the consular section as the only officer there. I liked
                    consular work as well as economic work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: At first we had Capus Waynick. He was a newspaper publisher in North
                    Carolina and a political appointee. After that we had Rudy Schoenfeld, who was
                    career man, an old bachelor. He was ambassador in Guatemala before coming to
                    Colombia. In London during World War II he was minister to the representatives
                    of governments-in-exile. On the whole I've always preferred career ambassadors
                    to political appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the consular section, was there much of a demand for
                        visitors'visas; I mean were many people going from Colombia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: There was a huge demand. The waiting room was always full. Visa applicants
                    had to make an appointment and you had to check to see if they were excluded by
                    our legislation. The U. S. came out with new visa regulations while I was there,
                    excluding over 20 categories of people.</p>
                <p>It was difficult to give people visas without forcing them to wait for our
                    security check. We had lookout cards going way back to the war years and we
                    frequently had to get into old files that were not in the consular section. I
                    remember we had a lookout card on one man and we didn't get clearance in time
                    for him to make his plane. The investigation showed there was nothing against
                    him. I felt so badly about it that I invited him and his family to dinner and
                    gave them their visas and made some friends that way. I felt a great
                    responsibility to abide by the law in issuing visas. But I thought it was great
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did you find you were supported by the Colombians
                        thawere working for the embassy, the FSNs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Oh, they were great. Actually, I would say that the ones I had were great.
                    But the one that was a staff employee before I got there in the visa section was
                    selling visas, so they removed him. He was gone by the time I got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the drug problem at all_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE:I don't recall in any big drug problem like they and we have now. We did
                    have to inspect coffins in which bodies were being shipped back to the States to
                    see if there was some contraband inside. I know of one case where we had an
                    airplane accident and an employee of Texaco's plane ran into a military plane
                    and he was killed. I was supposed to go and check whether there was just his
                    body in the coffin or whether they stuck something else in there, too. That went
                    back to the old days of Prohibition, I guess. I don't recall any great concern
                    about drugs at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the consular section most of the time, or did
                        yomove around at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WHITE: I moved around. I worked more time in the consular section than in the
                    economic section. But they were rotating me. I thought it was very good
                    experience. The problem with the economic section at that time was the lack of
                    statistics on Colombia; it made it very difficult to do economic reporting; they
                    didn't have the statistics themselves. I had excellent relations with the chief
                    of statistics in Colombia. He used to invite me to parties in his home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a lack of organization or was there a demand for
                        statistics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I think there was a demand, but they just didn't have them; they
                    didn't have it organized properly. If they had them, they'd give them to you. We
                    had very good relations with the Colombian government when I was there; I had
                    good relations with all the officials. I loved the Colombians. I used to date a
                    lot of Colombian girls. Frequently they were chaperoned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with protection and welfare
                        oAmericans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We did; I had one case of a guy with schizophrenia, a big guy, and he was
                    trying to commit suicide. I used to go out to the insane asylum where they were
                    keeping him. They kept him very well, but we had to repatriate him, and I had to
                    arrange to fly him to Panama and put him on a Navy vessel.</p>
                <p>The American Society gave me some money to get clothes for him. I took him up by
                    plane to Panama and spent the night with him in a hotel in Panama City. I was a
                    little worried because he was a big guy and suicidal, and they had a balcony
                    right outside the window. He'd step out there every now and then, and I'd have
                    to watch him.</p>
                <p>I put him on a train the next day and took him over to Colon where I put him on a
                    Navy ship that took him to New York. They sent us a message that they'd put him
                    in a straight jacket as soon as they got him in New York. But I was lucky
                    because he was docile all the time he was with me.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of welfare cases there. I had to go down to the jail when Americans
                    were incarcerated for one reason or another. I would offer to get them an
                    attorneyI thought it was all very interesting and I wouldn't have minded doing
                    more consular work at other posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was jail for Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WHITE: They treated Americans pretty well, I think. I know I went to visit one
                    American down there, he'd gotten in a brawl and he showed me a knife, and he
                    said “I'm glad they didn't find this knife on me.” So we saw that they got a
                    lawyer, and kept an eye on them. They probably treated Americans better than
                    they did the Colombians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the ambassador pay much attention to you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Ambassador Schoenfeld did. When I went to get married in Washington, he
                    wanted us to call on his mother and to bring him 10 boxes of candy back. I think
                    we were on very good terms with Ambassador Schoenfeld. He seemed to think I was
                    doing a good job as chief of the consular section.</p>
                <p>Now Ambassador Waynick for some reason had the idea that I was down there playing
                    poker in the Jockey Club and criticizing the president of Colombia. But I had
                    never been in the Jockey Club, and I hadn't played poker since I was in
                    Colombia. And I certainly wouldn't criticize the president or any other
                    Colombian official. I had great respect for all of them. The ambassador finally
                    found it was someone else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you meet your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I met her to a certain extent through my boss, who was of Czech descent,
                    Bill Kane - he was originally Bill Kubalik. His family had emigrated to the U.S.
                    but eventually returned to Czechoslovakia. He joined the embassy as a visa clerk
                    in Prague, eventually worked up to consul, and he knew a lot of Czech refugees
                    in Bogot�. Since we went to many things together I also got to know many of the
                    Czech refugees.</p>
                <p>I was sympathetic to the Czech refugees; I was sympathetic to anybody who was
                    anti- communist or anti-Nazi and for democracy. The Czechs were telling me what
                    wonderful wives Czech women make. So I said in a joking way, “Maybe I should get
                    a Czech wife.” So they took me seriously and one of them fixed me up with
                    Dagmar.</p>
                <p>All the Czechs there knew her family, because her father was one of the top
                    generals over there in World War II. After the country was occupied by the
                    Germans in March 1939, he escaped the Germans surveillance and went to fight in
                    France. When the French collapsed, he went to London and served as President
                    Benes' military adviser. He had also been in World War I, fighting in Russia for
                    Czechoslovak independence, and came out as a colonel. So the Czechs there all
                    either knew him personally or by reputation and thought highly of him. When the
                    Communists took over Czechoslovakia in 1948 he came with his family to the
                    United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The family settled in Washington. They'd been there just about five years when we
                    met Dagmar. So I thought that there would not be any problem with marrying
                    Dagmar, because she had received a university education in the United States.
                    She had gone three years to Charles University and three years to the
                    Conservatory of Music in Prague before coming to the U.S. In the U.S. she went
                    to the University of Kansas and got a degree; she went to the Julliard School of
                    Music and got another degree; she went to Columbia University and got a master's
                    degree. She spoke five languages. She was 26 and a beautiful girl. We hit it off
                    right away. I thought she would be a great asset. I was right and we are still
                    married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation then if you became engaged to a
                        foreignational? What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Then you would have to get permission to marry. One of my officers in
                    Nicaragua had to wait maybe a year for approval for him to marry a girl from
                    Guyana. I'm sure that they would have authorized the marriage to Dagmar, because
                    her father was working with the Pentagon, he was anti-communist, he was
                    anti-Nazi, and pro-democratic. In fact, her brother was engaged to the daughter
                    of the American ambassador in Prague at the time; eventually it broke up, but
                    they were well connected and I didn't think there would be any problem in that
                    respect.</p>
                <p>Anyway, she got citizenship two days before we got married. And actually the time
                    in Colombia didn't count against her because they passed a special law in
                    Congress to authorize her to get citizenship. Just in time for the marriage. She
                    had come to Colombia after graduating from Julliard because she had a contract
                    to teach in the Colombia National Conservatory of Music. She was also
                    continually singing with the National Symphony and giving recitals. Eventually
                    she had a regular television program with selections from operas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, it hadn't. I had a number of people that came in that had Nazi
                    associations. Sometimes it was just a question of passing out Nazi propaganda,
                    and I turned a number of them down. But then we had a law come through that
                    unless they were concentration camp guards they could be eligible. A lot of them
                    had been detained in Colombia during the war, because Colombia was on our side.
                    I remembered some of those I had regretfully turned down that had become
                    eligible and I invited them to come in for a visa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It did. I am sure I turned some down because the files showed they had
                    Communist activities. I tried to be fair though. The file had to be pretty
                    convincing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a strong communist movement in Colombia at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was substantial. They weren't in the government, but they were creating
                    problems. Leftists, you know. I had some come in. You had to make a
                    determination whether they were real communists or whether they were just a
                    newspaperman keeping an eye on them. You had to be just, and their families, you
                    couldn't penalize the family for something the husband did. You had to be fair.
                    You had to make a decision in every case.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we concerned on the communist side with the universities? There is a
                    tendency in so many universities, particularly in Latin America and even
                    elsewhere, where the students become red-hot communists while they're in the
                    university and quickly become capitalists as soon as they get out and start
                    working for Daddy or something like that. Were you finding that the universities
                    caused a problem at the time?</p>
                <p>WHITE: They were having problems with the government, because the government
                    would go in reacting to some demonstration. The students would demonstrate and
                    celebrate - recognize the day when a student had been killed by the military.
                    Sometimes the government would shoot some of the demonstrators.. There were
                    problems like that. I don't remember any specific visa cases involving
                    students.</p>
                <p>I think there was a certain amount of communist sympathizers, but there had to be
                    a certain amount of anti-Americanism, too. Some would think like the Argentines
                    that the United States was an imperialistic power. You had to make friends and
                    show them that we were benevolent, that we really wanted to help Colombia.</p>
                <p>They had to learn that communism was a very bad system. A lot of the Latin
                    Americans have. You take the president of Brazil right now, Fernando Henrique
                    Cardoso. He used to be a Marxist; now he's free market. They have a lot of them
                    like that in Latin America.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WHITE: Jospin. He tried to deny it until recently. Actually, when Felipe Gonzalez
                    came in as prime minister in Spain, he was a Socialist. But he said he wasn't
                    going to make the mistakes of Mitterrand and was not going to nationalize
                    everything. He considered himself more of a centrist. And the government of
                    Spain right now is more of a centrist than a rightist. Actually, they're no
                    longer a pariah among nations. Spain has arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was social life like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was great if you could get out in a car and get around. Local
                    transportation wasn't any good—I had to buy a car. But we were invited every
                    place by the Colombians. That's the reason I think in many respects Latin
                    America is one of my favorite places; you always get invited, you always get to
                    know the people.</p>
                <p>We used to get invited places in Morocco, too, but it wasn't quite the same
                    relationship that we had with the Colombians, or the Nicaraguans, or the
                    Dominicanany place I served in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '54, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In '54, they said they were sending me to New Caledonia as vice consul;
                    now that's about as far as I could go away from home. As I have said, I didn't
                    really care as long as they didn't send us to a communist country. My wife would
                    have been very nervous in a communist country, with her father being with the
                    Pentagon. They could have nabbed her, and she didn't like communists because
                    they'd had a terrible time with the communists and Nazis back in Czechoslovakia.
                    I disliked them as much as she did, but I would have gone to a communist country
                    if the Department had wanted me to go before I was married. And if they still
                    wanted me to go I would have had to arrange for my wife to wait for me in the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>I told them I'd go anyplace, and I thought it would be very nice in New
                    Caledonia. Dan Montenegro, the consul, wrote me a nice letter. He said we had to
                    cover the South Pacific, all the islands there that were British or French
                    possessions. He said we had to travel a lot through the area and I thought it
                    would be very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You better explain where New Caledonia is for somebody who

                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WHITE: I would say it'd be about 1200 miles east of Brisbane in Australia. It's
                    an island about 200 miles long, 40 miles wide. About half the population was
                    French and half Melanesian. It had a lot of French culture there. Excellent
                    French restaurants. We got along well with the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was New Caledonia part of the French commonwealth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, it was a French overseas territory. They had a conseil general, a
                    local legislative body with mixed French and Melanesian membership. The main
                    decisions were made in Paris and the government was mainly in the hands of a
                    French governor and a French staff. At present they have more autonomy than they
                    had then and in about ten years there is an agreement to have a referendum on
                    independence..At the time neither I or my predecessors predicted that the
                    islands that were in our jurisdiction, like the Solomon Islands, the Gilbert and
                    EllicIslands, the New Hebrides Tonga, Fiji, and French Oceania (including Tahiti
                    would become independent countries. Now the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides,
                    the Gilbert Islands, the Ellice Islands, Tonga, and Fiji are all independent.
                    But New Caledonia and French Oceania remain dependencies of France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was New Caledonia having problems between the Melanesians,
                        anwho else was on there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, there were the people of French descent, the colons, the one's that
                    had been there for years. Some of them came, they claimed, as guards when the
                    island was used as a penal colony. I don't recall much agitation for
                    independence then or any conflict between the local French and the Melanesians.
                    Now there is an independence movement by the Melanesians and there has been some
                    agitation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Tonkinese there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had some of them, too. They were workers in the mines, different
                    places. You know Bloody Mary back in Mitchener's book Tales of the South
                    Pacific. I loved the book and it was made into one of my favorite musicals. It
                    dramatized the South Pacific for me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, we didn't have anybody above us. There was just a consul and a vice
                    consul. The Indonesian desk officer had the responsibility for the Pacific
                    Islands. The Office of Dependent Area Affairs in the Department was followed
                    developments closely and sent delegates to meetings of the South Pacific
                    Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were the consul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was the vice consul, at first, for the first year, but when Montenegro
                    left, they made me the principal officer. Two inspectors came out when I was the
                    sole officer there after Montenegro departed. They gave me a very good report
                    and it was no doubt on their recommendation that I was named principal officer.
                    After a few months Sam Wise was transferred from Palermo as vice consul. He came
                    with his wife, Mary, and a baby daughter. We found a house for them to rent near
                    the consulate. My wife and I had put so much work into the bungalow that we did
                    not want to move. Housing was very hard to find in Noumea and I recommended to
                    the inspectors that we should build housing for the staff if we stayed in Noumea
                    instead of moving to Fiji. The employees of the South Pacific Commission had
                    very nice homes that were owned by the Commission and I thought we should at
                    least have something equivalent to what they had..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We traveled. We had the South Pacific Commission there; we were a sort of
                    liaison with the South Pacific Commission; we attended their sessions, we kept
                    an eye on them.</p>
                <p>And then we had to travel to places like Fiji and Tahiti and give consular
                    services and report on what was going on there. I visited the New Hebrides and
                    reported on the situation there. I went to Fiji and Tahiti, reporting on those
                    places and doing consular work. I visited the Solomon Islands. People come in,
                    they want passports, they want visas. One thing or another. The Department
                    wanted us to travel even more than we did travel. But the wives didn't like for
                    us to be gone all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your main tasks? Were you basically reporting on
                        whawas happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We reported on what was happening, but there was not really a whole lot
                    happening. But I know in one case we had some Melanesian up in the New Hebrides
                    - Espiritu Santo - he'd gone up into the high hills there hunting boars and
                    found a skeleton and a crashed plane from World War II. There was a little
                    bracelet that said Howie Falten.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>So the French made a little coffin and sent all the remains down to us. We kept
                    them in our storeroom and got in touch with the Pentagon and finally sent them
                    to the U.S. I know the family were very glad to get them, but it wasn't Howie
                    Falten, Howie Falten got out. The person flying with him was the one who was
                    killed. That's a case where we were able to get somebody's remains back. After
                    the plane crashed in World War II there were search expeditions but they never
                    found the plane.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you run into feeling, particularly from the islands, of nostalgia for
                    World War II, when we were pumping a lot of aid and troops and money and
                    everything else in those areas?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I would think there would be a certain amount of that. Some Americans just
                    stayed on there. When I went to Espiritu Santo, they said they had “million
                    dollar point” where the Americans had shoved a great deal of equipment into the
                    ocean rather than transport it back to the States. One of the locals there
                    offered to take me scuba diving to see it all, but I just took his word for it
                    that it was there. I asked the British district officer in Espiritu Santo if I
                    could see the air field we used during World War II. He took me to see it and it
                    was still in fairly good shape. I took photos. The British and French were very
                    helpful on all of my trips.</p>
                <p>We had a little bungalow in Noumea. It was built by a Navy captain during World
                    War II for his own residence. He got court marshaled for it because he wasn't
                    authorized to do it. So we inherited it as a place for the vice consul. It
                    required a lot of work for my wife and me to make it habitable.</p>
                <p>The New Caledonians anticipated that if the Japanese moved beyond Guadalcanal,
                    New Caledonia would be next. One day they looked out and the harbor was full of
                    American Naval vessels, and they knew they were saved. So they have a very good
                    feeling toward the United States in New Caledonia. And the other islands I went
                    to, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the French were at this time pretty
                        touchabout Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They were, especially in 1956, when they had the war with Egypt over the
                    Suez Canal. We had not trouble with the French we knew in New Caledonia. But
                    there were some French who came down from Vietnam and seemed particularly
                    hostile because they thought we had not done enough to aid them there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Suez crisis.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WHITE: We didn't support them in that war. We actually got together with the
                    Russians and we called for a cease-fire. I had to travel through the Pacific and
                    call on the different people, the governor of the Fiji Islands and the governor
                    of Tahiti. The governor of Fiji, whom I had met in New Caledonia, invited me to
                    a dinner. Some of the British expressed disappointment that we had not supported
                    them in the Suez operation.</p>
                <p>The governor of Tahiti invited me to a reception, with the dancing girls and
                    native music. But he didn't seem to object one way or the other. I felt myself
                    that we were probably right in doing what we did, because as soon as the French
                    and Israelis and the British launched their attack on Egypt, the Russians
                    thought, “Well, that gives us a free hand to launch an attack on Hungary, “ so
                    they moved into Hungary and put down the revolt against the government and
                    communism there.. Q: It was not an easy time. Did you report essentially back to
                    Paris, or straight to Washington, or how did it work?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I usually reported to Washington. But in case somebody would request aid
                    in the Solomon Islands, I would contact London because they had an AID office
                    there that had responsibility foBritish possessions like the Solomon
                    Islands..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Solomon Islands under the Australians at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No. The Solomon Islands were under the British. New Guinea was under the
                    Australians. We didn't have any islands that belonged to Australia or New
                    Zealand in our district, although we did visit them.</p>
                <p>We had Tonga with the British, and Tonga is independent now. And Fiji is
                    independent. We didn't have Western Samoa (it is independent now), because they
                    were under New Zealand. And French Oceania is still a territory. But Tuvalu and
                    Kiribati are independent. And Vanuatu, formerly the New Hebrides, is also
                    independent. So it is a different situation now.</p>
                <p>Actually there's been some excitement recently in the Fiji Islands. Indians are
                    about 47% of the population, and they had an Indian prime minister. There was a
                    revolt by the Fijians, because they don't want the Indians to take over the Fiji
                    Islands. The Indians had been brought in years ago by the British to work on the
                    sugar plantations.</p>
                <p>I always reported on the situation. At that time, the Indians were getting to be
                    the majority; a lot of them have left since then. But that's the sort of thing
                    we would report on - the relationship between the Fijians and the Indians. The
                    Indians couldn't own land. The Fijians owned the land; Indians would have to
                    lease it. I met the Indian Commissioner in Fiji, a charming man, and he invited
                    me to dinner.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I recommended that we move the consulate from New Caledonia to the Fiji Islands,
                    because we owned land in the Fiji Islands and we didn't have any direct plane
                    connection between the United States and New Caledonia as we had when the
                    consulate was established. Mail would have to go by way of Australia and wait
                    for a plane to New Caledonia. Quantas, the Australian airline, flew to New
                    Caledonia every two weeks. The Fiji Islands were centrally located in our
                    consular district and it was served by Pan American Airways. After I left, the
                    consulate was moved to Fiji.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We'd go to Australia and there get a plane for the Fiji Islands. And then
                    we'd take Teal, the New Zealand airline, and go to Western Samoa, the CooIslands
                    and then Tahiti. I visited the New Hebrides by boat, taking my wife with me. I
                    also visited Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands by boat because I did it on the
                    way home. No one else had been there from our consulate. Lady Gutch, the
                    governor's wife, whom we had met in New Caledonia, invited us for lunch and put
                    her car at our disposal to visit Henderson Field, that we had used during the
                    war. The Governor was absent at the time. Honiara, the capital of the Solomon
                    Islands, was a new town established at the end of World War II. The center of
                    town was really just a circle of Chinese stores.</p>
                <p>Q: At that time, it was a little early, I take it there weren't men who had
                    served there coming back to look over the place? Veterans - Guadalcanal.</p>
                <p>WHITE: We were invited by another family for dinner in Honiara. Everyone seemed
                    to have a very high opinion of the Americans and how we cleaned the Japanese out
                    of Guadalcanal. I didn't hear of any veterans returning at that time. It
                    probably was a little early for anyone to want to come back to where they no
                    doubt had a very bad memory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you would go to one of these islands, like the Cook
                        Islands,would you let them know beforehand that you were coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I wouldn't do it in the Cook Islands because that was a New Zealand
                    colony, but I would in the case of Fiji. And in Tahiti. I would notify people I
                    was coming. They would broadcast the news on the radio for the people in
                    outlying islands to come for consular services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sorts of things would you be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WHITE: Well, there was visa work; you give visas, you give passports, notarials.
                    And we'd report on whatever conversations we had. We'd usually call on the top
                    officials if we could get an appointment and I always did get one..</p>
                <p>There was an Office of Dependent Areas in the Department; they were interested in
                    more participation by the local people in the government, and insurgencies of
                    any sort. There really weren't, that we knew of. The Melanesians have become
                    much more active in New Caledonia since I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much social life while you were in New Caledonia? What
                        woulyou and your wife do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Quite a bit. The French invited us; we didn't have a very good place for
                    entertaining, but we would entertain in a restaurant that would cater things for
                    us. On the Fourth of July we would have receptions at a local club there. We did
                    have small dinners in our bungalow.</p>
                <p>We knew the French very well. The French can be prickly on occasion, but my wife
                    speaks fluent French, and I did all right. We've always been rather fond of the
                    French we know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until what, '57?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, that was '55,'56,'57 we came back. And that was kind of unusual, too,
                    because my wife - I didn't realize it at the time - what a fear of flying she
                    had. Now she always reads these books on fear of flying, and she's gotten more
                    or less used to it. But we had a chance of going back by boat. So I took the
                    chance of going back by boat, and it just took 12 passengers; that's the way I
                    got to the Solomon Islands. At first they didn't want to take us on the boat
                    because we had a 2-year-old child, my wife was eight months pregnant, and the
                    ship had no doctor. They had to go to Australia and load up, they had to go to
                    New Guinea and load up; it was a Norwegian tramp steamer. It took us about seven
                    weeks to get back to the States.</p>
                <p>I thought that the Department would not like me taking so long to return and that
                    I would have to rush to Washington. I hurried back to report to duty, and I
                    think that was about May or June, and they said, “We don't have a thing in the
                    world for you to do until you start at Harvard in September.” I would have come
                    back in a more leisurely way if I'd known that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, they gave me a choice. They said, “We'll give you economic training.
                    Name three choices.” I knew Harvard had some very good economists. I knew that
                    Yale had some good ones. I knew that the University of Pennsylvania, the Wharton
                    School, had some very good ones. So I gave them in that order, and they gave me
                    Harvard first. That was the only time in the Foreign Service that I got a first
                    choice. And it was worthwhile. I really enjoyed it at Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the usefulness of the academic training
                        that yogot at Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Theoretically, it has always enabled me to understand the macroeconomics
                    of almost any situation. But I thought that from a practical matter there ought
                    to have been some course on the tools of aid, for example.</p>
                <p>You go into a country like the Dominican Republic, where we just got rid of
                    Trujillo, what kind of loans can you give, what kinds of technical assistance
                    can you give, what are the conditions for it? Can you get a 2% loan? Just what
                    are the possibilities?</p>
                <p>You don't get any of that at Harvard. And I didn't get any of it before going to
                    the Dominican Republic. That's something I would have thought would have been as
                    useful as the theoretical training I got. With the experience I developed later
                    I would have gotten it through briefings in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Harvard, what, '57, '58? Did any of your
                        courseseem outstanding that you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The professors were excellent. I have forgotten the names of most of the
                    professors. I do recall that Dr. Mason was very good on economic development. I
                    had an excellent Austrian professor on international economics. At one time I
                    remembered all of their names very well. There was an excellent teacher of money
                    and banking. Also I had a good teacher in public finance. I attended some of the
                    lectures by Henry Kissinger and I greatly admired him.. The Department did not
                    encourage us to get a master's degree since it just wanted us to get exposed to
                    the latest thinking. But I thought it would be a good discipline to try for a
                    master's degree. I missed some classes when I was moving the family to Boston
                    and when I was in the hospital three days with a kidney stone operation. But the
                    grades were good enough to get the master's degree.</p>
                <p>Q: By the way, when you were in the Foreign Service, you were there when
                    McCarthyism really hit. Did this affect you or the people around you at all?
                    This goes back to Bogot� and New Caledonia.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WHITE: They would have these cartoons in the Colombian papers about what a
                    buffoon McCarthy was and all that; they seemed to think all of us thought like
                    McCarthy did. I was opposed to communism, but I think the way he attacked the
                    army, the people in the State Department, the way he was going about it, he
                    didn't have any proof - I thought he was a disgrace; they had to get rid of him.
                    And eventually the Senate did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a nasty period. Did you feel concern, I mean were
                        peoplaround you being fingered as being communist and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: As I recall there was one person who had been prominent in the Roosevelt
                    administration, who was living in Colombia and working for the government. I
                    believe he was a suspect. He came in once for a notarial. It was the only
                    contact I had with him as he didn't move around in the circles I was in. There
                    was one Colombian journalist who was considered to be pro-communist who
                    criticized me in the press because I insisted on making one of his relatives
                    wait for a visit until we made our security check. We had a lookout card on the
                    individual</p>
                <p>Q: Not so much being pro-communist, but maybe disagreeing with the extreme right
                    win; sometimes this had a tendency to make the people following McCarthy think,
                    you know, labeling_?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I would be against any action against those people, because they were just
                    expressing their opinion, but I can't say that I knew any personally. I followed
                    the McCarthy trials and proceedings pretty closely, and I was always critical of
                    the way he was doing things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '58 you went to the Dominican Republic, was that
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I went back to Washington and was assigned to IN(Intelligence and
                    Research).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '58 to_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was there from '58 to '62. Four years. And I was working in the section
                    dealing with communist economics. And especially the foreign economic policy,
                    especially of China. I was dealing with China, writing reports on their
                    activities, and also the Soviet Bloc aid and trade in different countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I thought that was very useful, very interesting - that's when they were
                    expanding wherever they could. The Chinese were building things in all kinds of
                    places. I never had any sympathy for the Chinese communists. They were always
                    coming out with these slogans, such as “The East Wind is prevailing over the
                    West Wind.” But, of course, History has shown that the opposite is true.</p>
                <p>Now I think we have a Chinese Communist Party over there which may be Communist
                    in name only since it is privatizing at a rapid rate. It has opened the economy
                    to foreign investment and they have joined the WTO. There is some democracy at
                    the local level. They send about 50,000 students here every year.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were there, '58 to '62, what was happening in China, was this when
                    they started, what is it, the “third line,” this is when Mao was moving
                    factories away from the coast?</p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, actually I think I identified, and some people disagreed with me,
                    that around 1960 the Chinese and the Russians weren't getting along. They
                    expelled all of the Russian technicians. I was there when they had “The Great
                    Leap Forward,” when thousands of people were trying to build steel in backyard
                    furnaces, even using their agricultural instruments as pig iron. The result was
                    that millions died of famine and no steel was manufactured in the backyard
                    furnaces.</p>
                <p>We were asked if we could replace the Russians as a trading partner for the
                    Chinese. At that time I couldn't see it, because the Chinese were exporting
                    human hair and things like that. I couldn't see where we could replace the
                    Russians anytime soon as a market for the Chinese. Now, of course, we are
                    probably the biggest market for Chinese exports and the composition of their
                    exports has changed completely. But this wasn't when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find information coming out of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had radio sources; we would read FBIS (Foreign Broadcast Information
                    Service), and we had different places - Hong Kong. And we got information from
                    the countries where they were active, where they were offering aid; where they
                    were doing things, the trade; we got the trade figures pretty well. We knew what
                    they were doing and where they were involved. They were competing with the
                    Taiwanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any change when the Kennedy administration
                        came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WHITE: I think in Latin American things improved considerably under the Alliance
                    for Progress. They were impressed with Kennedy in Latin America. I think Kennedy
                    was very popular in Latin America. Nixon, on the other hand, went down and got
                    stoned in Caracas. They didn't think Nixon was very much a friend of Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>Of course things have changed a lot in Latin America. Practically no Latin
                    American country now except Cuba and maybe Venezuela is following an
                    anti-American policy. They want cooperation with the U.S. At that time that it
                    wasn't true. Argentina was difficult to live with at that time. We had problems
                    with countries like Peru with their policy of expropriation of American firms
                    and the extension of their fishing limits. And, of course, there was Cuba, which
                    was trying to foment leftists revolutions throughout Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your INR, you were looking both at Latin America and at
                        the FaEast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I was just looking at the foreign policy of the communist countries.
                    As it involved Latin America, of course, I was always looking at what they were
                    doing with the economic penetration of the communist countries in the developing
                    countries of the world. They were active in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Africa, because the Soviet Union and the
                        communisChinese put quite an emphasis on African countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We knew exactly what they were doing; we knew how many personnel they had
                    there, what the personnel were doing, what the loans were that were being drawn
                    down, what their projects were, and their trade promotion. A lot of those
                    African countries were following leftist policies at the time after they became
                    independent. They weren't permanent leftists; they just found it convenient at
                    the time to become leftists; and to deal with the Soviet Union as they were
                    suspicious of what they considered neo-colonialism. Very few of the countries
                    had a good investment climate at that time, nor do they have it now except for
                    natural resources, like oil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned with Soviet penetration, particularly
                        iAfrica, at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WHITE: We were concerned about it in West Africa in places like Guinea, Ghana,
                    and Mali - the countries that had recently gained independence from the British
                    and the French. The Portuguese still had Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea Bissau
                    and those countries did not get their independence until the mid-seventies. We
                    were concerned about the independence movements and which way they would go. We
                    were concerned about Zaire under Lumumba, but he was assassinated and an
                    anti-communist government took over. I am sure we welcomed it at the time. Haile
                    Selassie was still emperor of Ethiopia and was not deposed by a communist coup
                    until the mid-seventies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We knew exactly what they were doing, I think. We had our informants
                    inside the communist countries. We knew what they were doing and we were
                    countering wherever we could.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I know that I wrote a report in collaboration with some others on
                    communist penetration of Africa; and that was praised, because we detailed
                    pretty much what they were doing in Africa. I wasn't the only one responsible; I
                    was the main one, but some other people made contributions.</p>

                <p>WHITE: Let me see. I don't think we had much contact with the desks in INR. I
                    don't recall very much. Occasionally they would ask us for something..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in INR doing the Horn of Africa around this time,

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think that's the way it was in our place, too. I don't recall dealing
                    with the desk or asking them for anything. Maybe they got what product we
                    had.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: '62, yes. We went down there about six months after Trujillhad been
                    assassinated in May 1961.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Q: I thought I would stop at this point. So in 1962 we have you going off to the
                    Dominican Republic, and we haven't talked about that at all.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is July 17, 2001. Jack, do you know how your assignment to the Dominican
                    Republic came about? And then could you tell me a bit about what the
                    Republic_?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I think they probably sent me to the Dominican Republic because I spoke
                    very good Spanish, I was rated as fluent, and I had had economic training at
                    Harvard University. But the kind of work I had been doing in Washington when I
                    was working on the communist bloc wasn't exactly the sort of work that was
                    required in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>It really should have been somebody who was very familiar with the instruments of
                    AID, how we could help a new country that was recovering from 30 years of
                    dictatorship. I had to learn on the spot by actually doing it.</p>
                <p>I think the first question the consul general - we didn't have diplomatic
                    relations at first, we were just establishing diplomatic relations, because
                    there were sanctions by the OAS because of Trujillos's interference in
                    Venezuela. So he asked me what was the cheapest interest we could give on loans.
                    I did a little research and I said 2%, but I don't think I was very well
                    qualified to say what kind of loans we could give at that time. Later we gave
                    them a loan at zero percent. Now I would of course be a lot more competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Dominican Republic from '62 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: '64. Two years there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Calvin Hill. He made a good impression on Kennedy because of the way he
                    handled things after Trujillo's assassination., Some brothers of Trujillo tried
                    to return and take control of the country. We sent some naval forces off the
                    coast there and when the brothers saw these forces they knew we opposed their
                    return and they left quickly. I think Calvin Hill was in charge of all that
                    period there. They asked him how he could be rewarded, and he wanted a
                    promotion, from FSO-3 to FSO-2. He got the promotion but died soon afterwards. I
                    recently read an excellent novel, The Feast of the Goat, by the Peruvian writer
                    Mario Vargas Llosa about the last days of Trujillo and the aftermath of the
                    assassination. He spoke highly of Calvin Hill in the novel.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political and economic situation in the
                        DominicaRepublic when you got there in '62?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was actually in turmoil. Under Trujillo it had a fairly stable
                    government; he had done some things like building infrastructure, promoting
                    exports; the economy was based on sugar and bauxite at that time. Trujillo in
                    the 31 years of dictatorship had not allowed any opposition. There wasn't much
                    in the way of foreign investment. The climate wasn't particularly good at that
                    period, but we agreed to establish diplomatic relations when Organization of
                    American States (OAS) sanctions were lifted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was economic officer. I was the second in command. Harlan Bramble came
                    down as economic counselor. He had been in the Economic Bureau of the Department
                    working on commodities. He himself had to familiarize himself with getting aid
                    to a country like the Dominican Republic - what we could do to help them.
                    Eventually Newell Williams, a former oil company executive, was assigned as AID
                    director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Trujillo government pretty well run the economic
                        siddown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think it was probably a dictatorship that was efficient in some
                    respects. He didn't permit any opposition. But he wasn't president all the time.
                    He had somebody else as president about half of the time. The OAS imposed
                    economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic in 1960 and all of the OAS members
                    broke off diplomatic relations and imposed economic sanctions. This had a
                    negative impact on the Dominican economy.</p>
                <p>In '61 Joaquin Balaguer was president and he was right of center. But he was
                    efficient, and later he was elected president for about 22 years, of and on. So
                    he competed in political campaigns later, and he was found to be the person who
                    could run the country most efficiently. They had elections and occasionally he
                    was replaced. The house we rented in Santo Domingo was next door to Balaguer's
                    home on Avenida Maximo Gomez. He was in exile in New York at the time, but his
                    sister used to play a cassette with his speeches loud enough for us to hear
                    them. Mario Vargas Llosa in his novel seemed to have a good opinion of Balaguer
                    as an astute and calm politician, who knew how to get things done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a ruling class, or were there various centers of
                        power,or what were you dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WHITE: We were dealing with the business class that were trying to do business;
                    they did business under Trujillo. None of the Trujillistas were in charge of
                    government. The Bonnelly government tried to purge the government and military
                    forces of Trujillistas. Some 1,300 officers and men and about 7,000 civil
                    servants with links to Trujillo were forced into retirement. In the government
                    departments; there were rather young people, rather inexperienced. The ministers
                    were frequently young people. It was hard to get statistics, and hard to get
                    people who were really too well informed. They were finding their way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there American businesses that had been doing
                        business therthat were continuing to do business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: There were. There was investment in sugar, in bauxite, different
                    industries. I always tried to have good relations with the American business
                    community. I always felt that ultimately the private sector had to be strong. In
                    every country I went.</p>
                <p>Q: The bauxite and sugar people, the Americans - were they having to deal in a
                    new situation? Had there been the equivalent of cozy deals with the Trujillo
                    regime that they had to have work at a different level with the new regime?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I think they probably prospered under Trujillo more than they did in the
                    transition period because of the instability. I know they sometimes had trouble
                    getting money that was owed to them by the government. The oil companies in
                    particular were trying to collect money owed to them. But I always looked on
                    them as people who performed a service there in the Dominican Republic. I did a
                    report on all the Trujillo business enterprises that had to be sold off, and the
                    government was willing to sell them to people that would invest. Eventually a
                    government department was organized to manage all of these firms.</p>
                <p>Calvin Hill was replaced by a political appointee as ambassador. This was John
                    Bartlow Martin. He was particularly interested in the Dominican Republic for
                    some reason and had asked for the assignment. He was President Kennedy's
                    speechwriter. He was very liberal; I think he was a member of Americans for
                    Democratic Action. He was suspicious of the business community.</p>
                <p>I always thought we should get the business community to be on our side, be
                    progressive and do various things that would benefit the country. We had some
                    problems there with the business community, some antagonism toward the
                    embassy.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WHITE: They had gotten a group together, right of center called the Union Civica
                    National. This was Rafael Bonnelly's party. Balaguer stayed on until the OAS
                    sanctions were lifted in January 1962; after that the opposition to Balaguer
                    selected Rafael Bonnelly to serve as a provisional president until democratic
                    elections could be held in September. Bonnelly would not be a candidate.</p>
                <p>In '63 they did have elections, and they elected Juan Bosch, who had been an
                    expatriate. His party was the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano, a left of
                    center party. I don't recall how he made a living in exile, but I do have a book
                    of short stories he wrote. So he may have been a writer. I did not think that
                    Juan Bosch was a communist because he made a number of anti-communist
                    statements. He described Communism as “death, war, destruction, and the loss of
                    all we own.” The right-wing opposition thought he was too far left.</p>
                <p>I thought he was on the left but non-communist. And I think the embassy agreed on
                    that. Eventually the military and some of the business groups decided that they
                    were going to have a coup after he was only president about six months.</p>
                <p>So they had a coup to remove Juan Bosch. And they put in a triumvirate to rule.
                    And then they had a revolt latethis was after I left - by the ones that
                    supported Juan Bosch. This developed into a civil war in which we had to
                    intervene to protect American interests and property.</p>
                <p>Eventually that intervention broadened into an OAS intervention. The occupation
                    lasted until they finally had elections, and they elected Hector Garcia Godoy as
                    president. He was the foreign minister under Juan Bosch, so he was in the
                    Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (Dominican Revolutionary Party). That was
                    after I left, though.</p>
                <p>Q: How were relations with the political and the business groups there - did
                    people get together all the time for social and business occasions, was it easy
                    for the embassy to_?</p>
                <p>WHITE: It was easy enough once you identified the people who were not tainted by
                    being Trujillistas. We got along rather well with the people in the junta once
                    it was clear that they would prepare the way for elections. I got along well
                    with the business community. We had our contacts in the political parties. But
                    we tried to avoid contacts with anyone who had a Trujillo connection. Ambassador
                    Martin didn't want us to rent any housing that had a Trujillo connection. The
                    director of the Peace Corps had rented a house with a swimming pool owned by one
                    of Trujillo's mistresses, but had to give it up. Before the ambassador arrived I
                    had rented a house owned by Trujillo's doctor, who was in Miami.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at it, do you feel the embassy could have done more, or was there a
                    sort of anti-American feeling that was set up - going to be insulted or put out
                    no matter what happened?</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WHITE: No, I think actually the feeling toward the U.S. was rather positive by
                    the Dominicans who were looking to us for help. Many, many Dominicans wanted to
                    go to the United States; we had long lines waiting for visas. There was some
                    anti-Americanism, of course. I remember one occasion when my wife and I visited
                    our USIS office in Santiago, one of the other Dominican cities, a young man
                    offered to go with us in the car to show us where the office was located. We
                    were told that a short time before he had gone with a mob to demonstrate against
                    the office. Later someone saw him in line to get a visit for the United States.
                    He explained that, if you couldn't beat them the best thing to do was join
                    them.</p>
                <p>They wanted us to do things, but they wanted it done right away. But we couldn't
                    administer aid right away without making some kind of feasibility studies We had
                    to study the situation and find out what the needs were and how we could help
                    them. We did intend to help them as long as they were democratic, and headed in
                    a democratic direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there pockets of Trujilloists, or were they pretty
                        well gonby that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They were always there, of course. They were there, and they profited
                    under Trujillo and they didn't think the country was going in the right
                    direction. Some of the business people were behind the coup against Juan
                    Bosch.</p>
                <p>But I think when Balaguer came in again as president and was right of center,
                    they were satisfied with the government. Though occasionally Balaguer was
                    replaced by somebody who was in the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano, which is
                    on the left, there were no coups after the one that occurred right after I left
                    the Dominican Republic. There appears to have been orderly elections.</p>
                <p>Balaguer was president from 66 to 78 and again from 86 to 96. He was in his
                    nineties when he finally agreed to step down. They have had regular elections
                    since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the president when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Rafael Bonnelly; he was just an interim president. He was somewhat right
                    of center. The business people were satisfied with Rafael Bonnelly. He was fair.
                    I was also there when Juan Bosch was inaugurated. I remember going to his
                    inauguration and my wife's chamber music group in which she sang, provided a
                    concert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about aid programs; what sort of things were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WHITE: We were giving them some loans at the lowest interest rate we could
                    possibly give, so that they could finance their imports. We were providing
                    technical assistance for agriculture. We started a Peace Corps program. We saw
                    the possibilities for developing tourism and were considering loans for this
                    purpose. Ambassador Martin took personal interest in a clinic in Higuey.</p>
                <p>During the two years I was there, I did work closely with the people who gave
                    them aid; and we were giving them aid, as long as they were headed in a
                    democratic direction. We curtailed it, I think, when the coup happened, until
                    they agreed to have elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the coup happened after you left, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, the coup happened while I was there. The civil wahappened after I
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you and how did the embassy respond when the
                        coup camabout?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We cut off relations, at first. But then we talked to the coup leaders,
                    the triumvirate, and they agreed to prepare for elections. When they agreed to
                    set up elections, we restored our aid program and we started to work with
                    them.</p>
                <p>We knew the people in the coup pretty well. They had some fairly good - I mean in
                    the junta - we knew them very well. I think some of them were pretty good
                    people; Donald Reid Cabral was the leader.</p>
                <p>They did have elections eventually, and they did elect somebody who was on the
                    left. But not far on the left. He was just left of center, I would think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding Bosch a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think the ambassador may have found Bosch a problem; he had a lot of
                    discussions with him. In fact, Ambassador Martin wrote a book about his
                    experience, in which he detailed his discussions with Bosch._</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Overtaken by Events, I think it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WHITE: Is that it? I believe it was. I read the whole book. I think he used to
                    get frustrated with Juan Bosch; but after all, Juan Bosch was elected
                    democratically, and it was better than having a coup. We should have had more
                    patience with him. We were always concerned about any sympathy for Castro, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that our help and our attitude set
                        up thcoup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I don't think so. We actually were very cool to the coup; we didn't like
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to travel much in the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, I did. I went all over the place. They were trying to promote
                    tourism. They were trying to develop the northern part of the country; they had
                    a Jewish settlement up in the northern part of the country. Trujillo wanted a
                    humanitarian image and he allowed some Jewish people to settle up in the north.
                    They had some dairy businesses up there. Also I visited the eastern beaches of
                    the Dominican Republic with some Dominicans and I could see the possibilities
                    for tourism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression - was money trickling down to
                        thfarming community, or was it pretty poor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I don't think so; not at that period; it was too early, after the
                    Trujillo period. During the period there was a tremendous amount of poverty and
                    a lot of unemployment. Since I was there, a great many Dominicans have emigrated
                    to the United States. And I am sure that their remittances home have helped the
                    Dominican economy. The tourist business has grown a great deal since I left.</p>
                <p>I've always thought that globalization was the answer to economic development in
                    many countries of the world. The countries that wanted foreign investment would
                    have to improve their investment climate. And the ones that didn't want it would
                    have to learn by observing its contribution in other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were relations like in this period with the
                        Haitians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WHITE: The Dominicans never trusted the Haitians, because the Haitians took over
                    the Dominican Republic for twenty years, from about 1820 to 1840. Trujillo made
                    some border adjustments with the Haitians, killing a number of Haitians who had
                    come into the country illegally. There was always a certain amount of pressure
                    because of the overpopulation in Haiti. I don't think the relationship with
                    Haiti was ever comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Castro messing around in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, he was. He came in in '59; he was trying to expand his influence any
                    place he could in Latin America. He was successful in some places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume we were on the watch for it very closely in
                        thDominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Oh, we didn't want any Castro influence there. If we thought Bosch was
                    under Castro's thumb, we certainly wouldn't have supported him. But he professed
                    to be anti-communist; he cracked down on the communists. This is as I remember
                    it. Maybe those who were in the political section would have a different
                    version. I always had a high opinion of Harry Shlaudeman, the political officer,
                    who became a career ambassador.</p>
                <p>Somebody on the political side would know more about it than I do, but I had the
                    impression that Juan Bosch was not really a communist or pro-communist, even
                    though he was on the left. The very fact that his party has had people become
                    president since he left - the first democratically elected one was Hector Garcia
                    Godoy - indicates that it really wasn't a communist party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Cuban missile crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They were very pro-Kennedy, the people in the junta, the people that took
                    over the government. I think practically everyone was pro-Kennedy, except the
                    communists.They were just waiting for us to recognize them and continue with the
                    aid and do what we could. We were helping in clinics and things like that, some
                    social projects of all sorts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the aid effort was pretty
                        effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WHITE: It might have been effective had I stayed there longer, but they would
                    have had to have a longer period. They were just getting started when I was
                    there the first year, and it didn't get very far the second year. But I think it
                    was beginning to be effective.</p>
                <p>I think the most effective aid program we've ever given them is just allowing
                    thousands of Dominicans to come to the U.S. and send their money back. And
                    they're all over the U.S. now; there's a huge population of Dominicans in New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that cause any problems for you all, political
                        pressure oanything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had the problem with the visas. We didn't have the personnel to handle
                    the huge mobs of visa applicants; they used to have riots in the lines for visas
                    at the consulate. Once they almost even attacked the consul because they thought
                    we were giving visas to Trujillo supporters, and they all hated each other. That
                    was a real problem, to be in the visa section. They all wanted to get out
                    because Trujillo didn't allow them to travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '64?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's right. The end of '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when all of you heard about the
                        assassination oPresident Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The transitional government had some sort of a ceremony there, with even a
                    coffin in memory of President Kennedy. That was the junta; they all favored
                    Kennedy and really admired Kennedy. The ones that we were dealing with in the
                    government were all opposed to Castro and any Cuban influence. I am sure they
                    had Cuban sympathizers in the country, but I don't think they were very
                    effective at that time. Those of us in the Embassy were very much in favor of
                    Kennedy's Latin American policy; the Alliance for Progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in '64?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I went to Nicaragua as chief of the economic section. But they'd reduced
                    their staff there. They had three people in the economic section, and they lost
                    their commercial attach�, so they asked me in the Department of Commerce that in
                    addition to being chief of the economic section that I also serve as commercial
                    attach�. I was very glad to have this title as I was always interested in
                    promoting our trade. We had another officer who was a commercial officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government situation in Nicaragua when you
                        got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It had been ever since about 1936, I would say, controlled by the Somoza
                    family. Anastasio Somoza, Sr. was assassinated in '56. He was in the National
                    Guard that we set up and trained during our long occupation of Nicaragua. We
                    thought this institution was necessary to provide some stability and guarantee
                    orderly and democratic changes of government. He was elected president and ruled
                    as a dictator. When he died, his oldest son, Luis Somoza, became president.Then
                    they had Rene Schick Gutierrez, who was pretty much a stooge of the Somozas. He
                    had been Minister of Education and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was a bit of
                    a womanizer. He used to flirt with my wife, who was a beautiful woman. Finally
                    it appears that he was getting ready to flee the country with his
                    daughter-in-law when he had a heart attack and died. There were ghastly photos
                    in the newspapers. I knew him rather well and he knew me be sight. He seemed to
                    be fairly popular. At the time Anastasio Somoza, Jr. (Tachito), was in charge of
                    the National Guard. He was a graduate of West Point..</p>
                <p>They had a good rate of economic growth, about 3.5% a year; and just about every
                    year that I was there you could say that there was economic growth and some kind
                    of stability that was favorable to U.S. business, favorable to the Central
                    American common market. I don't recall any excessive inflation. It was an
                    anti-communist government, of course. No communist countries were represented by
                    embassies. They were strongly opposed to Fidel Castro and communist Cuba.</p>
                <p>Tacho Somoza was eventually elected president. We were not partial to Tacho. We
                    just accepted the fact that he campaigned for the presidency and was elected.
                    The opposition to him was fractured, which made it easy for him to win.</p>
                <p>I think Luis Somoza was probably more effective than Tacho Somoza, but he died
                    while I was there. And he wasn't as harsh as his father. His father invited
                    Sandino to talks and then he had him assassinated when he came. Sandino was one
                    of the original people who fought against our Marines.</p>
                <p>I don't think the Marines made a very bad impression, though; they were asked to
                    come in by one of the factions because of the instability in Nicaragua. But we
                    were also in the Dominican Republic for quite a while, collecting the customs
                    and trying to bring some kind of stability.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I don't think there was enormous resentment of the Marine; a lot of Nicaraguan
                    women married Marines. The Marines helped out in their earthquake. We were
                    trying to establish a situation where they would have orderly changes of
                    government. And eventually, when it seemed that that was possible, the Marines
                    were withdrawn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As economic counselor, who were you dealing with in
                        thNicaraguan government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, we dealt with everybody. I could call on Somoza when he was
                    president. I could see President Schick at social events and discuss some
                    problem we might be having. I knew the president of the Central Bank very well
                    and even sent him to the U. S. on a Leader Grant. I always had good relations
                    with the Minister of Economy and the Chief of the National Planning Commission.
                    I could call on the Minister of Agriculture. The officials in Nicaragua were
                    very accessible. I had many contacts in the business community. I liked the
                    place and stayed there five years. I had many contacts and made a list of all of
                    them for my successor with a sketch on each of them.</p>
                <p>Somoza supported the Alliance for Progress; he did what he was supposed to do to
                    promote the Alliance for Progress. I think it got worse later when they had the
                    earthquake and he had the constitution changed, and had himself elected for
                    seven years. Then the opposition really got bad; it wasn't bad when I was there,
                    we didn't have much communist insurgency in the country. But after the
                    earthquake in December 1972 that killed around 10,000 people and left 300,000
                    homeless, repression of the communists increased.</p>
                <p>There was one event that sticks in my mind. Prior to the election for president
                    the opposition confronted the National Guard with the demand that it remain
                    neutral in the election process. That led to violence. Somebody shot at the
                    National Guard. I think it was Juan Parisi. Maybe he killed somebody. Then the
                    National Guard killed about sixty people. And the conservative opposition had
                    snipers on the roofs; they were shooting at people in the streets. The candidate
                    of the Conservative Party, Dr. Fernando Aguero, and his supporters retreated
                    into the Grand Hotel, holding a number of people, including Americans,
                    hostage.</p>
                <p>So we were faced with a situation. How could we get those hostages out? Our
                    commercial officer, who had been observing the whole thing for the embassy, was
                    caught in there, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Walter Cadette. After that, he retired from the Foreign Service. He had
                    part of his ear shot off when the National Guard surrounded the hotel and tanks
                    were blasting into the place and shattering glass.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I was in my home in the suburbs at the time. But when the DCM's wife called me up
                    and said, “There's something going on in town,” I went in to the embassy.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Aaron Brown and the DCM, Jim Engle, were there. We had tdecide what we
                    were going to do.</p>
                <p>The consul we sent down came back and said he couldn't get through the military
                    lines. And I said, “In the Dominican Republic sometimes we used our military
                    people for things like that, because they're recognized by the military.”
                    Colonel Francisco, who administered our military aid, had red hair and I knew he
                    would be easily recognized.</p>
                <p>So the ambassador asked that the military attach� Colonel Ladne and Colonel
                    Francisco come down, and Colonel Francisco got through the military lines and
                    talked to our people inside. Eventually we sent Ted Cheney, our political
                    officer, and maybe some others down, and they worked out an agreement to let the
                    people out. His daughter recently wrote an article in The Foreign Service
                    Journal on how he mediated this conflict So far as I know, they let everybody
                    out, even the people that were in the uprising, and didn't do anything very
                    drastic. I believe the opposition leader Fernando Aguero was under house arrest
                    for about six months. I thought the Embassy deserved a lot of credit for the way
                    in which it mediated this affair and no doubt saved many lives.</p>
                <p>Jim Engle, the Ambassador, and I were in the Embassy until about 2 a.m. when the
                    ambassador told Jim and me to go home so we could come back the next morning and
                    he would stay through the night.</p>
                <p>So when I came in the next day, Juan Parisi, the public enemy number one, who
                    fired the first shot - apparently, because his brother had been killed by the
                    National Guard - was in my office. He wanted asylum. And he stayed there all
                    day. I had to feed him, and his family kept coming in, but we weren't associated
                    with that uprising as far as I know.</p>
                <p>So I told the ambassador that I would take Juan Parisi down to the Venezuelan
                    embassy, where they did give asylum. We could give it in the case of hot
                    pursuit; but in this case, we didn't want to give asylum, we didn't want to be
                    associated with the uprising. I took him in my car down to the Venezuelan
                    embassy in the middle of town. But that was a little touchy because my car
                    wasn't operating. It kept chugging along; I didn't know what was the matter.</p>
                <p>But the next day when I went out to take the hostages who spent the night with us
                    to the airport my car broke down altogether. And later I saw that somebody had
                    cut the water hose. So I think somebody must have known I was going to take him
                    to the Venezuelan embassy, and they cut the water hose so I couldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out? I mean, you got the man to the
                        Venezuelaembassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, I got him there. They took him in because he was a friend. We didn't
                    want him all night in the embassy. We didn't want to appear to be involved in
                    the uprising in any way.</p>
                <p>One of the inspectors came through about a year later, and he grilled me on it.
                    He seemed to have had a report that the embassy was involved; but I don't think
                    it was. I told him, I thought the people in the political section always had
                    their contacts with the conservatives, and I had my main contacts with the
                    government, dealing with economic issues. I didn't really keep up with the
                    political opposition and didn't get invited to their affairs. I told the
                    inspector that I didn't think we were involved in any way whatsoever. We were
                    just observing what went on and maintaining normal contacts with the
                    opposition..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an aid program there, or were they
                        self-sufficient?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, they needed aid, and we had an aid program. I remember we were
                    building the Rama Road with a U. S. loan.. We were engaged in various projects
                    to help them; we gave pretty substantial aid. I know I got some Export-Import
                    Bank loans to build granaries. It was part of the Alliance for Progress. They
                    were in the Alliance for Progress just like all the Central American countries.
                    They had a Central American Common Market and I spent a lot of time reporting on
                    developments in the Common Market.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you feeling any political pressure while you were there, because the
                    Somozas had pretty good contact with certain elements within our Congress? I was
                    wondering if you felt any of that?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I didn't feel any political pressure at all. In one case, I decided to
                    recommend the president of the central bank, who was a good friend, always a
                    good contact, and I though he was a pretty able man, for a Leader grant in the
                    United States. Then Somoza fired him. And then he came in and said, “Well, do
                    you still want to send me to the United States on a Leader grant?” I said,
                    “Well, certainly. I think if you've got the abilities and capabilities_” So we
                    sent him to the States; I know Somoza didn't like it - the man they fired we
                    sent to the States on a Leader grant.</p>
                <p>Q: Of course, the whole idea is that it's not somebody that 's already in the
                    government, but somebody that's got potential. Isn't that part of the
                    promise?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I had that impression. And I knew that former Ambassador Brown had a high
                    opinion of the president of the Central Bank. Some of his enemies were saying
                    that he had been a communist as a student in Chile. But we had no evidence of
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>What would the Congress want us to do, that we didn't do? What kinof
                    pressure?</p>
                <p>Q: I was just wondering whether you were getting pressure from somebody in
                    Congress to, say, be sure to approve this particular aid request or
                    something?</p>
                <p>WHITE: No, I don't think so. But I don't think we would do it if we didn't think
                    it was a valid request, being useful to the country, just because somebody from
                    Congress thought it should be done. We might listen to it and consider it, but
                    that wouldn't be the determining factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: We had Aaron Brown as ambassador; he was a career man, a very good man. An
                    Excellent man. Then we had Kennedy Crockett, who had been a civil servant with
                    the Department and I think was “Wristonized” down there. He had been DCM in
                    Costa. He was a very good man; he was from Texas. So we had two very good people
                    there. I liked the embassy team quite a bit and I loved the Nicaraguan people. I
                    hoped we could do something about their poverty, which was extreme.</p>
                <p>I might add something at this point about my wife. She was very active in
                    cultural circles wherever we went. Tacho Somoza was married to an American, Hope
                    Portocarrero, whose uncle was Nicaraguan ambassador in the U.S. She asked my
                    wife to go with her one time to see the Conservatorio of Music in Guatemala with
                    the idea of establishing something similar in Nicaragua. Later Joaquin Chamorro,
                    the publisher of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, present my wife with an
                    award as the person who had contributed the most to Nicaraguan culture in that
                    year. After we left Chamorro was assassinated - some say by henchmen of Somoza -
                    and later when free elections were held his wife Violeta de Chamorro defeated
                    Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista, in the presidential elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the banana companies? Was United Fruit a power
                        therat that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, we had Standard Fruit, but I don't think they were a power. I went
                    over and visited their establishment on the Atlantic coast. We had the Bonanza
                    Gold Mines; I visited the gold mines too with Ambassador Brown. I don't think
                    they had any influence on the government, didn't try to influence the
                    government. Occidental Petroleum built a fertilizer plant. The government was
                    very glad to have these investors, as far as I could determine, and they wanted
                    even more U.S. direct investment.</p>
                <p>But the climate wasn't good in Nicaragua for foreign investment.Other countries
                    in Central America were more pleasant place to live.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, it's hot in Managua. In Guatemala it was much better. In Costa Rica,
                    the cities were more pleasant to live in and the climate was better. But as far
                    as being pro- American, friendly people, I think the “Nicas” were just about
                    tops.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I used always to be very sorry for the people in Nicaragua because they
                    were poverty-stricken. They had unemployment; they had a lot of poverty. Even
                    the wealthier classes did not seem particularly wealthy. And the problem was,
                    what could you do about that poverty? Even the Somoza government - they were
                    part of the Alliance for Progress - they were doing some things. The principal
                    cash producing exports were coffee and cotton. Both were very dependent on world
                    prices and there was a quota for coffee. Some Americans were there growing
                    cotton, but when the price declined they were forced to close down and return to
                    the U.S. With the exception of the Somoza family I didn't see tremendous wealth
                    there. But I always thought globalization was the way to deal with poverty in
                    these countries. Private investment. They have to have the proper climate for
                    it. I didn't think big government programs were the solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the ruling family? Did the Somoza family and
                        itoffshoots pretty well control everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They had a lot of land, a lot of property, a lot of companies. But Somoza
                    always said, “It's better that we invest our money here and create employment,
                    rather than invest it abroad.” But his companies were not always profitable.
                    Some owed money to American companies. I could have said we are not a collection
                    agency. But if I had some influence, I used it. I knew people in the business
                    community very well and was on good terms with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How successful were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I usually got it eventually. I was dealing with Somoza'people, and they
                    found the money one way or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have many Congressional groups coming down?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WHITE: We always had Congressional groups every place I've been. And other kinds
                    of groups. We had the Vice President come down - Rockefeller. Different
                    delegations. You know how it is in the Foreign Service. I don't think there's a
                    single country where you don't have these delegations. Of course, we didn't have
                    the big ones like those we received in Morocco.</p>
                <p>Q: No, no. Well, sometimes. I was talking to somebody that was ambassador to
                    Costa Rica, I think in the early '70s, who said the highest American government
                    official to come was the lieutenant governor of Mississippi. And he just
                    happened to have spent the night there. I realize this is in Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, I don't think we had an exorbitant amount, but every now and then
                    you'd have a delegation of somebody from Washington, even if it was only one of
                    the staff aides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the National Guard
                        operated anacted towards the people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They wouldn't be like Costa Rica, where they were nothing but a police
                    force; they had more control than that. There were firefights when they had
                    leftist opposition in the countryside - a few firefights when I was there. I
                    don't think it was as brutal as say Argentina and Chile during the seventies. I
                    was not a tremendous admirer of the National Guard, although we did create it
                    because we thought they could guarantee free elections, an orderly change of
                    government. But I guess they had to have some sort of an army. It wasn't any
                    worse than, say, the Guatemalan army or the Salvadoran army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During '64 to '69, there hadn't been many great changes
                        iNicaragua, had there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: There was the fact that they had the rate of growth of about 3.5% a year.
                    They had a pretty good economy as far as exports were concerned. I don't recall
                    much inflation. And they tried to make the investment climate good. They were
                    cooperating to a certain extent with other Central American countries in the
                    Central American Common Market. There were programs of the Alliance for Progress
                    that were going ahead.</p>
                <p>After I left it got worse, because then they had the big earthquake that killed
                    about 10,000 people and destroyed Managua. Then Somoza became more dictatorial.
                    And especially the communist activity became much greater.</p>
                <p>Eventually he stepped down because he was losing control. He ended up in Paraguay
                    where he was assassinated. And the Sandinistas came in at first with other
                    opposition groups, too, but then it became more and more leftist and more and
                    more dependent on the communist countries. An unfriendly government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I went to Rabat, Morocco, as economic counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '69 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: To '73. Four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I spoke French, so they were looking for somebody. I guess they thought
                    after the long period of time I'd served in all these developing countries, they
                    would send me to a developed country. At first they were going to send me to
                    Oslo, Norway. They said that the ambassador there wanted me as commercial
                    attach�. But my DCM thought I should try for an economic assignment. So I
                    waited. They gave me economic counselor in Rabat; I guess they thought that was
                    the closest thing to a European assignment. I didn't really mind being sent to a
                    developing country. I'd go anyplace and serve anyplace and make myself at home.
                    I always hoped it would be a non-communist country so I could take my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Morocco, '69 to '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: When King Mohammed V died in 1961, his son Hassan became king as King
                    Hassan II. They got independence in '56. His father died - King Mohammed V - and
                    Hassan II took over. At first he ruled as a constitutional monarch, but after
                    some riots in 1965 he dissolved the parliament and ruled henceforth by decree.
                    That was the situation when I arrived. We considered him to be a friend and
                    moderate on Middle Eastern issues.</p>
                <p>He tried to cooperate with the Arabs, but he was a moderate on Arab affairs, and
                    I thought he ended up, too, being a moderate influence in the Arab world. He
                    wanted good relations with France. Many Moroccans were working in France and
                    sending their remittances home, a big source of foreign exchange. France was
                    also Morocco's biggest trading partner and the source of much of its direct
                    foreign investment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the economic situation '69 to '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WHITE: I think there was a lot of unemployment. There wasn't much inflation. They
                    were the world's biggest exporter of phosphates. And they had big citrus
                    exports, too. And they had minerals. They had iron and coal. Lately, I think
                    they've had petroleum. They had vegetables they'd send to France, and so forth.
                    Tourism was one of the biggest sources of income. The French left a good
                    infrastructure. So it really wasn't too bad. But they financed a lot of their
                    budget with PL 480 wheat imports from the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about French influence? Were the French a pretty
                        stronhold on most enterprises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: The French had a very strong influence there, and a lot of the French were
                    still there. I think they made a real contribution. From a tourism viewpoint,
                    the hotels were all good in Morocco; the roads were good. It was a wonderful
                    place to spend a vacation - and safe. It wasn't like Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major interest when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I was interested in commercial matters, U.S. commercial interests and U.S.
                    investment interests - business interests. And I worked with the aid
                    administration, too, on things that we thought would help them, like the PL 480,
                    where they could finance their budget. Because it was a moderate government and
                    relations with the U. S. were good. In fact, Morocco was credited with being the
                    first country to recognize the independence of the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: It's true. Did you find yourself running up against an attempt by the French
                    to wall off Morocco from other than French commercial ventures?</p>
                <p>WHITE: No, we cooperated to a large extent with the French; we had good relations
                    with the French. We even had deposits in French banks. We didn't want to
                    antagonize the French in Morocco. We knew they had vital interests there. We had
                    no conflict with the French that I know of. The French Economic Counselor used
                    to let me read his economic reports, which were very good. The French commercial
                    attach� was also very helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever deal with Hassan or was that pretty much
                        thambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>WHITE: Hassan? I dealt with some of the ministers; but I was presented to King
                    Hassan and he usually made a lot of the decisions. I dealt with him through his
                    ministers. We had a problem with the Holiday Inn there. The Holiday Inn wanted
                    to build a hotel; but they weren't putting any money into it; they just wanted
                    to use their name and ability to get people to use it. The king didn't like it,
                    so he canceled the agreement after the hotel was built. He didn't think it was a
                    good deal for Morocco. That was one of the problems we had. We couldn't get the
                    King to change his mind on this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point we had a lot of bases there, but by this
                        point thbases had been disassembled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's right. We disassembled those bases. We moved up to Spain, but we
                    still had communications facilities. The personnel operating them were living at
                    the Moroccan base at Kenitra. The Navy operated a high school for Americans
                    there and my daughter and son attended it. Two years ago they had a reunion
                    there and many former students went back. Both of my children went with their
                    families. My daughter was one of the principal organizers. The place is a
                    Moroccan military base and the commander gave them a nice reception on the base.
                    They loved Morocco and had a wonderful time on their return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were at least two major attempts to kill the king.
                        Dithose happen while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In '71, there were five generals and about 1400 military cadets who raided
                    the king's palace at Skhirat where he was entertaining many guests and tried to
                    carry out a coup. In the shooting 28 dignitaries were killed, including the
                    Belgian ambassador. After about two hours units of the army loyal to the kind
                    came and rescued him</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during a birthday party, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, it was. His 42nd birthday celebration. They had a loof diplomats
                    invited there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: No, but our ambassador was. He was made to lie face down. The Belgian
                    ambassador spoke up and said he was a diplomat; they shot him. So they were
                    wild; but the question was, would the military remain loyal to the king? I
                    always thought they would.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>A labor officer in Casablanca, who later went on to be an ambassador and
                    assistant secretary for Middle Eastern affairs, had a long report saying that we
                    should not give all our support to the king; that his strength in the country
                    wasn't that strong. Those of us in the embassy thought that the king was our
                    best bet.</p>
                <p>Our labor officer, Ed Djerejian, wrote a brilliant report, which I'm sure
                    everybody admired. And we considered everything there, but we decided that the
                    king was our best bet. And I myself thought that the military and the people in
                    the rural areas would basically remain loyal to the king. He was descended from
                    the prophet; he was a fairly modern monarch. And after about two hours, he
                    talked his way out of it. He persuaded them to give up, and his loyal military
                    took over. Then they were all let go.</p>
                <p>Again the next year their was an attempt on the king's life. The officer who led
                    it appears to have been General Mohammed Oufkir, who we considered to one of the
                    most loyal supporters of the king. The dissident officers in the army who wanted
                    a change tried to shoot down the king's plane returning from France. The plane
                    was set on fire and they thought they had killed the king. The plane landed with
                    two engines on fire, but the king survived.</p>
                <p>Then the planes were shooting at the palace, too, which was just a few blocks
                    from where I lived. I was at the Embassy and my son called to say he had been on
                    the roof watching the planes flying over and shooting rockets at the king's
                    palace.</p>
                <p>And I myself was over at the Ministry of Commerce when they first got word that
                    the king's plane had been attacked. There was a lot of excitement there, but I
                    didn't know the reason for it. I had some usual business there. But they
                    suspected we were behind it because we had people at the Kenitra air base, where
                    the planes originated. But we, of course, had nothing in the world to do with
                    the thing. The king survived, but they found out that Mohammed Oufkir, the
                    minister of defense at that time, was behind it, so as I understand it he
                    committed suicide. He disappeared altogether.</p>
                <p>But his family ended up in confinement in some place in the desert for a good
                    many years. his daughter has just written a book on iabout how harshly there
                    were treated because of their father.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: There were some, but they were settled. They had problems with Libya. They
                    thought Libya was the one that had jumped to recognize that the coup - they said
                    the king had been killed. Libya jumped to recognize the junta government when
                    the king was still alive. I think Algeria held off awhile.They had the problem
                    with Algeria later, with the Spanish Sahara business. The Polisario.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they have the Green March during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: What do you mean by that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, I think, when the king led_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I know what you mean. This was in 1975 when the king sent maybe 350,000
                    unarmed Moroccans to Spanish Sahara to reinforce Morocco's claim to the Spanish
                    Sahara. Shortly afterwards, the Spanish left Spanish Sahara, assigning the
                    northern two-thirds to Morocco and the other third to Mauritania. Mauritania
                    eventually decided they wanted out because the Polisario were becoming active.
                    These were the local people fighting for independence. So then Morocco claimed
                    the whole area.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find American firms, were they able to deal in a straightforward
                    manner with the Moroccan authorities and business community?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I don't think it was completely satisfactory; I believe it was Goodyear
                    Tire that wanted to come down and establish a plant there, but the government
                    owned a tire-making plant, and they didn't want competition. So the Goodyear
                    representative didn't get an appointment. I couldn't get an appointment for him,
                    either.</p>
                <p>But there was a lot of corruption in the government. They said that one of the
                    reasons that some in the military had the attempted coup in '71 was because of
                    corruption in the government. There was corruption, and I was reporting on
                    corruption quite a bit; they removed a number of ministers and put them in jail.
                    The minister of tourism, I know was one. Then they put the minister of finance
                    in jail- he once entertained the ambassador and me at French restaurant in Paris
                    when we were there for a conference. Our ambassador did not think he was guilty
                    and he was subsequently released.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a time when an awful lot of young Americans were drifting around the
                    world - the hippies and all that sort of thing - and Morocco was one of the
                    places many went to get hashish and stuff like that. Did that cause any
                    problems?</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WHITE: I'm sure they caused the consular section a lot of problems. I know that a
                    lot of them were running around. I was down at the embassy one time when some
                    girls called up; they said, “We took this cab from Marrakech to Casablanca, and
                    the guy said he would do it for $20 and now he wants $50,” and they wanted me to
                    resolve it over the telephone.</p>
                <p>I talked to the cab driver. He said, “Gasoline costs $.50 a gallon. I couldn't
                    afford to do it for $20.” So it was his word against theirs. I knew that what he
                    was charging was a fair rate, because I had already pai$25 for a taxi from
                    Casablanca to Rabat, a much shorter distance; so I couldn't help them out over
                    the telephone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Moroccan society easy to get to know? I mean, were
                        relationpretty formal from your point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I think it was more of a formal relationship than Latin America. Of
                    course, you get very good friends in Latin America; they open up their homes to
                    you. A lot of them have families in the United States. A lot of them have
                    studied in the United States.In Morocco it is, as you say, somewhat more formal;
                    you did get invited to their places, but it wasn't quite the same as Latin
                    America. A bigger difference. I nevertheless made some very good friends in
                    Morocco and entertained many of them in my home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What ambassadors did you have while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: First I had Ambassador Tasca, he was a political ambassador, but he was a
                    very effective one. Sort of a career political ambassador. But he was only there
                    for a few weeks after I arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Stuart Rockwell in dealing with economic problems?

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: He always gave me all the support I needed. He was a very intelligent,
                    impressive-looking man. And then we had Richard Parker as DCM. Richard Parker
                    had a triple-bypass or quadruple-bypass operation, but afterwards he went on to
                    be ambassador in three different countries, including Morocco. We had a good
                    team in Rabat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Algeria, Morocco and Lebanon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes. So he has written books. I've seen him lately at Diplomatic and
                    Consular Officers Retired. Don Brown was Director of the AID (Agency for
                    International Development) mission.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved much with AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I went over there to their meetings, yes. But they were the ones making
                    the decisions. Sometimes, if it was a question of commercial versus aid, I would
                    frequently come down on the side of commerce. Q: '73 you were finished. Sounds
                    like it was about time to come home?</p>
                <p>WHITE: That's right. Yes.</p>
                <p>Q; So what did you do? Where did you go?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I went back to the Bureau of African Affairs. I was the commercial
                    coordinator on the economic policy staff. I had to travel around Africa quite a
                    bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '73 to '78.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That's when I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of African Affairs when you arrived in
                        '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Let me see who it was. Dick Moose was there when I left. David Newsom was
                    Assistant Secretary when I first arrived and for the first few months I was
                    there. After him there was Don Easum; later he was sent as ambassador to
                    Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: My job was to keep in touch with the various desk officers, and see that
                    we were commercially oriented, that we were taking advantage of the commercial
                    opportunities. I worked closely with Commerce, too.</p>
                <p>I traveled around Africa and talked to all the economic people in the embassies
                    there. We tried to get them to focus their attention managing their resources so
                    they could take advantage of opportunities for trade and commerce.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Later when I was there, the U. S. government had a policy of neutrality towards
                    investment. Probably the result of labor union activity. I thought that was sort
                    of a mistake, because I thought what many of them were interested in was
                    promoting investment from the U.S. in Africa to give employment. As a
                    counterweight to activity by the communist countries. A lot of them chose
                    African socialism. And they had close ties with the communist countries.</p>
                <p>I didn't think they were permanently that way - I thought they were opportunists.
                    We have some African presidents now that were Marxists 10 years ago and now they
                    profess to be democrats and in favor of the market. Several of them are like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From talking to people and from looking at it, it seems
                        likAfrican socialism has been pretty much a disaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: It was. It was a disaster everyplace. In Tanzania; it's a disaster in
                    Zimbabwe right now. Anyplace that they tried it, it was always a disaster. But
                    frequently they were influenced by the former colonial powers: like the Fabian
                    Socialists in Britain and the Socialists in France.</p>
                <p>The ones that tried more for an open economy, like Botswana and Mauritius have
                    done better. Ivory Coast used to be doing quite well at that time under
                    Houphouet-Boigny and Kenya under Kenyatta. Now they're having problems. Senegal
                    did fairly well with orderly changes in government. It's first president was
                    Leopold Senghor, a very good man. Right now there's a dearth of good leadership
                    in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the African leadership during
                        thi'73 to '78 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: They had authoritarian governments, and too many of them were oriented
                    toward the Soviets - like Zambia. Under Kenneth Kaunda, they nationalized
                    practically everything. In Malawi they had Hastings Bandar, who was a dictator
                    for many years. They had Kenyatta in Kenya. But he at least there was harmony
                    between the races in Kenya when he was there. They say he ended up a rather
                    wealthy man.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Kenya wasn't too bad in those days, and Houphouet-Boigny in Ivory Coast probably
                    was one of the more effective presidents. I thought he really was a very good
                    president. I didn't think much of Mobutu in Zaire. But the situation before
                    Mobutu, was even worse. Idi Amin in Uganda was not only a dictator of the worst
                    sort, but a buffoon. But Milton Obote who came before and after him was no
                    better. Julius Nyerere was the long-time ruler of Tanzania and was considered a
                    decent man - he translated Shakespeare into Swahili - but he was ruining the
                    country economically and there were many human rights violations. A bright spot
                    was probably Botswana under its first president Sir Seretse Khama, who was
                    married to an English woman. There was racial harmony in the country and the
                    country's wealth from diamonds was used for the benefit of the country. As I
                    recall Rwanda and Burundi had received their independence from Belgium but were
                    plagued with ethnic strife between the Tutsis and the Hutus. The Central African
                    Republic was being ruled by the dictator Jean Bedell Bokassa, who had himself
                    crowned as Emperor and finally massacred a number of schoolchildren because they
                    were not wearing the school uniforms manufactured in his factory. He was
                    arrested by the French after ruling about 13 years. Cameroun was relatively
                    stable under the rule of its first president Amadou Ahidjo. In the mid-seventies
                    General Felix Malloum was the president of Chad. In those year Chad was having
                    difficulties with interference by Libya in the internal civil conflict between
                    Muslims in the north and the non-Muslims in the South.</p>
                <p>In those years Nigeria had a population of close to 100 million and was one of
                    the world's largest producer of petroleum. In 1995 the corrupt and dictatorial
                    government of General Yakubu Gowon, who was the leader during the Biafran war,
                    was overthrown by Murtala Ramat Mohammed, who instituted reforms in preparation
                    for democratic elections. When he was assassinated Lieutenant General Olusegun
                    Obasanjo continued these reforms until there were democratic elections shortly
                    after I left the Bureau. He is now the president of Nigeria, having been elected
                    in 1999 for a second term.</p>
                <p>In South Africa the Boers were still trying to hold on to power but their
                    position was becoming more and more difficult. After the Portuguese colonies of
                    Mozambique and Angola became independent in 1976 the South Africans were
                    providing help to rebels against the socialist regimes in those countries. They
                    hung on to the territory of South West Africa which they had governed as a
                    mandate and were fighting the Swapos under Sam Nujoma. who wanted the
                    independence of that country. Namibia did not become independent until about 12
                    years after I left the Bureau.</p>
                <p>Some of the countries that we considered communist in those days have now
                    changed. Benin, for example, that was ruled for many years by Mathieu Kerekou, a
                    Marxist, now is considered democratic and pursuing an open market economy. I
                    could probably talk about the other sub-Saharan African countries, but this is
                    probably sufficient to suggest the changes that have occurred since the fall of
                    communism.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and trade. I've always said that Nigeria was a country of over 100
                    million and had tremendous oil wealth, and that was the place where they would
                    find the market if they were patient enough to develop it. Of course, there was
                    a lot of corruption in Nigeria. All over Africa. And there was a lack of regimes
                    of law in most of the countries to make them attractive for countries to
                    invest.</p>
                <p>And there were other oil countries, too. Gabon had quite a bit of oil. Angola had
                    oil, too. In fact, all during the communist years, they had Chevron producing
                    oil over in Kabinda, separate from the main part of Angola by Zaire. This oil no
                    doubt provided most of the foreign exchange for the Angolan government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: In what way would we help it? We'd give them investment guarantees. There
                    were some cases of expropriation that had not been resolved by the time I
                    left.</p>

                <p>WHITE: Well, we would. Especially in petroleum exploration. Even in the socialist
                    countries they would welcome investment in extraction industries; even though
                    our government was neutral to other investments, they would favor investment in
                    extraction. We promoted that as much as possible if we thought there was oil

                </p>
                <p>WHITE: That was not a major concern when I was there. They had a lot of diamond
                    wealth, but it wasn't always used very effectively. Botswana does - Botswana's
                    main source of income, I think, is diamonds. And they use it very well. They've
                    had three presidents, and they've all been very good presidents, I think. But in
                    other countries like Zaire and Angola, the fight over diamonds has led to a lot
                    of bloodshed.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, as a matter of fact, right now diamonds are the source of a lot of rebel
                    movements and very nasty violence in Sierra Leone and Congo, too.</p>
                <p>WHITE: The rebels and some foreign armies always want to get theihands on the

                <p>Q: You were there both in the Nixon and Carter times. Was there a change as far
                    as our economic interests in Africa between the late Nixon-Ford years and Carter
                    years?</p>
                <p>WHITE: I don't think there was any major change. Under Nixon at first we had the
                    detente talks with the Russians. I was in Morocco then. We had avoided contacts
                    before that. Then I was encouraged to talk to them and report on the talks.
                    Which I was glad to do, because I was so opposed to their system, I didn't see
                    how I could lose an argument with any of them.</p>
                <p>So I got to know the Soviets, the financial counselor in Morocco, but he could
                    barely speak English and very little French, so he was handicapped in carrying
                    out his job. He was trying to help them build a dam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '78 and you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after you retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: I have been active in Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired, where I am
                    on the Board of Governors, the Executive Committee, chairman of the Memorial
                    Committee, and member of the Program and Music Committees. I am also on the
                    board of the American Friends of the Czechoslovak Republic. We were successful
                    in getting a statue of the Czechoslovak president Tomas Masaryk on Massachusetts
                    Avenue this year. I worked on that.</p>
                <p>I also got involved in a series of books on Czechoslovakia in World War II. You
                    have these oral histories of the Foreign Service. I got the histories of the
                    people in Czechoslovakia that fought for a democratic country after the war, a
                    free and democratic country. So I got the memoirs of the war experiences of many
                    of these people, and I put them in three volumes, which I think is probably a
                    source book for their history. I also wrote some of the chapters. They don't
                    have anything else like it. They gave me a medal for it. And they're always
                    inviting me over to meet with the military people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What inspired you to do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WHITE: Because my father-in-law was one of the top generals in Czechoslovakia
                    under Benes. He was in London during World War II as President Benes's military
                    adviser and subsequently was sent to Czechoslovakia as it was being liberated to
                    serve as the Commander of the Liberated Territories.. He came over to the U.S.
                    in '48. So all I had to do was say I was General Hasal's son-in-law and I could
                    get anything I wanted. They would trust me to take care of their papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they ever repopulate the town of Lidice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Yes, but they put it in a different place. It's close by, but they left
                    the original site as a park. It is designated a peace park and they have
                    beautiful roses there. A very beautiful and moving place to visit.</p>
                <p>The Czechoslovak government in London sent some Czechs and Slovaks from England
                    to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, the brutal Reichs Protektor of occupied
                    Bohemia and Moravia. He was assassinated in May 1942. Lidice was completely
                    destroyed by the Germans and all men over 14 were shot in revenge for the
                    assassination. The women and children were sent separately to concentration
                    camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Hitler's governor for... what do you call it_?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: A “protectorate,” they call it - the Protectorate of Bohemiand
                    Moravia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a real nasty type.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: He was, yes. He assassinated many to inspire terror. The brave people who
                    were sent from England to assassinate him knew his route and when he passed one
                    of the two men waiting for him tried to fire his automatic weapon, but it
                    jammed, so the other one threw a grenade into this car. The car springs were
                    blown into him and he died about three days later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sound a little bit like the assassination of the
                        ArchdukFerdinand. Misfires, and_</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Actually, Heydrich deserved it; but the Archduke Ferdinand, was fairly
                    pro-Slav. He was more liberal-minded than Franz Josef. He was married to a
                    Czech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. On your wife's side of the family, how did they feel
                        abouthe break-up of Czechoslovakia into two parts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>WHITE: They didn't like it, because the Czechoslovakians counted for more in the
                    world than the Czechs and the Slovaks separately. In that period, Slovakia was
                    governed by a prime minister, Meciar, who had a very bad human rights record. He
                    was an ex-communist. We knew the last Czechoslovak ambassador here in '48; he
                    resigned when the communists took over, and he was a Slovak. So we've known a
                    lot of Slovaks.</p>
                <p>We went over there with our children in '98; President Havel invited us over. He
                    wanted to give posthumously my wife's father the Order of the White Lion, which
                    is their highest decoration. We were given a private tour of the beautiful
                    Prague Castle and then had champagne with President Havel and his staff. This
                    was the first time our son and daughter had visited the Czech Republic and it
                    was a wonderful introduction to the country of their mother's birth.</p>
                <p>We've been to Bratislava; we've been to Prague a number of times since the Velvet
                    Revolution, and I'm president of the Wilsonian club here. We have both Czechs
                    and Slovaks in it. We meet at the Woodrow Wilson house. We honor President
                    Woodrow Wilson and celebrate the independence of Czechoslovakia in 1918. Slovak
                    Ambassador Butora has agreed to come and speak about Rostislav Stefanik this
                    year. So we're friendly with both the Czechs and Slovaks. We go to both their
                    embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, Jack, I guess this is a good time to stop. I
                        thanyou very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WHITE: Well, okay. I've enjoyed it very much.</p>
