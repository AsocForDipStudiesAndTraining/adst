                <p>Subject: Movement of Peoples and Consular Affairs as Elements in American Foreign
                    Policy Operations</p>
                <p>Q: Mr. Recknagel, thank you very much for participating with us in this oral
                    history program. We feel very strongly—and scholars have confirmed this—that
                    these types of interviews give additional data to historians, social scientists,
                    and researchers that are extraordinarily useful as they do work in the field of
                    American foreign policy. The theme today is going to be movement of peoples, a
                    significant issue in foreign policy. I know you are an attorney by educational
                    background. I wonder if you could give us what it was in your educational
                    background that brought you into the foreign service and some indications as to
                    what were the themes in your career that brought you in contact with movement of
                    peoples as a significant issue in American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Thank you for that nice greeting. It is a pleasure to be here for me
                    also, and I hope that this will prove to be a useful interview.In response to
                    your question, I was really brought into the through my interest in political
                    science. I was a political science major in college at Cornell, where I took my
                    undergraduate work. I went into law really because of my interest in the Foreign
                    Service and because I was advised—and I think quite correctly—that law is an
                    excellent background, particularly for anyone wanting to be a political officer
                    in the Foreign Service, which I was. Insofar as the topic today, my background
                    does go back to my early years in the Foreign Service. I entered the Foreign
                    Service in 1947, and my first post was Sofia, Bulgaria. When I came back from
                    there, I was on the Bulgarian desk in the Department and later on the Yugoslav
                    desk. It was particularly in the latter position that I became involved in the
                    question of refugee movements in Europe, because we had many problems at that
                    time stemming from the large number of Yugoslav refugees, particularly in Italy,
                    but elsewhere in Western Europe, the demands of the Yugoslav Government, the
                    Tito Government, with respect to those refugees, the whole question of the care
                    and rights of those refugees. I was more or less tangentially involved, but I
                    worked very closely with our refugee people in the Department at that time, such
                    as George Warren and Larry Dawson. I was also involved in the first human rights
                    presentation that the United States made in the United Nations, charging human
                    rights violations and peace treaty violations against Bulgaria, Romania, and
                    Hungary. These violations, of course, also had a great deal to do with the
                    situation that created refugees in the post-war period, because we had not only
                    those who were created by the war itself, but also by the communist takeover of
                    the curtain countries of Eastern Europe. In my assignment in Tel Aviv, when I
                    was there, I was primarily engaged in obtaining political and human right
                    information from people who were coming out from behind the curtain, but
                    certainly, many of those Jews who were coming out from behind the curtain and
                    settling in Israel were refugees, and the problems of caring for those people
                    also was something with which I was tangentially concerned.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Actually, for a relatively short time. We were, as you recall, in
                    fact, thrown out of Bulgaria. We suspended relations with them, and they gave us
                    three days to get out. I was assigned to Tel Aviv immediately after that. We
                    were sent to Rome, and then I spent about only a little more than half a year in
                    Tel Aviv before I was called back to the Department and took over as Bulgarian
                    desk officer. That was 1950. After that, I really did not have anything to do
                    particularly with refugees in any special sense until I took over as Senior
                    Deputy Administrator in the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs in 1973.
                    Primarily, in S.C.A., refugees concerned us to the extent that refugee
                    situations and policies impinged upon the whole question of movement of persons,
                    in which the consular function of the Department is involved. Although at the
                    end of that tour, I was very closely involved in the first part of the problem
                    of handling the tremendous refugee outpouring from Vietnam, resulting from the
                    end of the war and surrender to the North in that country. Finally, I retired
                    from the Department in 1975, but I came back in 1977. For the following nine
                    years, off and on—mostly on- -I was retained as a consultant in asylum affairs
                    and worked exclusively in asylum affairs during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. We'll be coming back to all of
                        these in detail.Before we get into any specific questions, do you have any
                        general comment you want to make about the whole issue that can set the
                        stage for specific discussions on specific topics and issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Only that I will try to focus on things which are not readily
                    available to anybody who wishes to look into the history of the United States'
                    involvement in refugee affairs and to talk about some of those aspects which are
                    personal to my experience or which possibly I can elucidate a little bit
                    more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's precisely what we want. I notice in your career
                        that you were, as you said, the Senior Deputy Administrator of the Bureau of
                        Security and Consular Affairs from 1973 to 1975. If I remember correctly,
                        the administrator at that time was Barbara Watson. Then you may have had
                        either a short overlap with Leonard Walentynowicz, who succeeded her, or, at
                        any rate, you were possibly, shall we say, in at the creation of the
                        nomination. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about who those two
                        people were and how or on what basis they were chosen for that position,
                        their professional and political qualifications, and elements having to do
                        with why people like that were chosen for jobs like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Barbara Watson was the administrator when I came in. She already had
                    been administrator for some time. Her background and the reasons for her being
                    in that position are interesting. Actually, she was Jamaican in origin, born an
                    American citizen, but, nevertheless, her family was, and a good part of it still
                    is, Jamaican. Her father was a distinguished judge in New York. Unfortunately,
                    Barbara is dead; she died several years ago. She was black and was the first
                    black woman to be appointed to a senior position in the Department of State.
                    Indeed, there weren't even very many women at the time in as senior a position
                    as she when she was appointed. She was a lawyer by training, a graduate of
                    Barnard College, and had practiced law particularly in the social services area
                    in New York, if I recall correctly. She came down to Washington, and she was a
                    Democrat. I don't know the background of her initial appointment to the State
                    Department, but she initially was appointed to a position as an assistant to
                    Bill Crockett, who was at that time the Deputy Under Secretary for Management in
                    the Department. There was a major problem at that time in SCA [Bureau of
                    Security and Consular Affairs] which stemmed from the fact that one Frances
                    Knight, who was the head of the passport office, a lady extremely well wired
                    politically, was acting in a manner totally independent of the Department,
                    refusing to conform even to the most minimal requirements of bureaucratic
                    cooperation, in effect, running the passport office as an independent fiefdom.
                    Nobody in the Department back in the mid-Sixties really knew quite how to handle
                    Frances Knight. As I say, she was well wired politically. I can underline that
                    by saying that her chief support was Senator Humphrey on the Hill. She was very
                    well connected on the Republican side as well [and on the Republican side it was
                    Senator Jacob Javits.] That gives some idea of the level at which she was being
                    supported. Bill Crockett conceived the idea that if he could put a very able,
                    forceful, as he perceived it, black lady in the position of Administrator of
                    Security and Consular Affairs, it would be very difficult for Frances Knight not
                    to cooperate with this woman, that all of the odds really would be in favor of
                    the senior black lady, emphasizing the fact that both as a lady and as a black,
                    she was going to be given special attention and care, if you will, particularly
                    in the mid-Sixties. So Barbara was put in for that reason. I don't mean to say
                    by that that she was not an able person, but Barbara would have been the first
                    to say that, as of that time, she had no background in consular affairs at all,
                    but because she was an able and conscientious person, she was a very active
                    student of consular affairs from the beginning. I might say that by the time I
                    became her deputy in 1973, I found her to be a very knowledgeable and competent
                    head of the Bureau, which in itself was very pleasing. The purpose, however, for
                    which she was originally assigned was not achieved. As able as Barbara was, she
                    could not handle Frances Knight. By the time I got there, they had simply
                    reached a standoff, and very, very little was being accomplished at all in terms
                    of getting Frances Knight to cooperate in any way with the Department. She would
                    undertake budgetary adventures of her own, research projects of her own, as I
                    will explain in more detail later. So that was Barbara and her background, and
                    that's why she was there. Barbara was a Democrat, but because she was black and
                    a lady and doing an excellent job, she was not touched by the Nixon
                    Administration in the first four years. She was left right there and did as well
                    as expected, which was very well indeed. In his 1972 campaign for re-election,
                    Nixon apparently had depended a great deal on the Polish vote in the
                    northeastern area. People who might otherwise have been expected to go
                    Democratic voted in substantial numbers for him. One Leonard Walentynowicz, who
                    was a police lawyer in Buffalo, New York, had been very active for Nixon in the
                    Polish community. A graduate of Buffalo Law School, I believe, his entire
                    practice revolved around the police courts and police methodology. Much of his
                    previous experience had been teaching aspects of law to the police in Buffalo,
                    which the police needed in their work. But he had been also politically very
                    active and had gotten the Polish vote in Buffalo. So to thank him for his work,
                    the Nixon White House wanted to find him a job, the typical political thing.
                    They felt that, particularly with his Polish background and his other activity,
                    which was in the Polish-American community, that something in the immigration
                    field would be suitable—a mistake, by the way, which I think politicians often
                    make. But nevertheless, this was the case. They looked around and nothing was
                    available in INS, and here was something in the Department. This is the
                    background of Walentynowicz's nomination. He was smart enough to know that he
                    didn't have much background in consular work, and he didn't initially push his
                    desire to move into the job until he had a chance to wind up his affairs in
                    Buffalo and to train himself a little bit in consular affairs. It was almost a
                    year after Nixon took office the second time that Walentynowicz came down to
                    Washington. In the meantime, there had been a back-and-forth between him and
                    Barbara Watson, who did not want to give up her job. She particularly didn't
                    want to give it up to a man like Walentynowicz. There's a whole story there
                    which I may get into if you find it interesting. He did take over, finally, at
                    the beginning of 1975. Barbara left several months before that. I really was
                    with him only for a period of four months, so I can't say very much about him
                    beyond that.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an interesting stage-setter for the politics of
                        consular appointments in the Department of State.Now I think it would be
                        good to move along to some of the issues that you were involved in during
                        your incumbency as senior deputy administrator. One that comes to mind
                        almost immediately is consular relations with our two neighbors, the
                        Canadians to the north and the Mexicans to the south. I wonder if you could
                        talk a bit about some of the elements there, what kinds of problems there
                        were, and what were the underlying realities of how work on these was
                        done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Let me give you a little background before I come to the specific
                    response to that question. First you have to understand the duties of the deputy
                    administrator or the duties of a deputy in almost any such position, which is
                    really running the Bureau, leaving the head of the Bureau free to do those
                    things in which he or she is particularly competent or which involve basic
                    policy considerations and things of that sort, and not worrying about the
                    nitty-gritty of day-to-day operations. My view of all things, which I will
                    discuss now, is that of somebody who is concerned with keeping things going on a
                    day-to-day basis and only partially involved in the more high- level aspects.
                    Relations with Canada at the time I was there really did not involve any serious
                    problems, so I really cannot add anything of great interest with regard to
                    Canada.Mexico was another matter. The drug problem back in those days was
                    growing by leaps and bounds, as it has continued to do ever since. Drug
                    smugglers were a good deal less sophisticated then than they have become now.
                    Colombia was then, as now, the primary source for drugs coming into the United
                    States. One of the preferred means of getting those drugs into this country was
                    to use young people who were vacationing or studying in Colombia or coming back
                    through Colombia on their return to the United States, to get them to carry
                    small amounts but, nevertheless, very valuable amounts of drugs into the United
                    States with them. Initially, this worked quite well for the drug smugglers,
                    because these kids simply weren't suspected. Later, after a few of them were
                    discovered, our Drug Enforcement Agency people began to look into it and
                    realized that this was a very major operation. These kids were being paid well
                    in their terms, but nothing in terms of what the profit was for the drug dealer.
                    As you may recall, “mules” was the term that was used for them. Many of them
                    came through Mexico City. The place to change planes, or merely where the planes
                    stopped coming back from Bogota was very often Mexico City. Once it was known
                    that there was considerable traffic of this sort going on, the question arose of
                    how were we going to get at these people. The first thing was that these
                    American citizens contended that when they were in the transit lounge they were
                    immune from arrest by the local authorities. That, of course, has been fully
                    resolved since, but it was not fully resolved at that time. Since then, it has
                    been clearly established that there is no question that an airport transit
                    lounge is part of the national territory of the country on which it is located,
                    and a criminal can certainly be arrested in the transit lounge.</p>

                        want to call it that, not only has implications for narcotics smuggling, but
                        has implications for such things as terrorism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: I should think very much so. Happily, we didn't have the terrorist
                    problem in those days as it exists today. As soon as this decision was made, the
                    Mexican police, with the full cooperation of our own DEA [Drug Enforcement
                    Administration] people, moved in on these “mules,” and there was quite a large
                    number—80, 90, or more—arrests of these American kids in transit through Mexico.
                    They were carrying significant amounts of drugs— strong drugs, heroin, cocaine,
                    and so forth—and were, of course, guilty under Mexican law of a very serious
                    crime, just as under our own law. The problem that we got involved in was a very
                    typical consular problem. They were arrested, they were thrown into the jug, and
                    then the question was: Were they really getting the treatment that we felt that
                    they deserved as American citizens, or were they being mistreated, denied basic
                    rights, and so forth? The problems in dealing with these people were really
                    traditional consular protection problems. The thing which makes it somewhat
                    interesting, however, and worth noting is that it became a very real issue on
                    the Hill. Certain congressmen, most notably one congressman, Fortney H. “Pete”
                    Stark of California, championed these people and demanded something which was a
                    very new concept. He argued that although they were arrested in Mexico and were
                    guilty of crimes under Mexican law, they shouldn't be made to serve their
                    sentences there. They were nice, clean-cut American kids, he contended, and
                    should be allowed to come back to the United States, serve their Mexican
                    sentences here, and under conditions which we would consider humane. Stark, at
                    least, did not consider the conditions in the Mexican prisons very humane. As
                    far as I know, this was the first time such a concept had been broached. We
                    brought into it also some Americans who were in Turkish jails, also on charges
                    of drug smuggling, also convicted in that country. Although the matter was not
                    resolved more than partially during my time in SCA, it was subsequently resolved
                    both in the case of these kids in the Mexican jails and in the case of at least
                    one of the Americans in Turkey. The decision was made that they could come back
                    here. This was the point at issue: Could our American courts recognize a
                    conviction in a foreign country? Could we put an American citizen in prison to
                    serve a sentence which he had been given in a foreign court under foreign law?
                    There was the question, first of all, whether we could even do this, that an
                    American citizen should be subjected to this. Secondly, how would you do it? In
                    other words, would there have to be a court order here, or how could it be
                    handled? Finally, would we accept the same sentence? Would we have a new trial
                    here? The decision was made that, basically, yes, if the person agreed that he
                    would serve the sentence here, or that he would at least go into a period of
                    probation equivalent to that in which his sentence would have required him to
                    remain in jail in the foreign country, and if the foreign country would agree to
                    release him on those terms, then we would take him back here and the states and
                    local authorities would provide the necessary supervision. How this has worked
                    out, I cannot answer. I simply know this was the point that we reached when I
                    left SCA. Indeed, through your own experiences, you may know cases subsequent.
                    But that was the point that we reached there. It was very interesting.</p>

                        negotiating with the Mexicans and the Turks and other countries where this
                        issue came up, was how to persuade the foreign governments to accept what
                        really was a derogation of their own sovereignty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is Mexico less sovereign than the United States? Why
                        is Turkey less sovereign than the United States? Harmonizing this strong
                        political requirement that political forces in the United States were
                        placing on our government with the pride and the sensitivity of some of
                        these foreign governments, that they are just as sovereign as we are, I know
                        was the major preoccupation. I do not know how that was done either, but it
                        clearly was complicated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: That's certainly right. I think, basically, it was achieved in the
                    case of Mexico because, in fact, the Mexicans were absolutely sick and tired of
                    this problem, because we were constantly beating on them because of the
                    pressures that were put on us by people like Stark and others. We were
                    constantly beating on the Mexicans about the treatment that they were meting out
                    to these people. On the one hand, we wanted them to arrest them, we wanted them
                    to enforce the laws, and then they would get them in prison, and we were
                    constantly raising Cain with them about the way they were treating them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These people like Stark and others on the Hill or
                        elsewhere who were taking the side of these young people, were they ever
                        prepared to discuss with you or address the issue of the whole concept of
                        drug control, drug enforcement, or did they simply try to keep themselves
                        separate from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: To my mind—and I'm a little bit prejudiced against Stark; I found him
                    particularly annoying and the way they were playing it to be annoying—they made
                    it an emotional issue. They would get some kid who had been arrested, an
                    attractive, young college girl, and they'd get her family and these weeping
                    letters that she would write to the family, and the family imploring us to do
                    something to save their daughter, to bring her back. It was played much too much
                    on that basis, to my mind, and I believe that I can say accurately that our own
                    drug enforcement people within the Department, with whom I was dealing at that
                    time, particularly Sheldon Vance, who was the Assistant to the Secretary on Drug
                    Enforcement Problems, felt very much the same way, that they were detracting
                    from, rather than contributing to, the basic effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. In what way and in what form did
                        your involvement in congressional relations and press relations take place?
                        We've touched a little bit on that with this issue, but it seems to me a
                        natural follow-on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Right. Congressional relations was a very important part of the job in
                    S.C.A. By the time I came into the job, Barbara had pretty much had her fill of
                    the glory of playing around with congressmen, so she really largely left routine
                    congressional relations to me and to my fellow deputy, Fred Smith. Fred was our
                    specific legal expert and always a much greater expert on consular legal affairs
                    than I. I had the balance of it, which was the overall relations problem,
                    budgetary dealings, and things like that. The important thing to know is that
                    the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Naturalization, and
                    International Law has a direct oversight responsibility under the law, under the
                    INA, over the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, as it was then, and the
                    Bureau of Consular Affairs, as it is now. They took this oversight
                    responsibility very seriously, and still do, I'm sure. Every major move that we
                    made we had to first go up on the Hill and discuss with them. Take a relatively
                    simple thing, like amendment of the transit- without-visa regulations, or the
                    question of placing in passports the fact that travel to certain nations was
                    forbidden. All of these things had to be taken up on the Hill, had to be
                    discussed with them, and should the subcommittee see fit, be the subject of an
                    actual hearing. In general, our hearings were limited to two subjects. The
                    budget went the same every year, the same old thing: On the one hand, “Why do
                    you need all these consular posts? Why do you need so many consular officers?”
                    And on the other hand, “Why are you doing such a lousy job protecting American
                    citizens? I have these constituents who have written to me and told me this. How
                    are you training your people? Are you really sending out people who are
                    competent?” Each year we would go up to the Hill and spend a day or more with
                    them on that.The other and more significant problem which also annually resulted
                    in hearings on the Hill was the question of the illegal alien problem. Today
                    this has become a very major issue, but it was surely no small issue at that
                    time, although the figures that we used then would perhaps seem small in
                    comparison to those that are used today in terms of the dimension of the
                    problem. I suppose that we should go back and talk about illegal aliens and the
                    efforts made by Congressman Peter Rodino beginning possibly earlier but, to my
                    knowledge, at least as early as 1971, to introduce a bill which would provide
                    most specifically some sort of sanction on American employers employing illegal
                    aliens and which would include provisions for the use of illegal aliens, most
                    particularly Mexicans in our vegetable-growing fields in California. These were
                    the two primary things. Each year this bill would be introduced; each year it
                    would be passed by the subcommittee and passed pretty much without difficulty by
                    the House, which is rather interesting; each year absolutely nothing was done by
                    the Senate. The reason nothing was done by the Senate was one Senator Eastland
                    of Mississippi, who was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose
                    subcommittee concerned itself equally with these problems. Senator Eastland
                    would not even go to the point of having hearings on this subject. The reason is
                    very simple: Senator Eastland employed large numbers of illegal aliens on his
                    rather extensive lands in Mississippi, and he was not remotely interested in
                    having any restrictions placed on the use of these people. I am not just making
                    this charge out of thin air; everybody knew it to be the case, and everybody
                    knows what sort of a curmudgeon Senator Eastland was. The thing that we all
                    thought—this is parenthetical—was that later, when Eastland disappeared from the
                    scene and Senator Kennedy became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the late
                    Seventies, after I left, that this would change. It has not really changed.
                    There are still many problems, but at least they do now hold hearings, I
                    understand. We would go up there, together with counterparts from INS
                    [Immigration and Naturalization Service], and we would discuss all aspects of
                    illegal alien movement in the country, our concern being what we were able to do
                    on the consular side to control the movement of aliens in the United States,
                    INS's concern being what it could do to control illegal aliens crossing the
                    border. I think this is a good place for me to introduce something which is
                    parallel to this. This is the interest which I think really first began to
                    develop in any serious proportions while I was at S.C.A. in the use of data
                    control methods to control the movement of aliens in the country and to control
                    aliens through proper documentation. It tied in very directly with this. It
                    occurred to us, all of the people concerned with the problem about this time,
                    that technology was reaching the point that it would be possible to control
                    people and particularly our records of aliens through the use of computers. For
                    example, you can issue some sort of a computerized visa, which would be readable
                    by a computer at the point of entry in New York. When somebody came in with this
                    visa, INS could run it through the computer in New York right at the point of
                    entry, and immediately it would flash on the screen whether this man was on the
                    lookout list or anything of that sort, or whether, indeed, the consular officer
                    who had issued the visa had some little thing that he wanted to warn INS about.
                    It's that last point that caused all the problem, but let me come back to that
                    in a moment, because the other thing that caused a problem was what kind of
                    computerization we were going to have and what kind of data processing. At that
                    time, as still today, there were a number of different companies in the field, a
                    number of different consulting concerns, that were coming up with various types
                    of questions of how to use computers for all sorts of things, from credit cards
                    to record keeping in large companies. As we discussed this, we felt that the
                    first thing you've got to do— and this was discussed widely in the Department—is
                    to turn to a consulting firm to tell you just what is possible and what could be
                    done. After all, none of us had any idea what could be done with a computer. INS
                    was doing exactly the same thing at this time. I might say, by the way, so was
                    Frances Knight, independently, in the passport office.The Department retained a
                    firm connected with MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. Somewhere there
                    was a total breakdown, because, at the same time we were doing this, INS
                    retained a totally different firm. I forget the name of the firm. What Frances
                    Knight was doing was something independent, anyway, from what we're talking
                    about on illegal aliens. When we found out about this, one of the first things
                    we wanted to do was to see if we couldn't at least get these firms together and
                    get them to agree so that when they came up with some suggestions, you'd have a
                    system which was compatible both to INS's needs and to the Department's needs,
                    to the consular service's needs. At that time, the Commissioner of INS was
                    General Chapman, a Marine officer, who was a fine gentleman, but he was a
                    Marine. He made up his mind, by God, he was going to hold it forever. He
                    absolutely was not amenable to any suggestion from the Department. His
                    suggestion was, “If you don't like what we're doing, why don't you get the same
                    people to do the job for you?” It was an unfortunate thing, and it kind of cast
                    a pall over all the efforts that were made throughout most of the time that I
                    was in S.C.A., the latter part, anyway. We had a group of people in the visa
                    office who were concerned just with this. Shortly before I left, I arranged for
                    a new deputy in the visa office whose whole background was in this field, with
                    the idea that they would move on into it. Unfortunately, an awful lot of ideas
                    came up, an awful lot of useful thoughts, and we certainly proved it would be
                    feasible, but, in my time there, we never got beyond that point. I believe I am
                    correct in saying that to this day there is no coordinated computerized control
                    between INS and the Department, nor, indeed, do we have machine-readable visas,
                    to the best of my knowledge. I think you can tell whether they're false or not,
                    but I don't think you can read any information.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you are right. I think we should note for the
                        record that we're talking now in August 1986. So we're talking 11, 12, 13
                        years after you were in at the beginning of this effort. You also said that
                        there was a big excitement about the question of what kinds of information
                        would be placed in the system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: This is very, very important. Immediately we got into this question of
                    what computerized information you could put on the visa. After all, you can put
                    on a card, like a credit card or a license, all kinds of information on that
                    little black strip which appears on the card. The person who holds the card
                    doesn't have an idea what it says in that black strip. It may say, “This man is
                    a crook. Notify the police immediately if he presents this card to you.” You
                    have no idea. You can see what the civil liberties people are going to do with
                    this. They'd say, “You can't do this. Here you have all kinds of information
                    about this alien, for example, placed on his visa, which he isn't even going to
                    know about. You just can't do this.”We said, “This guy isn't an American
                    citizen. You're not worrying about his rights as you might those of an American
                    citizen.” They said, “It doesn't matter.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, they were proposing, if you will, to
                        extend the protection of the Constitution of the United States to anyone who
                        walked into any U.S. Government office, even outside the United States,
                        before he even got into this country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Absolutely. Strangely enough, there was just enough appeal. You know
                    this also from asylum matters, that you get somewhat the same approach that an
                    alien somehow is entitled to American constitutional protection. At that time,
                    the credit card people were involved in exactly the same problem, so it extended
                    far beyond just the question of visas or some type of control card for aliens in
                    this country. They, I think, have since resolved it, because, as we all know,
                    credit cards today in 1986 do have little black strips, they do run them through
                    machines, they do read things that we don't know what they are. But at that
                    time, they were not allowed to. Much less was there a feeling that the
                    government should do anything of that sort.I might say one other thing in
                    connection with that. At the same time that this was going on, we were having a
                    number of hearings. We weren't involved in them directly, but there were
                    hearings on the Hill and meetings by groups, in which Frances Knight was very,
                    very prominent, looking toward the possibility of a national identification
                    card. The problems of a national identification card would be enormous. You can
                    imagine what's involved in keeping records on 230 million people, or whatever we
                    have. Again, this was one aspect of the national identification card argument
                    also: what is going to be on these cards. Is everybody going to have a card
                    that's going to have secret information that he doesn't know about? This was
                    constitutional protection to American citizens, if you will. That was as far as
                    it got during my period, which is all that I can speak authoritatively on,
                    except I will say, again, that it was symptomatic of the problems that we had in
                    the Bureau that this effort being carried on by the passport office with an
                    entirely independent research firm, entirely independent of any controls that we
                    were able to bring to bear. Although there were many, many battles fought over
                    that, this did continue during the time I was there.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. One of the things that comes to mind
                        as one thinks about the position that you occupied was the whole idea of
                        consular work as a career in the Foreign Service. Anyone who knows anything
                        about foreign affairs knows that a distinction is always made between
                        “substantive” and “non-substantive,” the former being obviously a desirable
                        kind of assignment, the latter being not a desirable kind of assignment.
                        Yet, at the same time, it is also true that, as movement of peoples and
                        consular problems have come more and more in the forefront of intense
                        foreign policy concerns of the government, the distinction is blurry. Then
                        there's also the problem of how do you get good people to occupy responsible
                        positions on the consular side. My assumption is that you were concerned
                        with this. In what ways were you involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: I was very concerned with this. First of all, I have to give a bow in
                    the direction of Barbara Watson on this question. Barbara, as I said, was an
                    extremely conscientious administrator of the Bureau, and, from the beginning,
                    she devoted a great deal of her time in trying to build up the prestige of the
                    consular career, if you will, within the Foreign Service, and to try to make the
                    career a more attractive one. I was very much involved in it. As a matter of
                    fact, before coming to SCA, I was head of the Senior Officer Division in
                    Personnel in the Department and was very closely involved in some of the senior
                    consular assignment problems that came up during my tenure in that job. That's
                    how I really first got to know Barbara and first got to work with her. That was
                    really the background for her asking for me for that job as her deputy. So with
                    this background, with my interest in personnel and my interest obviously
                    stemming from my assignment in SCA, I spent a great deal of time also on the
                    career thing. The consular career is a very difficult problem in the Foreign
                    Service. You are quite right when you say that there is, first of all, this
                    traditional distinction always that's made there, which anybody in consular work
                    is going to be immediately conscious of. So one of the things you've got to do
                    is try to break down the reasons for this distinction. The only way you can
                    really do that is by cross-assignment, by giving people doing consular work
                    assignments outside of consular work, and giving people outside of it consular
                    assignments. The first thing you have to be sure of is that whoever you are
                    getting in the Foreign Service is somebody who is competent right across the
                    board. Therefore, what you don't want to do, as some people have been inclined
                    in the past, is to say, “This guy is fine. He can do a job as an admin officer,
                    but he could never be a political officer.” You cannot recruit people into the
                    Service that way. Across the board, you've got to have people who are competent
                    as Foreign Service officers and capable of doing a job in any of the four
                    specialties. Only if you do that can you have cross-cultivation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that basically what you're doing is you are
                        questioning what could be called the cone system of recruitment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Very much so. I've always been opposed to the cone system of
                    recruitment. Somewhere buried in the files of the Department are memoranda that
                    I have written on this subject. I've always thought the cone system was wrong.
                    I've always thought it was far better in the old days—I mean really the old
                    days—when every new officer coming in, his first job when he would go out to the
                    field would be consular. In the days before World War II, they were always sent
                    to Canadian posts. There were very few people involved, and they got their feet
                    wet dealing with the foreign public, doing consular work and learning consular
                    work. The advantage of this is that low-level consular work, routine visa
                    issuing, and this sort of thing, is dull work, and it's not very exciting work.
                    Somebody comes in with big ideas about how he's ambassadorial material and
                    thinking of the big picture, and so forth, and he's put in a consular job and
                    finds it dull, uninteresting, and doesn't see the great rewards. He's not making
                    vast foreign policy decisions. But he knows this officer, so he does the best
                    job he can, hoping for better things when he gets promoted. If you have a
                    situation where some people are in those jobs and some people are not in those
                    jobs, you've really got problems. You've got the guys down here in the consular
                    section drudging away, and you know, as well as I, what it's like in these visa
                    mills—it's absolutely miserable. Here you've got some other guy who probably
                    isn't doing all that important work, but he's up on the sixth floor in the
                    political section. He comes down, looks at his buddy down there, and smiles in a
                    superior way. This does no good for anybody's morale, and it certainly does no
                    good for the understanding of the guy with a slightly bigger head because he's
                    doing political work. I felt that if you label people, as the cone system does,
                    if you, from the beginning, subject one guy to a type of work which is drudgery
                    and not very glamorous, while the other guy is able to do work which he is told
                    is glamorous, even though it may not be very glamorous, you're just creating
                    real morale problems in the beginning. You've got to make these people feel that
                    they are interchangeable. It is very, very hard. There's a lot of prejudice in
                    the Foreign Service too, if you advance these ideas, because there are a lot of
                    people who really believe absolutely, “You've got a guy doing admin or a
                    consular job, they can't do a job like I'm doing in political work.” That was
                    one of the big things that we tried very hard to break down. I spent a great
                    deal of my time, because of the background I had in personnel, trying to do two
                    things: first of all, to see that in the very junior years that everybody got
                    his turn in consular work, and, equally, that everybody got his turn in other
                    disciplines of the Foreign Service, so when they came up to the so- called
                    junior threshold, you would look at an entire officer. You wouldn't look at a
                    guy who had been a great man in a visa mill or a guy who had been a good
                    assistant in the ambassador's office; you'd look at a guy who had some record
                    across the board with a minimum of three assignments. Partially we succeeded. I
                    think we made considerable progress. What we did have during all of that period,
                    some of which I really did not like, and I think they've gotten away from it
                    now, but I don't know, you selected your discipline when you took your written
                    exam. I think we've gotten away from that. You may know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure. I think, to a certain extent, you compete
                        for a discipline, compete for a cone. It is, as you say, very controversial
                        for the very reasons that you have indicated.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Let me add one thing about why I feel so strongly about this, and I do
                    feel strongly about it. I don't know if I made all that much of a contribution
                    to break it down. We did try. I know in my own experience that, actually, in my
                    entire career up until the time I was assigned as DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission],
                    I really never had any consular or admin exposure. I did political work. When I
                    took over as DCM, particularly because I landed at a post where I spent the
                    first year as charg�, I was very conscious of the fact that I didn't know what
                    they were doing in these sections, and I was really not able to do the job that
                    I should be able to do. I had to kind of wing it on consular questions. So I
                    felt this was no way. If you're going to have a man at the top, just like any
                    business, the guy should know across the board. And if you're going to make a
                    man feel that he really has a career and can aspire to the best that career has
                    to offer, you've got to have him qualified across the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've teased me through this conversation with all of
                        these descriptions of Frances Knight and her independent satrapy. I know
                        that she did leave, and I know that she did leave while Barbara Watson was
                        there. Can you give any more information about what ultimately happened, as
                        far as you can tell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: You mention Dumas Malone and you mention Jefferson. If you think of
                    Jefferson and Adams on July 4, 1828, when they both died, that each wanted to
                    know whether the other had died, that was Barbara and Frances. They truly grew
                    to hate each other; there is no question they really hated each other. The most
                    unpleasant part of my job was that I had to deal with Frances Knight. Barbara
                    would not speak to her. She would communicate with her only in the form of
                    memoranda of instruction, which Frances would tear up and then proceed to throw
                    them in the wastebasket. If she replied, she would reply only to the deputy
                    under secretary and with some kind of a scathing denunciation of Barbara, very,
                    very personal. It was very unpleasant. Barbara was a lady; she never indulged in
                    anything like that. Frances indulged in the most vitriolic personal abuse in her
                    memoranda. It was most unpleasant.My job was to try to somehow bring the
                    passport division within the bureaucratic control, or at least the bureaucratic
                    operation of SCA. I tried, first of all, to work out pleasant relations with
                    Frances Knight. I got along with her personally adequately. She disliked me
                    heartily because I worked for Barbara, but at least when I went over to see her,
                    I would be allowed to see her. You've got to remember I was supposed to be her
                    superior, which, of course, was a laugh. She was totally uncooperative. She
                    would absolutely say nothing. She would absolutely agree to nothing. This was a
                    day in, day out battle all the time I was there. Finally, by using the device of
                    getting the Deputy Under Secretary for Management into it, we did get her to
                    agree to send representatives to the weekly staff meeting which I chaired. She
                    would send the lowest, most ill- informed people she could get away with; they
                    were told to say nothing; they would say nothing. This was all duly reported.
                    Nobody knew what to do with Frances Knight because they couldn't remove her.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of her political clout?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Absolutely. She had reached retirement age and refused to leave. I
                    forget whether she was 65 or 70—retirement age, anyway. This was raised on the
                    Hill by Dean Brown, who, in the latter part of my time there was the Deputy
                    Under Secretary for Management. But nobody really knew how to handle her. I did
                    keep up the forms; at least, throughout all the time I was there. I did go over
                    to meetings that she would have in pursuit of her interest in coming up with a
                    new and smaller passport, which is the one we have now. It took some years after
                    that to finally come up with it. We never really got her to cooperate in any
                    meaningful way.When Walentynowicz came in, Walentynowicz considered himself a
                    great personality and very personable, both, and he felt that he could charm an
                    Eskimo into buying an icebox. He took the line, “Few people are like Frances,
                    and, besides, Frances is a good Republican. You just don't know how to handle
                    her.” It really didn't work. The only thing was that Frances's husband, who is a
                    very prominent man in the aviation publishing field, apparently was beginning to
                    wind up some of his activities, and they were looking to a more retired life.
                    Frances was under constant pressure to retire. Humphrey had died by that time.
                    The power that she had on the Hill was waning. My own opinion was that she just
                    decided she didn't want to keep up the fight. Walentynowicz got nowhere with her
                    as long as she was there, beyond one thing I have to give him credit for—he did
                    get her over to one SCA Bureau meeting in the Department. One. One time, which
                    was a tremendous achievement, I suppose, when one really looks at it. That was
                    it. It was a disagreeable time, and I must say it was a very happy day, in my
                    mind, for the Passport Division when that lady left, not that she was not
                    competent. She was very competent, but she was so intractable and so
                    difficult.</p>

                        of your tenure was the establishment of a Vietnamese refugee program. I do
                        not know how much of your time was spent in dealing with that. I know you
                        had a tour in Vietnam, so you had, if you will, some political background on
                        the subject that perhaps other people in the Bureau did not have. As far as
                        you know, at least at the time it began, was there unanimity in the
                        government about the establishment of such a program? If not, why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: As you say, correctly, I was involved only in the beginning of this,
                    because I left the Bureau at the end of April 1975. The whole problem, just as
                    everything else involved in the collapse in Vietnam, exploded on the Department
                    literally almost overnight. We had not really done any advance work in
                    contingency planning of the sort that we should have done for a problem of this
                    magnitude. I think that the ORM [Office of Refugees and Migration], which was
                    primarily concerned with such refugee problems, had done a certain amount, but
                    ORM was not a very strong organization in those days, and they, too, were
                    certainly caught very much off base by this. First of all, we had problems even
                    knowing what the magnitude of the refugee problem would be, because Ambassador
                    Graham Martin, throughout this whole period, as you know, really refused to
                    accept the fact that there was going to be a mass refugee problem, indeed, that
                    there was going to be an American evacuation, surrender, or anything else. In
                    the early days of this thing, when most of us realized that it was going to
                    happen, it was very difficult, really, to get the task force which was set up to
                    deal with this, to focus on the problem. There was very, very serious
                    disagreement as to what the magnitude of the problem might be. There were those
                    of us, like myself, who felt that it would be absolutely enormous. I think I can
                    say that those who served in Vietnam and really believed that this was going to
                    be what it actually did turn out to be, realized that there would be many, many
                    thousands of Vietnamese seeking to flee their country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were discussing the problem of getting the Department
                        to agree on what the magnitude of the Vietnam refugee flow would be.
                        Obviously, that had to be resolved before anyone could decide what to
                        do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Exactly. You have to realize that it was a very emotional issue also
                    at the time, because to admit that there would be a million or more Vietnamese
                    fleeing was really to admit our own total defeat. There were a lot of people
                    who, for emotional reasons also, did not want to face up to it. This was very
                    strongly exemplified right in our own Bureau. Walentynowicz was violently
                    opposed to anything except the most minimal refugee program for Vietnamese. I
                    never really fully understood his thinking on this, particularly since he was a
                    man who developed so much of his own career based on his close ties with the
                    Polish immigrant community. You would have thought it might be different, that
                    he would have more sympathy for refugees. He had a great ally in the INS
                    commissioner, General Chapman. I suppose it's not unfair to say that he really
                    didn't want all those “gooks” over here. That was a bit of the attitude that he
                    had. It became exceedingly difficult with these two people, who were rather
                    primary in this area, to do any planning. The people in the task force were
                    really not interested in coming to grips with figures which we, at the next
                    level down, were working up, which projected possibly as many as a million
                    refugees. They simply were not going to accept that at that stage of the game.
                    At the time that I left, while this thing was still up in the air, they were
                    just beginning, and the first top-level people were being brought out in the air
                    lifts. The boat people, the people who fled independently had not really started
                    yet to develop.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it your impression that the decision to institute a
                        Vietnamese refugee program, which ultimately assumed rather large
                        dimensions, was taken almost in spite of the opposition of Walentynowicz and
                        Chapman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: I would say that it was simply a question of the fact that when it
                    really came down to the crunch, when it was evident that this problem was going
                    to be of enormous magnitude, that people with objections such as theirs simply
                    had to be shunted aside. The problem had to be dealt with; it was there. So my
                    impression is that it was just an obstructionist thing, and it was certainly
                    very obstructionist at the beginning. Even the task force itself found it
                    difficult to accede to our projections of the ultimate magnitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could it be said that the obstructionism that was taken in
                        coming to grips with the problem meant that the obstructionists ultimately
                        took themselves out of play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: It wouldn't be fair for me to answer that, because I was out of it at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With regard to the role of the administrator, whoever the
                        administrator was—and it may have varied from Barbara Watson to Len
                        Walentynowicz—how did the political line actually flow from the White House
                        to the administrator? Do you have any information about how that actually
                        worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Yes. Walentynowicz was a totally political appointee, as you know. The
                    White House was very well aware of the existence of SCA because of the various
                    problems between Barbara Watson and Walentynowicz, which did involve prominent
                    people on the Hill, most notably Jacob Javits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you mean Walentynowicz or Frances Knight?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Walentynowicz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walentynowicz also?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Very much so. I should clarify by saying that Barbara Watson did not
                    want to leave. She particularly did not want to give way to a man that she felt
                    wholly unqualified and whom after she met him, she didn't like. Barbara
                    recruited support where she could, and one of the strongest supporters that she
                    found was Senator Jacob Javits. This was a political thing. Javits was from New
                    York. Barbara was from a very prominent black family in New York. There are a
                    number of leading black figures in New York from her family, including her own
                    father and brothers. Her family could help turn out the black vote for Jacob
                    Javits, who was running for reelection to the Senate in 1974. So all the time
                    that he was running for re-election, he was anxious to keep Barbara and her
                    family in his camp. He worked very, very hard to keep Barbara right there and to
                    keep Walentynowicz at bay. As a very prominent Republican, he had the clout to
                    do it and did succeed in doing it. However, this caused exceedingly bad blood on
                    both sides, Barbara resenting Walentynowicz's pressures to get her out and to
                    fight what she was trying to do, and Walentynowicz resenting what Barbara was
                    doing, keeping him out of the job. So the White House became very well aware of
                    the existence of this. This was a fully political thing. It had nothing to do
                    with the Foreign Service or careers or anything else—fully political. The White
                    House also became aware that S.C.A. was a place where you could put people. For
                    example, they had a young man who was of White Russian extraction. He was a
                    Republican from North Dakota, working as an aide in the White House. In the
                    middle of all this, he was sent over to take over the deputy administrator job,
                    which Fred Smith had had. Fred Smith was still there, because he hadn't been
                    reassigned. This young man came over, not formally assigned to Fred's job,
                    because he couldn't be until Fred moved on; but took over Fred's office and
                    became, technically, the other deputy administrator. He had absolutely no
                    background in consular affairs. Nevertheless, this man did stay on and was there
                    when I left. He was a White Russian of fairly distinguished lineage. He and
                    Walentynowicz did not get along well at all. He did not consider Walentynowicz a
                    man of the same social background that he had. I won't go into that further. I
                    mention this because it was a result of White House awareness of what was going
                    on there.To come back to your question, the White House really paid very little
                    attention otherwise to what went on in SCA, other than periodically, if somebody
                    in the White House had some interest in an American citizen who was in trouble
                    and needed protection, or the usual things. The political direction of the
                    Bureau came from the oversight committee on the Hill. As far as the executive
                    side was concerned, policy direction senior to that which was dealt with by
                    Barbara herself came from higher echelons in the Department, primarily from the
                    Deputy Under Secretary for Management. That was the line of command. If it was a
                    political question, then obviously it was the Deputy or Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting. I don't know what else you want
                        to say generally about your tenure in SCA, so what I'd like to do now is
                        simply ask you to say whatever you think I have not asked or has not been
                        covered that should be covered if we want to have a complete record.</hi>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: There is very little, except I would say two things of interest. One
                    came up in the latter part of my time there, the well known Harmon case in
                    Chile, which later became the subject of a movie, the name of which I forget,
                    and a movie I never wanted to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Missing.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Yes. This was an example, to my mind, of the most vicious pillorying
                    of the Department and the most unfair misrepresentation, really, of what we were
                    doing and trying to do. I'm not getting into the Chile question as such, the
                    overthrow of the regime and everything else. This man Harmon, and developing him
                    into a hero, I was always very distressed about. I won't use this occasion to
                    smear Harmon further, but it was a case of very real media misrepresentation of
                    the facts, of media unwillingness to listen to what we had to say. We had one
                    very distressing interview with Ike Pappas, from CBS, who was handling this. The
                    man would simply not allow me to say really what the facts of the case were, and
                    there was a very big consular angle on us, because this was a protection case.
                    They were, of course, interested in smearing the whole American role in the
                    overthrow of the Allende Government. This made a very good human interest story
                    played the way they wanted to play it. But it did teach me the problems of
                    trying to deal with the media, which I already knew pretty well from my days in
                    Vietnam, when they wished to play something one way, and you wished to give them
                    the facts, which they don't wish to hear. We came out very badly on that. I
                    think the consular officer concerned was not seriously hurt by it, but he
                    certainly wasn't helped by the media smearing of the job he did. Did you see the
                    movie?</p>

                        true.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: You were right, and they were wrong. This raised one other thing I'd
                    like to mention about media. We did have a person in the Bureau whose job was to
                    be our public relations officer. This was something Barbara Watson attached a
                    lot of importance to, and I think through using this person, she succeeded in
                    getting us a good deal of press coverage on consular relations in matters which
                    we would not otherwise have gotten, and possibly turning some stories to our
                    favor, and also improving our congressional relations. Out of this came
                    something that I did want to mention, and that was the possibility that they
                    would develop for television a series on the consular officer. At that time,
                    there was a very popular series called “The FBI”. It came on every week and
                    always ended with the FBI getting their man. Through our public relations
                    efforts and through the interest of one of the people in the consular service, a
                    lady whose name I forget now, who had some contacts in Hollywood, we actually
                    developed this thing to the point where a team of people from Hollywood came to
                    SCA to look into the question of filming stories about the life of a consular
                    officer, along the lines of “The FBI”. We saw this as something which would be a
                    real possibility for very excellent public relations for the Foreign Service as
                    a whole and, of course, tremendous for the consular side of the Service.We had
                    several meetings. The first meeting, which was the meeting with the full group
                    of people from Hollywood, was really something unbelievable. I'll never forget
                    it. It was absolutely right out of the books. These people were just what you'd
                    expect, the type of people who put on these potboilers that we see all the time
                    on television. Here they were. We had some stories that were rather good stories
                    about consular experiences, some such things as the famous finding of the bodies
                    back many years ago up in the Himalayas after the plane crash of some 80 people,
                    and dealings with the Nepalese Government. They thought these were interesting.
                    They didn't see that they were going to be able to do too much, but the one
                    thing they said was, “If we're going to have this kind of thing, first of all,
                    the way we visualize this, we've got to have this consular officer, a beautiful
                    babe, really stacked. She could be mature, around 30. She's going to be the one
                    who really gets the things done. Then we've got to have a guy who's sort of a
                    foil to her, a guy who's pretty dumb. He could probably be her boss.” So they
                    went on to develop this, and wanted to know if they could move her around, so
                    they could have it one time in Zanzibar, the next time in Shanghai, or whatever.
                    Then they said, “You've got to end these things with a little excitement. The
                    best thing is to always have a chase.” They were dead serious. I can remember
                    that we sat there and looked at these people. All that they could really think
                    of was the typical type of potboiler, the little plot ending with a chase and
                    maybe some guy getting shot.</p>

                    were able to get to first base with them. We did go over it pretty thoroughly,
                    but there was no way you could fit the kind of stories that we had into the kind
                    of thing they had in mind.</p>

                        I'd like, however, to spend a little more time discussing your experiences
                        in the asylum program of the United States. My own personal experience is
                        such that I know something about it, but I think there is a lot of
                        background here that is not generally known. I wonder if you could give some
                        historical background, and specifically the way our policy developed with
                        regard to asylum, and what the Department of State's role in it is.</hi>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: I will try to confine myself to those things, which are not equally
                    available from books. The early history of international interest in refugee
                    movements is something, which is very adequately recorded. Prior to World War
                    II, the concept of asylum, as any specific type of remedy available to the
                    refugees, simply was not a matter of anything more than just very general
                    discussion. Asylum was limited pretty much to what took place in South America,
                    where some guy would stage a coup which failed, and take asylum at an embassy
                    there. It didn't really emerge, as you know, until the convention in 1951, held
                    under UN auspices, which concerned itself with refugee movements in Europe and
                    which, for the first time, came up with a general definition of refugee. Prior
                    to that, refugees were just categories of peoples, but there was no general
                    definition which could be applied to an individual to say whether he was a
                    refugee or not in the broad sense. They came up with the now very familiar
                    formulation of a refugee as one who has a well-founded fear or persecution
                    because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
                    or political opinion. That was formulated for the first time in the convention
                    in 1951, the convention which concerned itself with refugee movements in Europe,
                    which the United States never became a party to. In 1967, also in the UN, a
                    protocol was drawn up which recognized the fact that by that time, refugee
                    problems had become global, and many, many countries outside of Europe adhered
                    to this protocol, which was passed by the General Assembly, and the United
                    States also became a party to that. Really, when you talk about American
                    involvement in asylum matters, you've got to begin in 1967. I think, as of 1967,
                    there was very little awareness of asylum in the United States. I think
                    immigration lawyers had very little awareness of it. If you look back at the
                    books at that time, there was nothing in the federal regulations about it; there
                    was no legislation, other than our adherence to the convention and to the
                    protocol. The number of asylum cases which arose each year were very, very few
                    and, in those days, involved mainly people from the traditional asylum-seeking
                    areas, particularly Eastern Europe. Only when I got involved in asylum matters,
                    which was not until ten years later, in 1977, was there any real volume of
                    asylum cases coming in.The asylum issue did not come to the consciousness of
                    more than a very few people until the now famous Kudirka case in 1971. As you
                    recall, that was the case of a Lithuanian seaman who jumped overboard from a
                    Soviet trawler onto an American Coast Guard ship and requested asylum. His case
                    was referred to Washington and reviewed here in the Department. Nevertheless, on
                    instructions received by the captain of the Coast Guard ship, from Coast Guard
                    headquarters, he was turned back over to the Soviets, the Coast Guard captain
                    even allowing armed Soviets to come onto our Coast Guard ship to manacle him and
                    drag him, screaming, off the ship and back onto his own ship. It was a very
                    shocking thing. It did hit the press and did result in very extensive and rather
                    fascinating hearings on the Hill, looking into this sort of thing, and it
                    resulted in, among other things, most importantly to us, awareness on the
                    executive side at the very top, namely with the President, of the fact that
                    things were going on here, that we had obligations in the sphere of asylum that
                    we were not fulfilling. As a result of this, an executive order was issued by
                    the President in which he instructed specifically that all parts of the
                    government (i.e., of the Executive Branch) concerned with refugee matters should
                    adhere very strictly to the obligations which the United States had undertaken
                    under the 1967 UN Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, that all of our
                    activities taken by this would be under the overall guidance, oversight, if you
                    will, of the Department of State. This is a matter of history. This executive
                    order led to formulation of a procedure. Meetings were held—I've never found
                    much in the way of real details about these meetings—between the Department and
                    INS specifically, to establish a procedure to assure that a Kudirka case would
                    never happen again, and, to go beyond that, to establish some sort of a
                    regularized procedure for the handling of asylum applications. The biggest
                    problem facing the country at that time in the asylum area were the Haitian
                    cases, as these people were pouring in from Haiti. There was no refugee program
                    for Haitians and no way they could come as refugees. They weren't under any
                    program, but they would arrive here and demand asylum. So the first big volume
                    of cases that we had were from Haitians. At the same time that the Kudirka case
                    had made immigration lawyers and others much more aware of the existence of
                    asylum, and even though in the early Seventies there was no great international
                    activity generating refugees, as there was in the latter part of the 1970s, the
                    number of cases did grow. When I came in in 1977, as I think back on most of the
                    cases that I dealt with, we had a number of cases from the Philippines. Marcos
                    had declared martial law, and many Filipinos sought to remain in the United
                    States. There were also a number of cases from Korea, obviously also Russian
                    cases, Chinese cases, Eastern Bloc cases, a certain number from the Middle East,
                    and a certain number from elsewhere. Quite a few from Africa. Bits and pieces
                    everywhere. There was no great pattern. It was established that applicants would
                    apply for asylum to INS, who would forward the application to the State
                    Department for an advisory opinion before reaching a final decision on the
                    merits of the application. It was felt that the Department was in the best
                    position to evaluate an asylum claim in light of the situation in the country of
                    the claimant's nationality. As this procedure began to be implemented, INS found
                    that many of the cases they were getting were simply routine cases, cases where
                    there was absolutely no doubt as to what the decision should be. So, INS asked
                    for and got the agreement of the Department to a modified procedure. I'm not
                    going to get into details here of procedures; that's all available elsewhere,
                    but this part is interesting, that having felt that there were cases that were
                    so clearly frivolous and others that were so clearly meritorious, they said,
                    “Rather than ask you for an advisory opinion in every case, couldn't we just ask
                    for an advisory opinion on those applications which really do seem to have some
                    question about them? On those which are clearly one extreme to the other, we'll
                    evaluate them, let you know our decision and if we don't hear from you in 30
                    days, we'll act on that decision.” It was agreed that they could do that. That
                    procedure was the one that pertained at the time that I came in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been 1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Yes. I gather that it pertained from 1974 on. Several things happened
                    shortly after 1977. One was that the development of refugees began to be much
                    greater around the world. We had, for example, the situation in Lebanon, where
                    you had vast numbers of people fleeing the Lebanese civil war, if you want to
                    call it that, or civil strife. You had the situation in Ethiopia, where the
                    Emperor had been overthrown and all the members in the former government, those
                    who enjoyed a high position there were fleeing the country. You had the Eritrean
                    civil war situation, which was creating refugees. You had the situation in
                    Chile, which created an increasing number of refugees in the late Seventies. So,
                    suddenly, from a relatively quiet period, here we had situations generating
                    refugees all around the world, and refugees who really were not encompassed by
                    existing legislation, which primarily took care of refugees from the Soviet bloc
                    and from the Middle East, or special programs such as those for the Cubans or
                    the Vietnamese. A lot of other people were, in one way or another, not fitting
                    into existing refugee programs, and therefore taking a new route by seeking to
                    come to the United States by whatever means, and then, when arriving here,
                    asking for asylum. So it was a new ball game. Immigration lawyers were well
                    aware of it.So you had this happen. This meant that the volume of cases coming
                    to INS began to be very great, and although they were quite willing to declare
                    an awful lot of them frivolous and a few of them clearly meritorious, and give
                    us relatively few as doubtful, we began to be very much more concerned as to
                    whether there weren't a heck of a lot of cases being declared frivolous by INS
                    which maybe, had INS had more knowledge of what they were doing, would not have
                    been considered frivolous cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The point really being that INS is not chartered to make
                        foreign affairs assessments and judgments. It's not their job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: That's right. It is not their job. Their job is to handle the legal
                    aspects of asylum, make decisions on whether somebody is entitled to asylum in
                    terms of whether he meets the legal tests. The political tests, and whether an
                    applicant is persecuted in his country, they really are not in a position to
                    judge. If they can tell if he's a drug addict or something, they can disqualify
                    him on such grounds, or if he's a criminal, although, parenthetically, I would
                    say that often comments that we have made on advisory opinions have overlapped
                    into such matters. This paralleled other developments. The generation of
                    refugees, on the one hand, vastly increased our own government's interest in
                    human rights under the Carter Administration. Carter's representative in the
                    Department on the human rights side, Pat Derian, personally greatly dedicated to
                    human rights, was very concerned about the refugee problem and whether we in our
                    handling of these refugee problems were really fully cognizant of and properly
                    sympathetic to the human rights aspect. So Pat Derian became actively interested
                    in asylum. This was in many ways a useful thing, even though it caused us some
                    problems, and she wished to create more careful screening of refugees. She
                    reached an agreement with Castillo, who was the Commissioner of INS at that
                    time, as a result of which all applications received by the INS thereafter, and
                    without exception, had to be reviewed in the Department and an advisory opinion
                    issued. That is, of course, the system that still is being followed today. Pat
                    Derian did institute something else, which I'm glad to say has not been
                    followed. In addition to the then-existing procedure under which all cases were
                    reviewed both by an asylum officer and by the desk officer of the country
                    concerned, she wished to have the human rights officer for the country concerned
                    also review them all. That was found to be quite impractical and was quickly
                    abandoned.In connection with this whole question of the review of cases, a great
                    deal of pressure had come from our handling of the Haitian cases. Haitians were
                    the first large number of refugees to come into this country asking for asylum.
                    There also was a great deal of political interest in Haitian refugees,
                    particularly on the part of the black community, but also, in general, as to
                    whether we were treating them right. This became the subject of hearings on the
                    Hill. These hearings took place just a little bit before I began to work on
                    asylum matters, and there was a great deal of concern expressed in these
                    hearings about whether we were providing an adequate review procedure for
                    Haitian asylum applications. The argument was that we were getting very little
                    information and that we were making decisions without proper inquiry, and that
                    possibly there was a certain amount of bias on the part of the United States
                    Government on the executive side, that we just flat didn't want all these
                    Haitians here. To meet this objection, somebody in ORM, I think maybe Jim
                    Carlin, thought we should use the fact that we work very closely with the UNHCR
                    [United Nations High Commission for Refugees] on these things. So in the
                    hearings—and the hearings were a matter of record—it was brought out by whoever
                    was testifying on the part of the Department, I think probably Jim Carlin—that
                    we were using the UNHCR to be sure that we were conforming with the requirements
                    of the Convention and Protocol. Someone on the Senate side said, “Do they really
                    look at every case you do? You say you work closely with them. Do you on
                    individual cases?”Whoever was talking on the part of the Department said, “No,
                    but we discuss it in general.”“Why don't you show them individual cases? They
                    should be the best authority on whether these people really qualify for
                    asylum.”The Department officer replied, “We could certainly do this.” Then it
                    occurred, I think, to both sides that this would be a great way to get everybody
                    involved off the hook insofar as criticism about our handling of Haitian cases
                    was concerned. We could say, “Look, we don't handle them. This isn't just an
                    American thing. The UNHCR is involved in this.” So an unfortunate decision was
                    made, that the UNHCR would review every single Haitian case. It was totally
                    impractical from the beginning. The UNHCR didn't even have a Washington office
                    at that time. The guy they had here was not remotely involved in asylum matters,
                    and the man who was knowledgeable on asylum matters was in New York. First they
                    said, “We'll bundle up cases and send them to New York.” That didn't work out.
                    Then they sent somebody down here who was supposed to come down for three weeks
                    and go through all our Haitian cases. To make a long story short, it simply
                    didn't work; it fell apart. It also resulted in perfectly terrible confusion
                    about Haitian cases and was another one of the factors that created an awareness
                    that we should have more organization for dealing with asylum cases.</p>

                        interesting element, which is the selection of people to perform the asylum
                        function in both State and the Department of Justice, INS, and the
                        immigration courts. I think it would be very interesting to have your
                        comments on the selection process of people in the State Department. I think
                        it might be unfair to ask you to comment on how Justice chooses people,
                        because that would really be from the outside looking in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Yes, I really don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But as far as State is concerned, you were on the inside
                        looking in. Can you give us your experiences and perceptions on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: The handling of asylum really is one of these things that grew like
                    topsy in the Department. I've given the background. Once the decision was made
                    that asylum would be handled by INS, with the Department just giving advisory
                    opinions, the thing began to lose the front burner interest that it briefly had
                    in the Department, and it became very much back burner.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The function was assigned to ORM at that time, and a relatively junior officer
                    was transferred over from the passport office to handle the asylum things under
                    the overall guidance of a middle-level officer in ORM, with the very occasional
                    interest on the part of the senior officer in that office. Really, it devolved
                    upon this quite junior officer, Larry Arthur, a very able young man in many
                    ways, but it devolved upon him, really, to carry the burden of the whole
                    day-to-day operation on asylum matters, with very little interest being
                    demonstrated by anybody else in the Department. Only as the workload began to
                    increase to the point where one man could not handle it, particularly since that
                    one man was also called upon to spend a great deal of his time with regard to
                    these Haitian cases was any interest shown in getting some help for him. There
                    were no slots available for any regularly assigned officer to do this, so the
                    idea was arrived at, “Why can't we use some newly-retired officer or some
                    retiring officer to do this?” The first person who came into this was Jules
                    Bassin. Jules knew Jim Carlin, who was then Director of ORM, from his Geneva
                    days and had a reasonably good background. Jules is a lawyer and was qualified
                    to train himself sufficiently in asylum matters, to work with the individual
                    bureaus on individual country questions, and really provide the additional
                    assistance which was needed by Larry. This worked out quite well so long as
                    Jules, who was brought back as a rehired annuitant, was able to work as a
                    rehired annuitant. However, he ran out of his time. He came up to his ceiling,
                    so there was no differential between what he was getting as an annuity and what
                    his salary had been when he left, so he was not able to continue working, and
                    there were no provisions for a contract. So they then looked around and, to my
                    mind, paid much too little attention to getting qualified people and too much
                    attention to just getting somebody to do the job to help out. I will not now go
                    into names. The need for people to help in 1976 and through the time after I
                    came on was largely met by simply finding somebody, usually with a general
                    consular background, but no necessarily particularly useful country background,
                    to do the job for a while before he finally went out on retirement. The only
                    person who came in with qualifications similar to Jules was myself, and I was
                    brought in by Jim Carlin, who recognized the need, with Jules departing, for
                    somebody who had some more in- depth background and would be able to head up the
                    thing a bit more. Larry continued very competently to do his job, but, in
                    general, it was perforce an effort to get the job done, and, to my mind, not
                    sufficient attention being paid to expertise. Until around 1980, when the
                    Iranian crisis and these other various refugee-generating crises reached such
                    proportions that he problem became quite different than it had been in the late
                    Seventies, was greater attention paid to trying to recruit people who really did
                    have some qualifications, the qualifications being someone with a good consular
                    background, somebody with area background pertinent to the area in which he
                    would be reviewing asylum cases, and somebody with sufficient seniority and
                    experience to bring to bear a judgment which really would assure meaningful
                    evaluation of asylum cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Since that time, with the exception of a period when an effort was made to try to
                    find people with these qualifications who were over-complement (a contradictory
                    situation, if you think about it, since most people are over-complement because
                    they don't have very good qualifications), I think we have done better in
                    recruiting qualified people. I do have many ideas, which I don't think this is
                    the place to go into, about how we really should run this thing, but I do think
                    that the effort is being made now, at least to bring in qualified people.
                    Unfortunately, the idea of recruiting people from active Foreign Service and
                    relatively junior people to do the same work is a great mistake. I think this is
                    not a job for a regularly- assigned officer; it's too much out of the main line.
                    Any regularly-assigned officer is going to want to get out of it, get somewhere
                    where he's more visible. It's an excellent job for qualified retired people. I
                    hope it will continue in that vein. One other thing I should say. I think, also,
                    it should be understood for the record, how it is that asylum remains in HA [the
                    Bureau of Human Rights]. This is a typical example of a political decision, and
                    it should be a matter of record that it's a political decision which I think has
                    utterly disregarded the proper logic of the situation. Asylum is a refugee
                    matter; it is not a human rights matter. It's intimately connected with refugee
                    problems, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It is in the Human
                    Rights Bureau only because when the refugee part of human rights was taken away
                    from the Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Bureau and put into a separate
                    bureau, Pat Derian, then the Assistant Secretary for Human Rights, was placated
                    by being given one operational unit—namely, the asylum unit. She shouldn't have
                    been. It was simply a decision made at the White House to keep a political
                    appointee happy; it was not a decision made on the merits of where the thing
                    should be. That should be understood, I think, for the record. That winds up
                    what I can say on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure there are many more things you could say, but
                        generally I think we've had a very rich exchange. This is going to be very,
                        very valuable. Do you want to say one more thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Yes. I did want to say one thing about how it came about that we had
                    this particularly enormous problem with the Iranian asylum-seekers. Unlike the
                    situations which generated refugees elsewhere, the idea of a refugee program for
                    Iranians was highly unpopular in this country following the overthrow of the
                    Shah in 1979. Iranians, in general, were extremely unpopular. Any program
                    designed to throw Iranians out generally met with much favor, and any program
                    designed to permit Iranians to enter or to stay in the U.S. generally did not
                    meet with much favor. The only real pressure to help Iranians came from the
                    religious minority groups, particularly the Jews, but also the Christians, and a
                    certain amount of pressure from people who wanted to help out very prominent
                    Iranians from the Shah's regime. People who were very fond of Iran wanted to
                    bring in people who were close to the Shah. But apart from that, if you recall,
                    the feeling in this country was very much opposed to Iranians. So even though
                    there was a lot of pressure brought by Jewish, Christian groups, and others on
                    the Hill for a refugee program, the House was not about to touch the idea of a
                    specific refugee program for Iranians.At the same time, the Administration was
                    coming up with a program which didn't allow any Iranian after March 1980 to even
                    renew his visa. So two things happened. For Iranians in this country, the only
                    way they could possibly stay was to ask for asylum. For Iranians outside of the
                    country, there was no way to bring them in as refugees, because there was no
                    refugee program, so the only thing that one could do was to establish a program
                    which brought them in either as visitors, and allow them, once they got here, to
                    request asylum, or to parole them in, and once they got here, allow them to
                    request asylum. Thus a program of very dubious legality was arrived at to help
                    Iranian religious minorities and certain other Iranians we wished to help. This
                    was a program whereby not too many questions were asked with regard to such
                    Iranians applying for B-2 visitors visas to come to this country, and whereby
                    those who clearly couldn't qualify still had a chance to get paroled in. So we
                    had thousands of Iranians arriving in this country as visitors or under parole
                    and asking for asylum, and no refugee program for Iranians. That is really the
                    background of the Iranian asylum program and the one asylum program which
                    certainly generated the very largest number of successful applicants of any we
                    have had. Also, while all of this was going on with the Iranians, it was not
                    being lost sight of by Ethiopians, Lebanese, and others. Much of the real
                    pressure generated by various groups for asylum has come from their awareness of
                    what happened with the Iranians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably, this also had an impact on the enormous number
                        of Salvadorans who came to this country and asked for asylum, that now
                        probably being the nationality where there is the single largest flow of
                        asylum cases through the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RECKNAGEL: Absolutely. I think that the Salvadoran one is more pertinent than any
                    that I mentioned, because certainly the fact that we did this for Iranians and
                    are not doing it for Salvadorans has been one of the very sore points that
                    Salvadorans have not missed.</p>
