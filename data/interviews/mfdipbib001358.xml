                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today June 21, 2004. This is an interview with Ruth E.
                        Hansen. Let's start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and where you
                        were born and then we'll talk a little bit about your family, your
                        parents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I was born in 1946 in Chicago. My family is originally from Chicago, both
                    parents born there. My father was raised on the West Side, in the Austin
                    neighborhood, and my mother on the South Side.</p>
                <p>On my father's side, his family on his father's side came from Norway, immigrants
                    who came to the United States in the mid-1800s, I guess. I have heard the story
                    of his grandmother coming as a 13-year-old and going into service with a Chicago
                    family. His own father was a high school principal in Chicago. His father and
                    all his uncles graduated from Northwestern University and went into a variety of
                    professioneducation, law, pharmacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With an immigrant family, this is sort of remarkable that
                        they would be within a relatively short time going to Northwestern, being a
                        high school principal and in other professions. What was the secret of their
                        getting into that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I don't know if there was a secret. I do remember my grandfather, the
                    high school principal, always saying we should “keep our standards high.” I
                    suspect that was a lesson from his own family and had something to do with their
                    success.</p>
                <p>Q: What did your father do?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HANSEN: My father was originally a teacher as well, in the period just before
                    World War II. He taught briefly in the same high school where my grandfather was
                    the principal, Sullivan High School in Chicago. He also taught at a couple of
                    junior colleges in Chicago and then served in the Navy during the war as an air
                    navigation instructor. He was assigned to Athens, Georgia, to a naval air
                    station near Chicago, and in Florida, and then spent a few months in Hawaii
                    during the de-mobilization period after the war. Later, as his family grew and
                    financial demands grew, he went into business. With two friends, he invested in
                    a small printing company in Chicago, Acme Letter Company in the late 1940s. The
                    company was faltering, so he soon bought out the partners in order to take
                    responsibility for the company and make it a success. He remained in the
                    printing business until he retired at about the age of 70. He started with about
                    ten employees, built it up into a firm of over 100, later merged with another
                    company and ultimately sold the business.</p>
                <p>The other side of his family is interesting as well. On his mother's side, the
                    background is English and German. They were much earlier immigrants to the
                    country, settling in Pennsylvania and then moving to Kentucky and eventually
                    into Kansas. The legendary family character we always talk about on that side of
                    the family is my father's grandfather, who was called “Doc” Workman. He was a
                    doctor, probably a fairly rudimentary physician, in Kansas in the late 1800s and
                    did some exploration out in Colorado in what is now the Estes Park National Park
                    area. We had an old family cabin there that we used to go to in the summertime
                    occasionally. It was very rustic, with no running water, no electricity, nothing
                    except the howling of the wolves in the distance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about his wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Doc Workman actually had four wives over the years. He lived to a very
                    old age and outlived each of his wives, one of whom was the mother of my
                    grandmother, Grace. Grace became a nurse and, after what I understand was a
                    rather lengthy courtship, finally agreed to marry my grandfather. They had met
                    when he visited Colorado one summer while Grace was there.I think they were both
                    around 40 years of age, so they got married rather late and then they had their
                    two children, my father and his sister, Elaine. Elaine was quite the beauty. She
                    was a model for a time and then married a doctor, Leslie Lisle, and lived in
                    Columbus, Ohio, with their three children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your mother's side, what was her family name and where
                        did they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HANSEN: On my mother's side, the family is Swedish and more recent immigrants who
                    arrived in the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Her father, Henning Ohrn,
                    immigrated as a young man and, though he spoke English very well, spoke with a
                    rather heavy Swedish accent. His wife, Frida Swanson, was born in the United
                    States. They lived in Chicago and my mother and her sister Victoria and brother
                    Carl were all raised there in Chicago. Grandpa Ohrn worked for the International
                    Harvester Company, rising to the position of foreman. He was fortunate in that
                    he held his job even through all of the Great Depression, and family lore has it
                    that he often helped out and supported the less fortunate during that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your parents go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: My father graduated from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois, in 1938.
                    He later earned a teacher's degree from Chicago Teachers College and a Master's
                    in history from Northwestern University. My mother attended for two years what
                    was then a junior college in Chicago, North Park College, now North Park
                    University, a denominational school of the Evangelical Covenant Church. Then she
                    went on to complete her undergraduate studies in English at the University of
                    Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up in Chicago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I was in Chicago until the second grade. I attended the John Hay
                    Elementary School in the neighborhood. Then we moved out to Wheaton in the
                    western suburbs of Chicago, so I mainly grew up in Wheaton, Illinois.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Wheaton like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: When we moved there it was a small town on the edge of the suburban
                    developments for the Chicago area. Beyond Wheaton were the corn fields. At that
                    time, the population was about 11,000. It's now well over 30,000 and surrounded
                    by still more bedroom communities. It was a very much middle class, perhaps
                    upper middle class, suburban WASP-ish upbringing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on it, was there much of a Scandinavian
                        overtone within your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HANSEN: There certainly was, mainly because of my mother's Swedish family. The
                    church that we attended was part of the Evangelical Covenant Church
                    denomination, originally a breakaway from the Swedish Lutheran Church.. Our
                    particular church in the neighboring town of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, had a very
                    much Swedish element, especially at Christmas time. They had Christmas services
                    that reflected Swedish traditions, complete with the Santa Lucia service. That's
                    the ceremony with the young girls dressed in white, one of them wearing a wreath
                    of candles, with the “Santa Lucia” music in the background. One Christmas, I was
                    asked to be the Lucia so I had the wreath of candles in my hair, had to recite a
                    little poem and so forth. My most striking memory, though was the fire
                    extinguisher in the front row of the church. Anyway, it was a nice little
                    ceremony. Very warm memories of that time, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there Swedish cooking in the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, of course, thanks to Grandma Ohrn. We always had a smorgasbord
                    dinner on Christmas Eve. The main remnants of the Swedish cooking traditions
                    that we retain is the tradition of Swedish pancakes with lingonberry sauce, not
                    to mention Swedish meatballs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I'm one of five children, second in line. I have an older brother
                    Richard, a sister Beth, and two younger brothers, Ted and Larry. With five kids,
                    I'm sure that everybody has a different story of what that the family was like.
                    My older brother was actually born a twin. His twin brother died just a few days
                    after the birth. In the 1940's, of course, a premature birth was a pretty risky
                    situation, and the other twin couldn't be saved. Richard has been a reference
                    librarian for many years and works at Regis College in Denver. My sister is also
                    a librarian, a faculty librarian at Governor State University in Illinois, and
                    is married to Mike Shaw. My brother Ted lives in Indianapolis with his wife Ann
                    and their three daughters. Ted was actually in the Foreign Service himself for a
                    few years and served in Caracas and then, after he left the State Department,
                    for a long time was the stay-at-home father. The youngest brother is a
                    neoropathologist, as is his partner Nancy Harrison, and he teaches
                    neuropathology at the University of California at San Diego. So we're pretty
                    well spread out. But we do manage to keep in touch and to get together whenever
                    we can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned two of your siblings were librarians. How
                        important were books in your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HANSEN: We all did an awfully lot of reading. We were a very bookish family, very
                    academically oriented. We were expected to do well in school. We've all got a
                    couple of advanced degrees at least, so that high standard that my grandfather
                    used to talk about very much applied in the area of academics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What particular types of books or subjects intrigued
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I enjoyed reading the biographies that were written for children on such
                    figures as Sam Houston and Clara Barton and Molly Pitcher from American history.
                    But I was also very much into the books series for kids, such as the Bobbsey
                    Twins stories and the Nancy Drew mysteries. Then, for a while my role models for
                    career professions were Cherry Ames the nurse and Vickie Barr the airline
                    hostess. Those were the things that I thought about as a career when I was, say,
                    in the fifth or sixth grade. Not very high aspirations in retrospect, but it
                    seemed exciting at the time. I have to credit an English teacher in about the
                    seventh grade who said this is ridiculous, that I should be reading better
                    things than those “girls' books”. He got me to read the Bronte sisters and Jane
                    Austen, among other authors, so my reading got a little more serious in junior
                    high and high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you were a good student?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I was not a straight A student, but I tried to be and got close a number
                    of times, but basically As and Bs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at home? Was there much of sort of the family
                        sitting around the table at dinner time and talk about events or subjects or
                        things of this nature or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, I think my parents would have loved it and tried to make it happen,
                    and I'm sure it did on occasion, but I wouldn't say that that it was an everyday
                    occurrence with five kids with different schedules and a hardworking father with
                    a long commute. It was pretty much a feat to get dinner on the table and
                    everybody around the table at one time. Plus many times we were in a hurry to
                    finish dinner and get back to television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, you were in the era of television just coming
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HANSEN: I remember some of the very early television programs from when we were
                    kids in Chicago: Lunchtime Little Theater, the Howdy Doody Show, Hopalong
                    Cassidy, Roy Rogers; and for the adults, Your Hit Parade. By the time we got out
                    to Wheaton, it seemed that the TV was on all the time. I didn't watch it as much
                    as my younger brothers and my sister did, but it seems to me that that TV was on
                    just constantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular things that you liked on
                        TV?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: On daytime television, there were a few quiz shows I used to watch with
                    some regularity and really a silly program called Queen for a Day where women
                    would be invited to tell their sob stories and the audience would vote for which
                    of two or three women had the most dramatic sob story. Then she would be awarded
                    all kinds of prizes to make her feel better, I guess, and deal with her
                    problems. It was really a ridiculous program. There were a lot of TV series and
                    sitcoms in the evenings that we watched with some regularity. There was Father
                    Knows Best, Leave it to Beaver, Superman, standard fare. There was the really a
                    very dramatic story of the FBI agent, Richard Philbrick, I Led Three Lives and,
                    on late night TV, The Tonight Show with Jack Paar.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In school, what subjects particularly interested you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I would say reading. I wasn't very enthusiastic about math and science. I
                    had a sort of typical girl thing at the time in terms of difficulty with math. I
                    liked doing math but it seemed kind of tricky to me. Maybe it was a kind of
                    dyslexia in math. But reading I loved and was very comfortable with.</p>
                <p>When I got to high school, there was a special world literature class for
                    seniors. The teacher was well liked and it was a really popular course and for
                    good reason. Students selected their own readings from a list of works from the
                    ancient Greek and Roman period right up to the present. You had to choose across
                    genres and group up with other students to give presentations to the class on
                    one selection. At that time, our junior high and high schools were just
                    beginning to introduce advanced courses for what would today be called “gifted”
                    students. Not surprisingly, I wasn't admitted to the advanced math courses. But
                    I was disappointed not to get into an advanced writing course. I appealed that
                    to the high school English Department and managed to get into the advanced
                    writing course taught by another popular English teacher, a Miss Kidwell. She
                    took no nonsense from the students and, very dramatically, dumped all of our
                    first essays into the trash can. Dead silence in the classroom. We were
                    stunned.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>In high school I had to take a foreign language and I signed up for was Spanish.
                    You had the choice of Spanish, French, Latin, probably German. I really fell in
                    love with the Spanish language and took Spanish during all four years in high
                    school. I had a very memorable teacher for three of those years, a Mr. Samper.
                    He gave us a good grounding in the grammar and got us into the literature and
                    culture quite a bit. During high school I also became interested in history,
                    government, political science. I'm not sure just what sparked it, but it was
                    during high school that I decided I'd like to be in the Foreign Service, though
                    I'm sure I didn't even know just what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that boys went off in one direction
                        and girls in another in education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Somewhat, although certainly there were an awful lot of smart girls in my
                    class, with a lot of girls as the top students in high school, including in math
                    and science. It was on the playing fields where the boys and girls really
                    divided up. The boys had softball and the girls would play tetherball, for
                    example, though we were all into kickball. I liked to think of myself as
                    something of a tomboy at the time because I preferred to play softball. I do
                    regret that girls were not given better sports activities. I think I would have
                    enjoyed getting into sports more than I did. It wasn't very popular or very
                    common for girls to be really active in school sports.</p>
                <p>I attended Wheaton Central High School right there in town, graduating in 1964 in
                    a class of probably just over 400 kids. I know of at least two other Foreign
                    Service officers who came out that high school around the same time, one of whom
                    entered the Foreign Service in 1973 in the same A-100 class with me. And a
                    couple of luminaries: Bob Woodward of Washington Post and All the President's
                    Men fame was a few years ahead of me, and the actor/comic John Belushi just
                    afterward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On politics, where were your parents on the political
                        spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: On my father's side were staunch Republicans. Grandpa Hansen used to say
                    that he hoped his grandchildren would grow up to marry people who were of
                    “Northern European background, Protestant, and preferably of the Republican
                    persuasion”. My mother's side was Democratic. Wheaton is the county seat of Du
                    Page County which was and probably still is a real Republican stronghold.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So politically, as a kid, I pretty much assumed I was Republican. But I started
                    thinking a little differently during the 1960 presidential campaign between
                    Kennedy and Nixon. Nixon came to Wheaton on a campaign stop, so that was a big
                    deal and we all turned out to cheer him. But then there was the televised debate
                    between Kennedy and Nixon. The standard analysis now is that, if you heard the
                    debate on radio, Nixon seemed to come off better because you would focus more on
                    the substance of what was said in the debate. If you watched it on television,
                    then Nixon came off poorly because of his five o'clock shadow, a gray suit that
                    blended him into the background, or whatever. Well, I watched the debate on TV.
                    There I was fully expecting to favor Nixon, but instead, to my own surprise, I
                    actually thought that Kennedy did better in the debate. So I think that I was
                    influenced by that particular event because it got me thinking as an individual
                    about politics rather than following the conventional wisdom around me.</p>
                <p>In general, that was about the time that I started to become politically aware,
                    with Kennedy's election and inauguration. In terms of international events, the
                    Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis were among the first
                    international events that I paid attention to. Then in November 1963, during the
                    fall of my senior year in high school, President Kennedy was assassinated. Like
                    everyone else who was around that day, I remember just where I was and what I
                    was doing when I heard about it. We were on a half-day schedule at high school
                    that year, and on my way out of school at mid-day, I overheard a couple of
                    teachers talking about “the first assassination since ?” but didn't realize what
                    they meant. A few minutes later, over a coke at the dime store lunch counter, my
                    girlfriend and I heard the radio announcement of Kennedy's death.</p>
                <p>In terms of extracurricular activities, I didn't do that much at school. Our
                    church was largely the center of my social activity. I was very active in the
                    youth group in church and other church doings. We had the regular schedule of
                    services for the week: Sunday school and the morning service on Sunday morning,
                    a late Sunday afternoon youth group meeting, then the Sunday evening service.
                    Often the high school kids would go out someplace for hamburgers or pizza or ice
                    cream after the Sunday evening service. There was also a mid-week prayer service
                    I sometimes attended, and a choir practice, since my poor voice was tolerated in
                    the choir for a while.</p>
                <p>The youth group meeting might have involved a special speaker or discussion
                    groups, or Bible study, Bible “drills”, films, sing-alongs with the old
                    Christian choruses. It was no doubt hard for the youth group leaders and for the
                    kidI was the “program chairman” at one point - to think of something to do with
                    those kids week after week. We also had a Friday night social event and
                    occasional “retreats”. The “Hi-League retreat” would take us off to the
                    denominational camp at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, for example.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Also through the denomination, when I graduated from high school in 1964, my
                    folks sent my older brother and me on a European tour run by the Evangelical
                    Church. Ostensibly the main event was in international youth conference in
                    Switzerland, but there was a wonderful tour organized around it. The tour must
                    have lasted a good four or six weeks, a “grand tour” by bus. This was an
                    eye-opener for me in terms of what's out there by way of art and architecture
                    and all that Europe has to offer. I saw my first opera, which was “Aida”, at an
                    outdoor amphitheater in Italy, complete with live horse. It was wonderful.
                    Because of the Swedish background of the church, the tour included several days
                    in Sweden, and Richard and I had a chance to meet my mother's Swedish
                    relatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the dating situation in high school and
                        college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I myself wasn't typical because, to my dismay, I didn't date at all. Most
                    kids did, of course, and I've since gathered that there was a lot more going on
                    at my high school than I in my innocence ever imagined.In our discussions groups
                    at church, one of the burning issues that the counselors tried to get us to
                    discuss was whether a girl should kiss a boy on her first date.That was the
                    issue, at least in the counselors' minds. So that makes it seem like there
                    wasn't much happening. But in my high school there was drinking and I knew of a
                    few girls who got pregnant. That would have been very scandalous, and the unwed
                    mothers' home was the likely fate. These were the days before “The Pill”, which
                    changed things a lot.</p>
                <p>Given my family's educational background and emphasis on education, it was a
                    foregone conclusion that I would go to college. As I mentioned earlier my father
                    had attended Wheaton College there in our hometown, and my mother North Park
                    College in Chicago. Those were the only two schools I seriously considered. They
                    just seemed natural. Because of my interest in the Spanish language, I also
                    looked into Middlebury College but it wasn't a very serious option. Anyway, my
                    dad very much wanted his kids to attend Wheaton College and in the end told me
                    that that's what I would be doing. I resented it, in a way, but at the same time
                    it took the decision off my back. I was able to live on campus, which was a
                    plus, and I enjoyed the freshman year there. After that it wasn't so hot, but I
                    stayed on and graduated in 1968.</p>
                <p>Wheaton is a small Protestant school, about 1800 students, non-denominational but
                    very religious and very conservative.Billy Graham is probably its best known
                    graduate. One of our yearbooks described Wheaton College as “30 miles to the
                    right of the University of Chicago,” so that gives you an idea. There were
                    religious events all the timprayer groups, prayer meetings, classes were opened
                    with a prayer, chapel every day. I had a couple of wonderful roommates my first
                    year and other wonderful roommates thereafter. But after my freshman year I
                    couldn't wait to get out of the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the turning point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HANSEN: We used to talk about a “sophomore slump”, which I guess was a very
                    typical thing. You'd have a good freshman year and in the sophomore year you'd
                    fall into the sophomore slump. I fell into the slump and on top of that began to
                    question some of the religious teachings I'd always tried to believe in. I had
                    been raised in a religious home, always been active in church, all of that, but
                    I began to find a disconnect between what I'd been taught and what I was
                    thinking myself. In the turn of phrase, I started to “question my beliefs”
                    beginning in about my sophomore year in college.</p>
                <p>A dramatic turning point for me was in the spring of 1967, when I came to
                    Washington, D.C. on the Washington semester program at the American University
                    offered and Wheaton participated in. This program has expanded quite a bit by
                    now, but at the time it was a program that was run in the junior year of college
                    by American University for selected students from probably 20 different small
                    liberal arts colleges around the country. These students came to Washington for
                    a semester of study of American government and politics. By that time I'd become
                    very interested in political science and history. Being anxious to get away from
                    Wheaton, I applied for the Washington semester and I was accepted for it. My
                    college advisor tried to discourage me from applying. He didn't think I could
                    meet the demands of the program and, in fact, it was a difficult and challenging
                    program. But I did well in it. My time in Washington was an absolute eye opener
                    for me, coming from a small town and from Wheaton College and from such a
                    sheltered background. It just opened up a whole new world, and that was the
                    world for me from then on.</p>
                <p>There wasn't much at the time by way of formal internship programs, but I stayed
                    on in Washington for the summer of 1967 and worked for an Illinois congressman,
                    Cong. Robert McCloskey. It was glorified secretarial work, so there wasn't much
                    substance to it, but we had a good time that summer. Then it was back to Wheaton
                    College in the fall. I had enough credits to finish college after the fall
                    semester, and then I graduated with my class the following spring.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>During the spring semester, since I didn't need to attend any more classes, I
                    lined up a trip to Europe for myself. Just about the first thing that I did when
                    I got to Europe was end up at the American Consulate in Luxembourg. At that
                    time, it was populaand cheato fly to Europe via Icelandic Air trip from New York
                    to Reykjavik and then to Luxembourg. I had a second or third cousin who was
                    doing this European hitch hiking thing at the same time that I was and he had
                    gotten to Luxembourg a week or so ahead of me. When I showed up, we got together
                    briefly. It turned out that he had somehow gotten hooked up with a couple of
                    other American kids and one or two of them had been arrested, I think for
                    marijuana possession. For some reason my cousin thought that, if I went with
                    them to the consulate and promised to sort of look after these kids, then the
                    consular officer would be willing and able to help them in some way. I'm sure
                    that I had absolutely no influence, buI went with my cousin and talked with the
                    consular officer about these kids whom I had never even met myself. Somehow we
                    all went off on our merry ways. That was my first overseas experience with the
                    Foreign Service. The consular officer just looked at us in total disbelief. I
                    can't imagine what he must have thought of us, but luckily nothing further came
                    of the incident as far as I ever heard.</p>
                <p>My parents had lent me money to buy a VW bug which I picked up in Luxembourg. I
                    spent part of that spring in Bordeaux at a French university trying to learn a
                    little more French. It didn't work out very well, so I quit and then traveled
                    around Europe, sometimes with other students, sometimes by myself. I was in
                    Europe when Martin Luther King was assassinated in the U.S., and came home right
                    at the time that Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. Things were looking bleak in
                    the United States. .</p>
                <p>Going back to the Washington Semester program in 1967, this was getting to be an
                    exciting period politically. President Johnson was very controversial and
                    becoming very unpopular, terms like “strategic obfuscation” were bandied about,
                    people were getting very distrustful of government and of Johnson in particular,
                    anti-war sentiment was heating up. The American University professor who led the
                    Washington Semester Program was quite an outspoken academic, very liberal, and
                    he was determined that we would be exposed to all the controversy that was
                    swirling in Washington at that time. One of the wonderful things about this
                    Washington Semester Program was that they arranged for the classes to meet with
                    government officials in the executive, judicial and legislative branches, plus
                    lobbyists, journalists, etc., to get a good idea of how Washington worked. So we
                    had opportunities to talk to people who were directly involved in the issues of
                    the day. Again it was quite an eye opening experience to have that kind of
                    exposure. We were not a terribly outspoken group, but certainly some of the
                    students in the Washington Semester Program were more willing to challenge
                    authority than I had been and more so than students I'd been going to school
                    with back at Wheaton. That was very eye-opening, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>At this time, students across the country were getting into the protest movement,
                    the anti-Vietnam War protests, hippies, etc. This was the era of “don't trust
                    anyone over 30”, and I got into some of that, too. Even at Wheaton College, that
                    last semester I was there, there was a small anti-war group, a teeny tiny
                    chapter of Americans for Democratic Action. We staged a really small-scale
                    anti-war demonstration.</p>
                <p>After I graduated in l968, that summer, the Democratic National Convention was
                    held in Chicago. It was very raucous, very violent, with police-demonstrator
                    clashes outside. That summer I worked for my father downtown near the Loop in
                    Chicago, so I was going into the city everyday and following very closely what
                    was going on. It was eerie, to say the least, to see jeeps full of armed
                    soldiers or armed police going through the streets of Chicago. It was really
                    dramatic. I was very much sympathetic to some of the protests against Johnson
                    because of the Vietnam War and so forth, and somewhat sympathetic to the sort of
                    hippie atmosphere that pervaded the demonstrations. It was interesting since I
                    was working for my dad that summer and a lot of the employees, though they were
                    Chicagoans and probably Democrats, were on the conservative side. They couldn't
                    understand how the boss's daughter could be sympathetic to the hippies. They
                    just couldn't fathom this at all. It was a culture clash.</p>
                <p>A little later, when I was in Washington for graduate school, I went up to
                    Capitol Hill in January of 1969 when Nixon was to be inaugurated. I watched from
                    a distance and couldn't have gotten any closer. The Hill almost looked like an
                    armed camp, with phalanxes of soldiers around the Capitol building,
                    sharpshooters on the roof of the Capitol. Very eerie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the students, the male students at Wheaton going into
                        the military sort of automatically without protest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: For the most part, yes. Wheaton had an ROTC chapter, and all the men were
                    in the ROTC program. A number of them were joining the military as officers
                    after graduation. One of them, who had been either the student body president,
                    or senior class president, was opposed to the Vietnam War, as I recall, and was
                    one of the leaders of the small anti-war movement on campus. As I heard the
                    story, the president of the college threatened in some way to withhold his
                    commission. As far as I know, that didn't happen, though, and the student went
                    on to join the army as an officer upon graduation. I don't know where he served.
                    He had qualms about the war, yet he served. I expect that was often the case;
                    people just went and did their duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was next, after your graduation from Wheaton
                        College?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HANSEN: As I mentioned, since about the age of 16, I had been interested in the
                    Foreign Service. There was the influence of the Spanish classes which I enjoyed
                    so much and I wanted to do something with languages, plus I had developed an
                    interest in political science and international affairs. With those interests in
                    mind and with a strong interest in living again in Washington, DC, I had applied
                    for the Foreign Service program at Georgetown University for the Master's
                    program and I was accepted. Frankly, I really didn't know what else to do upon
                    graduation from college. I thought about going to law school, which would have
                    still been rather unusual for a woman at that time, but three years of law
                    school seemed like a long time. But I knew I could handle the Foreign Service
                    Master's program so that was kind of an easy decision.</p>
                <p>I did also apply to the Foreign Service at that time and took the written exam
                    and passed it. I took the oral exam the summer of 1968, but did not pass the
                    oral exam. In those years, the oral exam was a one- to two-hour interview by a
                    three-member panel of Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>Of the questions I remember, I'm sure there were questions on international
                    affairs, but one of the most striking questions was that they asked what my
                    marriage plans were. This kind of question is not allowed in employment
                    interviews now, but it was pretty much a standard question for a single woman at
                    the time. I wasn't offended or surprised by it, though it was awfully
                    annoying.</p>
                <p>I should add that, when I was thinking about applying for the Foreign Service, my
                    political science advisor at college told me not to do it. His reasoning was
                    that the Foreign Service generally didn't hire women, so you might as well not
                    try. He tried to discourage me but I applied anyway. This was the same adviser
                    who had discouraged me from going to the Washington Semester Program at American
                    University because he didn't think I could handle it. So I didn't get a lot of
                    encouragement from that source.</p>
                <p>Back to the question about marriage plans, in my own mind it was an easy question
                    to answer, if somewhat embarrassing. I mentioned earlier that I was atypical as
                    far as the dating scene in high school. I had not dated, even through all of
                    college. So I could very easily and honestly say that I hadn't had any romantic
                    attachments and didn't expect that I would. At that time I simply did not expect
                    ever to get married. I expected to remain single and wanted a Foreign Service
                    career. That was the answer I gave. I'm sure they didn't believe it. Then they
                    concluded the interview. I waited for their decision, and when they called me
                    back in to tell me that I had not passed the exam, the one officer said that
                    they were sorry that they couldn't admit me into the Foreign Service. But, he
                    said, you're going on to Georgetown for graduate school; you'll probably marry a
                    nice young man and you won't have to worry about a career.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>One of the other questions that they asked me was about Chicago, where the
                    interview took place. One of the interviewers was an African-American and he
                    asked me about the history of Chicago. Well, as it happened, I couldn't remember
                    much at all about the history of Chicago. And of course it turns out that one of
                    the early settlers and traders in the area that is now Chicago was a black fur
                    trader, du Sable, so his point was made. The panel also asked about whether I
                    had taken advantage of the cultural life available in Chicago, going to concerts
                    and things like that. I had done some of that, but I think I probably came
                    across sounding like a very naive, innocent, sheltered suburbanite, which is
                    what I was. In all honesty, I don't think I was really ready for the Foreign
                    Service at that point, so I can't say the Foreign Service interviewers made a
                    bad decision.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was my first experience with the Foreign Service and my college
                    advisor proved to be right, that I would have a hard time getting in.</p>
                <p>I started in the fall of 1968 and the master of science and Foreign Service
                    program there was normally, it normally took a year and a half to go through,
                    but I started working while I was at graduate school, so I extended it to a two
                    year program. The spring of 1970, so =68 to =70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown.
                        How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I started at Georgetown in the fall of 1968. The program for the Master
                    of Science in Foreign Service normally took a year and a half, but I started
                    working while I was at graduate school, so I took two years to finish the
                    program, earning the degree in the spring of 1970. We were a relatively small
                    group of students in that particular class, about 30 or 35 students. At the
                    orientation session for the program, we were told that, as a practical matter,
                    though most of us were aiming for the Foreign Service, very few of us would get
                    in, because it was so selective. They burst a few bubbles at that point, I
                    think, but turned out to be right. They said that most of us would probably go
                    into banking or business or something else, academics or whatever, related to
                    international affairs, but not the Department of State Foreign Service. Aside
                    from myself, I know of one other student from that class who joined the Foreign
                    Service after teaching for a number of years.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>There were several specialties that we could choose among. International
                    economics, international relations generally. I think you could choose a
                    regional studies specialty as well. I chose the international relations
                    specialty, although at that time my main interest was in Latin America. We had
                    some very good professors. Others were not as memorable. One of the best was the
                    professor of modern American diplomatic history. It was a wonderful,
                    enlightening course. He did a great job, and did a terrific imitation of
                    Franklin Roosevelt when we got to the World War II period. Another instructor
                    tried his best to teach us basic international economics. He was a good
                    professor but I'm afraid we just weren't getting it. In the first exam he gave,
                    most of the students got Ds or Fs. I was relieved to have gotten, I think, a B
                    or C. He was totally dismayed and seemed to think that he had thoroughly failed
                    to convey the information. It certainly wasn't his fault. He pulled us up by our
                    bootstraps and we got through his course eventually. We had a curious professor
                    for one of the Latin American studies courses, a professor who was originally
                    from Cuba. I don't remember much from the class, except that he always had jokes
                    to telin Spanish. I followed them right up to the punchline. He'd rattle off
                    that punch line and I'd miss it entirely. Everybody else would be laughing. I
                    don't know if everybody got the jokes or not, but I sure didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you working during graduate school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: When I started at Georgetown, I found it was great going to school, but I
                    was also a little bored, so I got a Christmas job at one of the catalog stores
                    that used to operate in Washington, in the jewelry section. The following summer
                    I buckled down a bit more and started looking for a government position. I found
                    a “research assistant” position at the FCC which did not turn out well at all so
                    I stayed only a couple or three months. I was then able to line up a job on
                    Capitol Hill and worked for about a year and a half for a California congressman
                    by the name of William Mailliard. He represented Marin County and the northern
                    part of San Francisco, and he was the ranking Republican, the ranking minority
                    member, on the then-Foreign Affairs Committee, now the International Relations
                    Committee. He was also on the Merchant Marine Committee. I worked on his
                    personal staff. I found the job through an employment office on Capitol Hill.The
                    title of the position was “legislative aide,” a slight cut above secretarial
                    work. My main responsibility was to answer constituent correspondence on
                    questions or concerns involving legislative issues.</p>
                <p>At the same time he was hiring for this legislative aide position that I took,
                    the Congressman was also hiring two other assistants, more substantive, higher
                    ranking assistants. He hired two guys for those jobs and me as the legislative
                    aide. As it turned, as I later found out, I had about equal qualifications.
                    However, even if I had known about the higher-level openings, I probably
                    wouldn't have had the nerve to apply for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The Congressman's Washington staff worked mainly in two different areas, under
                    the direction of a spectacular executive assistant who had been with the
                    Congressman for many years. One area was the assistance constituents needed in
                    dealing with the governmenprimarily veterans' affairs and Social Security
                    problems. A couple of very experienced and capable women handled that side. They
                    had been doing this kind of work for years and really knew their stuff. I was on
                    the legislative side and responded to inquiries that came to the congressman's
                    office from people who wanted to track bills going through the system or were
                    lobbying on behalf of one piece of legislation or another. An awful lot of these
                    constituent letters were part of organized mass mailing campaigns on behalf of
                    legislation dealing with animal rights or Medicare coverage for chiropractic
                    services, things like that. I came to think that the American system of
                    government was, in a way, democracy by deception. People seemed to have this
                    simplified notion of bills coming before Congress and being handled the way you
                    learn in your textbooks and not realizing that there's a lot behind a piece of
                    legislation in terms of how it gets through the system, and that most
                    legislative proposals don't go anywhere at all. Some of my work in handling the
                    legislative correspondence was quite routine, but I appreciated the occasional
                    opportunities to explain in some substance how the legislative system
                    worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Congressman's primary concerns on the

                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I guess it was probably the foreign assistance program because he worked
                    a lot with a Mr. Matt Harvey, who headed the Congressional liaison office for
                    USAID. Since I was on the Congressman's personal staff, I didn't have
                    responsibilities or opportunities to get involved in the foreign affairs side of
                    things. I was fortunate to meet Mr. Harvey because I later went to work for him
                    at USAID.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Vietnam War protests at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Opposition to the Vietnam War was becoming more and more widespread. It
                    was no longer a hippie kind of thing but was becoming more mainstream.
                    Congressman Mailliard was a Republican, President Nixon was in the White House,
                    the Congressman supported the Nixon Administration, including its Vietnam War
                    policies. At one point, there was a major anti-war demonstration of some sort
                    taking place in Washington and one of the anti-war groups was trying to get
                    congressional staffers to sign on to war protest statements. By that time, I was
                    an opponent of the Vietnam War and I was going to sign onto the statement. But
                    they wanted me to identify myself as working for this particular congressman
                    and, given his position, of course I couldn't agree to do so. That was a little
                    bit of a dilemma. I was sorry not to be able to sign onto it, but at the same
                    time I couldn't bring the congressman's name into it. But here's a twist. The
                    congressman at the time lived in Georgetown, in a large, beautiful home. It
                    turns out that some anti-war protestors floating through the streets of
                    Georgetown needed a place to stay, and the congressman's wife put them up in
                    their house. The protestors probably never knew that they were staying at the
                    home of a Republican congressman who supported the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You later worked for USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, I left the Congressman's office and went to work for Matt Harvey in
                    Congressional Liaison at USAID for about two and a half years as his “special
                    assistant.” I appreciated the opportunity to work for him; it was certainly a
                    step upward in rank and pay, but sometimes there was less to the job than met
                    the eye. There were many frustrating days when I just didn't have serious work
                    to do. My main responsibility came at the end of each week, when I was to write
                    and circulate a report on that week's legislative activities related to USAID.
                    This meant that, during the course of the week, I was free to attend and
                    expected to attend committee hearings and House and Senate floor debates and so
                    forth related to the foreign assistance program, plus I gleaned information from
                    the various legislative affairs officers on the staff. That part of the job I
                    loved, and I wrote good reports. Before long, I had a pretty good distribution
                    list for that report, and a number of people asked to be added to the list. I
                    think these kinds of reports are very standardized by now and probably go
                    through a lot of clearances before they're distributed. I didn't have to clear
                    my reports with anybody except my boss. But that was the bulk of my work. When
                    things were busy on the Hill, it was great. If there wasn't anything happening
                    on the Hill, it could be deathly dull and quiet at times.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I did to get to hear some interesting debates about foreign assistance. At one
                    point, the foreign aid bill was up for a vote in the Senate. It had been debated
                    all week, with a lot of criticism heaped on the bill. The actual vote didn't
                    come until the Friday and, Congress being a “Tuesday-Thursday club,” a lot
                    Senators had already left for the weekend by the time the vote came up on
                    Friday. The debate had not been going well. There was a lot of criticism of AID
                    at the time, in part because of the Vietnam War connection plus because of the
                    public security programs. So there was a lot of skepticism of about what foreign
                    assistance could accomplish and how it was being run. At one point on the Friday
                    my boss came in and sat down next to me in the gallery of the Senate and asked
                    how it was going. I told him I didn't think it was going well at all, that
                    Senator Kennedy and other aid supporters were absent, that the debate had been
                    so critical. As it turned out, the bill was defeated. It was voted down to
                    everyone's surprise. I don't think even the critics expected actually to defeat
                    the foreign aid bill. The Senate later found some procedural mechanism to bring
                    it back for a vote and went ahead and passed it.</p>
                <p>There was another very striking event around that time. At one point, there was a
                    major debate in the House of Representatives over legislation pertaining to the
                    Vietnam War. I was able to attend in the gallery and listened to a good part of
                    the debate. For a fairly lengthy period, the House was practically full, with
                    Members sitting in their seats and actually listening to the debate. You seldom
                    saw that happen. It was a real discussion, with Members seriously paying
                    attention and listening to what everyone had to say, and the debate went on and
                    on. By that time, I had attended a lot of sessions of Congress, of both the
                    Senate and the House of Representatives, and this one was highly unusual, a rare
                    event. In retrospect, I think it was a reflection of how pervasive the Vietnam
                    War issue was becoming.</p>
                <p>Another of the main issues at the time regarding foreign assistance was the USAID
                    police training program. AID used to run police training and I believe it was
                    done in Vietnam, Argentina, elsewhere, and it became extremely controversial
                    because of abuses committed, or thought to have been committed, by the
                    recipients of the training under repressive regimes. It was about that time or
                    shortly afterward that the legislative restrictions were enacted to preclude AID
                    from doing police training. I think only in the last several years has AID been
                    able to get back into that field at all, and in only a very limited way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Working at AID, did you come aware of the divide between
                        AID and the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, at least I certainly felt like I worked for AID and certainly didn't
                    feel that I had any connection with the State Department at all. I was working
                    in the Main State building, in the old section, but I certainly never felt that
                    I had a connection with the State Department. I don't recall my AID colleagues
                    referring to State Department colleagues in anyway or having any particular
                    interchange with them, which may be telling in itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>In any event, I did still want to get into the Foreign Service. As I mentioned, I
                    had taken the exam earlier and had not passed the oral exam part. I knew I could
                    take it again, so I did so a couple of years after the first try. Again, I
                    passed the written but not the oral part. In both of those oral exams, the panel
                    members had suggested some things I should do to enhance by chances of joining
                    the Foreign Service. One panel recommended that I read the journal “Foreign
                    Policy” regularly. They recommend that I travel overseas and that I visit an
                    American Embassy. I didn't tell them about my Luxembourg experience back in
                    1968. So, I proceeded to do those things. I subscribed to Foreign Policy, and I
                    read it. When I visited Spain as a tourist, I went to the U.S. Embassy in Madrid
                    and asked for an appointment with a Foreign Service officer because I was
                    interested in the Foreign Service as a career.They let me speak to a consular
                    officer who was perplexed as to why I was there but kindly spoke with me for a
                    few minutes. I'm sure she was too busy for this sort of thing. Anyway, I did
                    these things and checked these boxes. Then, I went through the exam process yet
                    again in 1971 or 1972. Again I passed the written exam. At the oral exam, about
                    halfway through it, for some reason I had the feeling that I was going to pass;
                    I don't know what gave me that sense, because I can't say that I was doing
                    brilliantly, that's for sure. We got to the end of the interview, and the panel
                    asked if I had anything more I wanted to say. I said, well, this is now my third
                    try and I've done what the other panels suggested to me to prepare for the
                    Foreign Service. I really felt like I'd done what I need to do and would really
                    like to join. Actually, when I mentioned that I'd subscribed to the “Foreign
                    Policy” journal, as recommended, one of the interviewers allowed as how he'd
                    never found it all that helpful. Anyway, I went off and waited for their
                    verdict. When they called me back in, they said that I still had not done all
                    that well on the oral interview, but they appreciated what I had done to try to
                    prepare for the Foreign Service. They recognized my commitment and, realizing
                    that the Foreign Service needed different kinds of people, they welcomed me in.
                    As you can imagine, I was thrilled and very relieved. I eventually came into the
                    Foreign Service in November of 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you joined the Foreign Service in 1973. What was your
                        A-100 class like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: This was a wonderful group of people. We had just a wonderful time
                    together and became very close. In the early 1970s, the State Department was not
                    doing much hiring. I think the Department sort of pulled a class together when
                    it could, when it had the funding, and I had the impression that our class was
                    formed pretty much at the last minute. We had a lot of single people in the
                    class, a few of whom got married right afterward joining the Foreign Service.
                    There was quite a variety of in terms of age range because the State Department
                    had just lifted an age restriction in hiring. Until then, the cut-off was 32 or
                    33. That restriction had been removed so there were some officers just over that
                    mark. That was incredibly lucky for me, because my soon-to-be husband, Lawrence
                    Plotkin, was one of them. We met in the A-100 class and got married a couple of
                    years later. By 1973, more women were also being brought into the Foreign
                    Service, and about a fourth of the class was women. Larry and I formed some very
                    strong friendships that we keep up to this day.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Another major change that had occurred in the Foreign Service by 1973 was the
                    practice regarding married officer. Until recently, it had been the case, as I
                    came to understand it, that if a Foreign Service couple wanted to be assigned
                    overseas, the woman had to resign. The State Department simply would not assign
                    a married couple overseas; later on, I heard of one exception to the practice,
                    but it was otherwise pretty hard and fast. I believe it wasn't necessarily
                    required that the woman resign, but it always was as far as I knew, with that
                    one exception. And I understand that this was a matter of practice, rather than
                    formal, written policy. In 1973, the practice had just changed. There probably
                    were not yet many tandem couples as such, but women were coming into the Foreign
                    Service in greater numbers and able to stay and begin to follow normal Foreign
                    Service careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the A-100 course? Was it a good
                        introduction to the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It was very good in terms of giving us background on the State Department
                    and the other foreign affairs agencies. As was often the case, one of the most
                    appreciated sessions was on representational entertaining, how to entertain on a
                    junior officer's budget, which fork to use, etc. But I was kind of disillusioned
                    by some aspects of the course in some ways. There were a couple of guys running
                    it who must have been among the most cynical of Foreign Service Officers. They
                    gave a very negative impression of the Foreign Service. I was surprised and
                    disappointed by their rather devil-may-care attitude and by the fact that they
                    seemed to have a hard time explaining what a political officer could expect to
                    do overseas. They were very vague about how one goes about establishing contacts
                    and made it sound like hanging out with students at the universities was the
                    main occupation. It all sounded a little worthless. So I wasn't very happy from
                    that point of view. Here I'd gone to all this effort to get into the Foreign
                    Service and I began to wonder about what I was really getting into. My first
                    assignment was a consular position, which wasn't exciting, but at least I knew
                    what a consular job was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you headed for your first assignment? What was
                        your “cone”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I was in the political cone. I had been told I might be offered a Foreign
                    Service job earlier if I opted for the consular or administration cone, because
                    the political cone was far more competitive. But I stuck with my first choice
                    and so came in as a political officer. There were four political officers in my
                    A-100 class, the others being men. I think they were all given political officer
                    assignments. I was interested in Latin America at the time, and the normal
                    practice was to be assigned first to a consular position. The Latin American
                    region of course had plenty of those. My first assignment was in the Dominican
                    Republic and that pretty much suited me. I was given some brush-up Spanish
                    training at FSI and went to Santo Domingo in the spring of 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your consular training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It was good and solid but not nearly as thorough as it is these days.
                    There was one quite surprising session on issuing passports for individuals who
                    went abroad for sex change operations, traveling in one direction as one sex and
                    returning as the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Dominican Republic from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It was originally a two-year assignment, but I was dissatisfied with the
                    assignment for a variety of reasons, some of them personal, and I was able to
                    curtail the assignment to 18 months. I went in the spring of 1974 and departed
                    in November 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation there when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The President was Joaquin Balaguer, who served as president during
                    several different periods over a period of years. Though I don't recall the
                    details, there was political unrest in the country just at the time I arrived
                    and there had been demonstrations where violence occurred. This meant that, the
                    first few days I was in the country, I had to stick close to the rather drab
                    temporary apartment I was assigned to, so it was an inauspicious start to my
                    first overseas assignment. Things were pretty well closed down for a while
                    because of the political atmosphere. Later, during my first year in Santo
                    Domingo, the head of the USIA office was taken hostage and held for several
                    weeks. She was very game about it all, it seemed, and came out of it
                    alright.</p>
                <p>Economically, the country was in dire straights, as I expect it still is. There
                    was widespread poverty, unemployment was high, economic prospects for the youth
                    were poor. Santo Domingo was one of the “visa mills”, so the workload at the
                    consulate was very heavy and demanding. People were very anxious to get to the
                    United States, one way or another, and the visa lines were long. There was a
                    high rate of fraud. You had to expect that applicants would lie to you. It was a
                    very uncomfortable situation and very difficult work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is always a difficult job for a young American who
                        has probably never been lied to blatantly. Did you have a problem dealing
                        with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HANSEN: I sure did. I think most of the junior officers did. The Consular Section
                    was set up so that we would rotate among different kinds of consular
                    wornon-immigrant visas, immigrant visas, US Citizen Services. My first
                    assignment was on the non-immigrant visa line. After the first day there, I
                    honestly thought I could never go back and do it again. It felt impossible. I
                    went back the next day and got through it, and by the end of the week, I was
                    falling into the pattern of it. It was a really terrible job and, yes, people
                    did lie to you. They were so anxious to get visas. The consular officers became
                    known in the country, and people would stop you in the street or on the beach to
                    make a pitch about their visa problems. At the end of my tour, at the airport on
                    my way out, someone raised a visa issue with. It sometimes got to you. I'm sure
                    I had never lost my temper before like a did with some of those visa applicants.
                    On the other hand, Julio Iglesias came through the visa line one day, so there
                    were compensations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did an interview work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: On the non-immigrant visa line, we had three or four visa windows, like
                    bank tellers, and a kind of cattle shoot funneling the applicants up to the
                    windows. The waiting line was under cover but otherwise open-air. There were
                    local guards outside but really very minimal security. One applicant opened his
                    briefcase in front of me, just to extract some papers, and there was a
                    pearl-handled revolver inside. The applicant would have his passport and his
                    visa application form and whatever supporting documents he would bring. You'd
                    have a couple of minutes to talk to him, ask where he was going and why, and
                    especially why he would come back to the Dominican Republic rather than stay in
                    New York or Miami or Puerto Rico. Of course, it was very hot outside, and waves
                    of hot air and odors would come wafting into you through the visa window. It was
                    a very unpleasant experience for both the consular officers and the
                    applicants.</p>
                <p>The local employees were very important to our work. The Dominican Republic is
                    the kind of place where personal relationships mattered a lot, and it helped to
                    know “who was who.” Well, we Americans certainly didn't always know, and the
                    local employees on occasion could tell us that so-and-so was related to
                    so-and-so and helped give us a sense of what the bigger picture was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of supervision were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HANSEN: My very first supervisor was a wonderful gentleman, Don Parsons, one of
                    the best supervisors I ever had in the Foreign Service. I admired him very much
                    at the time and we've kept in touch over the years. He was very good in keeping
                    our spirits up. He took a light-hearted attitude toward the work, but he also
                    took it very seriously. At a Country Team meeting, I happened to hear him speak
                    to the Ambassador about some of the issues we were facing in the Consular
                    Section, and it helped remind me that, as frustrating as the consular work could
                    be, it was also serious work that could give you a good picture of what life was
                    like in the country. that you could get a real picture of the country.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, though, I would say that the Consular Section was quite
                    isolated from the rest of the Embassy. The consular building was several blocks
                    away down the street away from the embassy. However, I think the DCM was very
                    good about trying to keep in touch with the consular officers in terms of their
                    work. One came and sat with us on the visa line a couple of times. Both the
                    Ambassador and the DCM included consular officers in representational
                    events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Dominican Republic while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I traveled all over the country. We were a very close knit group in the
                    consular section, and I got to be close friends with a few other Americans in
                    the embassy and some of the local employees. We traveled all over. Of course we
                    all learned to dance the meringue. One of the popular day trips was to San
                    Cristobal, not far from Santo Domingo, to the residence of the former dictator,
                    Rafael Trujillo, who was killed in 1961. There was a pleasant town, Santiago, in
                    the center of the country, a nice mountain town called La Vega, the town of
                    Sosua on the northern coast that had taken in Jewish refugees during World War
                    II, plenty of beaches to check out. The Dominican Republic is a small place so
                    it was fairly easy to cover most of the territory, though the driving could be
                    hair-raising sometimes. So we saw and experienced a lot, and certainly saw how
                    difficult the life was in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Haiti compare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I visited Haiti a couple of times as a tourist. It was shocking to see
                    the difference. Having been around the Dominican Republic, I knew how poorly the
                    people lived. But conditions in Haiti were far worse, even way back then. A
                    former USAID colleague visited me one time in the Dominican Republic and she
                    wanted to take some pictures of life around Santo Domingo. She especially wanted
                    to get a picture of a horse or a donkey pulling a cart, but she missed a couple
                    of shots. Well, we were going on to Haiti, and she thought she'd get that kind
                    of snapshot there. We got to Haiti, and one of the first things we saw was
                    actually a person hauling a cart in place of a horse or donkey. It was just a
                    miserable place with some shocking things to see, like people living almost in
                    holes in the ground. The situation seemed much worse than in the Dominican
                    Republic, as bad as it was there.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were coned as a political officer. Did you get any
                        feel from your colleagues at the embassy about what political officers were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: A little bit. As I mentioned earlier, I'd become a little disenchanted
                    about the political cone after the A-100 course, so I originally wasn't that
                    unhappy to have gone into a consular job initially. As it happened, when I got
                    to the Dominican Republic, one of the young political officers had to leave post
                    early for some reason, so there was an unexpected vacancy in the Political
                    Section. Although I had mixed feelings about it, I thought well, really, I ought
                    to see if I can get that job because I am supposed to be a political officer
                    and, now that I've seen what the consular work is like, I would just as soon
                    make the switch. By then, I had developed something of a friendly relationship
                    with the political counselor and I thought I could go and have a chat with him
                    about it. But when I went in to see him, he stayed firmly behind his huge desk
                    and it was pretty clear that it was not going to be a very comfortable
                    discussion. I explained my interest in the political officer position and he
                    explained how really they were thinking of developing this position as sort of a
                    “sports officer” position as a way of promoting understanding between the two
                    countries. He didn't quite literally say it should be a guy in the job since it
                    was going to be sports related, but it was pretty clear that he didn't want me
                    in the job, whether because of my personal qualifications or, more likely,
                    because I was a woman. I did not make any complaint about it, but it was pretty
                    clear to me that I was not going to get that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Santo Domingo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I came back to Washington. I really was questioning at that point whether
                    I would stay in the Foreign Service, and it had largely to do with my personal
                    situation. I was still single, and I would say generally that Foreign Service
                    life is not as kind to single women as it is to single men. In the Dominican
                    Republic, I had worked with a number of colleagues who were single professional
                    women. I admired them very much. They were highly capable, very accomplished and
                    cultured, great bridge players. But frankly I wasn't sure I wanted to end up
                    like them. So I returned to Washington in part to reconsider the Foreign Service
                    as a profession. I was going to a job on the INR watch staff, the 24-hour
                    Current Intelligence Staff that worked alongside the Operations Center.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>However, before starting the job, I took some vacation time and, to my great good
                    fortune, made a trip to visit a former A-100 class colleague, Lawrence Plotkin.
                    We had become acquainted when we both joined the Foreign Service and had even
                    gone out on a couple of dates, and we had kept in touch a little bit by letter
                    once we went our separate ways. But somehow, when I arrived in Warsaw where he
                    was assigned, it felt like I had come home. It just seemed totally right to be
                    there with Larry. To make a long story short, I canceled other travel plans and
                    stayed in Warsaw with Larry through the end of the year. Just before Christmas,
                    fortified by a couple of vodkas, he proposed and I accepted. I went back to the
                    States right after New Years Day to visit my family briefly in Illinois, then
                    went to Washington to start the INR job, and Larry and I got married in
                    Washington, DC, at the American University chapel on February 28, 1976. Larry
                    was on home leave at the time and went back to Warsaw after another week or so.
                    I requested a leave-of-absence (leave without pay) to be with him in Poland
                    until he finished his tour there. I stayed in the INR job until July of 1976 and
                    then went to join Larry. By that time, he had transferred to the Consulate in
                    Poznan, Poland, which has since been closed, for the final year of his
                    three-year assignment, so we spent a honeymoon year in Poznan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The year in Poland was very memorable; it was a fascinating experience,
                    though difficult in some ways. Since I was not working, since on was on
                    leave-without-pay, I was free to travel with Larry around the consular district
                    when his duties as Branch Public Affairs Officer took him to Szczeczin or
                    Wroclaw or other cities, and we traveled widely elsewhere in the country as
                    well, including to the town on the eastern border that Larry's family came from
                    originally, Sziemiatycze. This was the mid-1970s, and Poland was in the depths
                    of the communist system. There were food shortages, lines to stand in for the
                    little shopping available, and so forth. We were quite isolated out there in
                    Poznan, halfway between Warsaw and Berlin. There were four officers and their
                    families at the American Consulate. The only other consulate in town was the
                    Soviet, so there was nothing by way of a diplomatic community to provide any
                    kind of cushion. Americans had to assume that all of their conversations were
                    monitored and that they were tracked everywhere they went. We adjusted to that
                    aspect of things pretty well, mainly just by ignoring it, but we were careful
                    not to talk much about personal matters on the telephone or around the
                    apartment. We lived in a lovely, spacious, but poorly furnished apartment in the
                    Consulate itself, upstairs from the main consulate offices, right on a very
                    pleasant park.</p>
                <p>We got to see a lot of the country and to meet a lot of people, especially
                    university types. Although we had some friends among the Poles, we weren't able
                    to get close to many because they felt quite restricted in spending any time to
                    speak of with Westerners. The ones we did meet were very friendly. At least one
                    contact told us that she could no longer see us on a personal basis because she
                    would have to report the contacts to the police, and she didn't want to have to
                    do so.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I had the chance to study Polish a little bit at the university in Poznan. They
                    offered a class in Polish to foreigners, so I attended that class and also
                    shared conversation lessons with a Polish student of English. I picked up more
                    Polish than I would have expected. By the end of the year I could carry on a
                    dinner table conversation pretty well. We developed a real admiration and real
                    sympathy for the Polish people during our stay in Poland. It was a wonderful
                    experience and one I was grateful to have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tandem couples still were relatively a new phenomenon in
                        the Foreign Service, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Tandems were indeed a new phenomenon. We must have been among the first,
                    and we did not at all get sympathetic hearings. When we got married, I was lucky
                    in that I was able to get a leave of absence in order to be with my husband,
                    even if it meant an interruption in my career. At that time the State Department
                    and USIA were pretty ready to give leaves of absence to accommodate tandems but
                    not much else. As a USIA officer, Larry had inquired about cutting short his
                    assignment in Warsaw, and USIA absolutely was not going to hear about that. This
                    was rather understandable, as the request came up at short notice and of course
                    USIA did not have anyone language-qualified to step into Larry's place. Their
                    position was not unreasonable, but the response was certainly very curt. Over
                    time, the State Department and other foreign affairs agencies began to see the
                    advantages of tandem assignments and some reasonable accommodations began to be
                    made. But I think that, just about all along, the notion of one officer taking a
                    leave of absence has been a dominant first choice on the Department's side,
                    rather than going to the trouble to try to arrange tandem assignments
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>When we were getting ready to move on from Poland, we had some trouble lining up
                    a tandem assignment. At the last minute, a tandem possibility did open up in
                    Panama. It came as a surprise to us and would not necessarily have been our
                    choice, but we took the chance. After having served in the Dominican Republic, I
                    was interested in a tour elsewhere in Latin America, but would have chose a
                    “real” Latin American country like Colombia or Argentina, not another country
                    quite so closely involved with the United States as were the Dominican Republic
                    and Panama. Still, Panama wasn't a bad choice. I think Larry may have been more
                    concerned about the weather than anything else, but even that turned out to be
                    okay. I had Spanish already, and Larry was able to get in-country language
                    training, which was quite a novelty. I think USIA showed a bit of flexibility on
                    that score in terms of tandem considerations. I went on to Panama from Poland in
                    July of 1976, and Larry came a bit later, in the early fall. He spent a number
                    of months in Panama studying Spanish, and in the end also spent a few months in
                    Washington finishing up the Spanish training.</p>
                <p>We ended up having a fantastic three years in Panama, from 1977 to 1980. Most
                    importantly for us personally, our first daughter, Anya, was born there in
                    September of 1979.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We were very fortunate to be in Panama at a very dramatic and fascinating time
                    for both the United States and Panama. The U.S. and Panama had just completed
                    negotiating the Panama Canal treaties and there were ratification processes to
                    go through in Washington, DC, in the Senate, and in Panama, through a
                    plebiscite. Domestically in Panama, the country was experiencing something of a
                    political opening to opposition elements. General Omar Torrijos was in charge.
                    Panama had been under his dictatorship for about ten year“ten long years”, as
                    many Panamanians used to say. Our ambassadors to Panama at the time were, first,
                    Ambassador William J. Jordan, and then Ambassador Ambler Moss.</p>
                <p>Torrijos was beginning to open up the political system a little bit, partly in
                    response to U.S. pressure on democratization and human rights and partly in
                    response to a practical need to allow political opening in order to help garner
                    support for the canal treaties in both the U.S. and Panama. I served in Panama
                    as a mid-level political officer. My main responsibilities were to follow
                    domestic politics and human rights issues. This meant that I had the job of
                    building relations with the emerging political forces as well as the old-line
                    political parties that had dominated the country in the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously we were for new parties and all. This must have
                        been, as you say, a fascinating time to watch this. What was your impression
                        of the politicians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The politicians were largely businessmen, lawyers, and journalists. A
                    number of them were associated directly or indirectly with a famous, or
                    infamous, past political leader, Arnulfo Arias. He was elected president of
                    Panama twice in years past and was thrown out of office both times. During our
                    tour in Panama, he was allowed to return after years of exile in the United
                    States. That was a huge event, with masses of people on hand to welcome him
                    back. His nephew, Guillermo Endara, was one of our main political contacts and,
                    some years later, after Arias' death, was elected president.</p>
                <p>These emerging, or returning, politicians were advocating democracy and respect
                    for freedom of expression, human rights, etc., but you had to wonder how they
                    really understood these concepts. In a country like Panama, politics is very
                    much a matter of personal relationships. In such a small country, it very much
                    mattered who was who, and who was related to whom.</p>
                <p>I think the political opening was possible basically because of the other event
                    that was going on at that time, the completion of the Panama Canal treaties that
                    were negotiated under President Carter.At that time, because of the importance
                    of the Panama Canal and because the U.S. Southern Command was located in Panama,
                    with thousands of American citizens living there with the U.S. military and the
                    Canal Zone administration, Panama loomed quite large in the State Department
                    context. Within the State Department, the two largest “country desks” were the
                    desks for the Soviet Union and for Panama. They were about equal size in terms
                    of personnel, so that gives you an idea of little Panama's importance.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The existence of the Canal Zone and the Americans running the Canal was hot
                    political issue in Panama for many years, and there had been violent clashes
                    between Americans and Panamanians in the recent past. Just as we were arriving
                    in Panama, the treaties were being finalized that would allow for the reversion
                    of the Canal Zone territory to Panama and later on the turnover to Panama of the
                    Canal operations. These were enormously important developments for Panama, and
                    they were hot political issues for the United States. So I think the political
                    opening derived from the fact that Panama needed to demonstrate that it would be
                    capable of running the Canal and would be a respectable, responsible country for
                    the United States to deal with on somewhat more equal terms, or at least
                    ostensibly on more equal terms.</p>
                <p>Q: How was the Panama Canal issue viewed in the United States?</p>
                <p>HANSEN: I've just been thinking about all of this again recently. Ronald Reagan
                    has just passed away, and there has been a lot of discussion and analysis of his
                    legacy as President of the United States. But of course he was very active
                    politically before becoming U.S. President, and one of his main issues was the
                    status of the Panama Canal. As I recall, he really played to the issue very much
                    and was a very strident opponent of the Panama Canal treaties. He was very
                    outspoken and helped to make the reversion of the canal to Panama a hotly
                    contentious issue. I think he coined the line, or at least popularized it,
                    saying that the U.S. should keep the canal: “We built it, we paid for it, and
                    it's ours.” I think American sentiment against the Panama Canal treaties was
                    just about as heated and emotional as any political issue I've observed in the
                    United States. Some Americans seemed convinced that the Canal Zone and the canal
                    itself constituted U.S. territory, which clearly was not the case. The original
                    treaty relationship between the U.S. and Panama providing for construction of
                    the canal specified that the U.S. could operate in the Canal Zone “as if” it
                    were sovereign, but it did not grant sovereignty to the United States. For
                    example, babies born in the Canal Zone were not U.S. citizens unless their
                    parents were; in fact, babies born in the Canal Zone had Panamanian citizenship.
                    The Canal Zone had a “Canal Zone Post Office”, not a “U.S.” Post Office; plus,
                    it didn't even have a zip code.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So here's what was happening. The two Panama Canal treaties had to be ratified by
                    both countries: in the U.S. Senate in the United States, and by a plebiscite
                    among Panamanians. In preparation for the Senate ratification debate, many U.S.
                    senators following the issue wanted to come down to Panama to see the situation
                    for themselves because of course they knew what a testy issue it was. Over the
                    course of six months fairly early in my assignment, we had something like 44
                    members of the United States Senate and quite a few U.S. Representatives came
                    down to Panama, either individually or in small groups. The U.S. Embassy had a
                    dog-and-pony show that we set up for them in coordination with the Panama Canal
                    Commission and the U.S. Southern command to try to expose them to all of the
                    issues inherent in the treaties, to answer any concerns they had, and hopefully
                    to win their support. All the visitors had rounds of meetings at the Canal
                    Commission and the Southern Command. Generally they met with Torrijos or someone
                    close to him. They spoke with local Panamanian politicians and with Americans
                    living and working in the Canal Zone, some of whom supported the treaties and
                    some of whom did not. They also were given a helicopter over-flight of the
                    canal. Each of the embassy control officers had a chance to go along on one of
                    the over-flights, which was quite a thrill.The full range of American politics
                    was represented, from Senator Barry Goldwater to Senator Robert Byrd to Senator
                    George McGovern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think the reversion of the Panama Canal the right
                        thing to do?Did you think it was going to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I absolutely thought it was the right thing to do, and I thought it could
                    work, given the long lead time built into the process.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting situations that we encountered relates to this question.
                    As I mentioned, the conservative politician Ronald Reagan was strongly opposed
                    to the Panama Canal Treaty. So, at first, was William F. Buckley, the prominent
                    conservative commentator and National Review editor. Buckley is Catholic, and it
                    turned out that the Catholic Archbishop of Panama was a Panamanian-American,
                    Archbishop Marcos McGrath. Well, Archbishop McGrath got in touch with Buckley,
                    took issue with his opposition to the Panama Canal treaties, and invited him
                    down to Panama to look at the situation first hand. Sometime before Larry and I
                    arrived in Panama, Buckley had visited and had been won over by McGrath, who
                    convinced him, essentially, of the importance of the Panamanian people having a
                    vested interest in the future of the canal and its success. So we had an
                    important political commentator on the right supporting the Panama Canal
                    treaties, in contrast to most others at that end of the political spectrum.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there concern within the embassy, and among people you talked to, about
                    the ability of the Panamanians to run the Canal? One, did they have the
                    expertise to run the Canal, and two, would possible future political instability
                    or unrest in Panama render the Canal unusable?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, those are excellent questions and just the kind of issues that
                    people were grappling with all during this period. I think that most of us in
                    the U.S. Embassy, certainly I, basically supported the idea of the Panama Canal
                    treaties. Support for the treaties was the official policy of course, but I
                    think even personally we thought it was the right thing to do. In good measure,
                    Panamanians were already running the Canal, since many of the canal workers were
                    Panamanian, and we thought there was plenty of time for them to prepare for the
                    responsibility of the canal operations. After all, according to treaty
                    provisions, it would take until the year 2000 for the canal to be turned over
                    fully to the Panamanians, though reversion of control over the so-called Canal
                    Zone came earlier. We felt there was plenty of time for them to be fully
                    prepared to do it. I think the major argument in favor of the treaties was that
                    the best way to protect the Canal in the long run was to give Panamanians
                    themselves a vested interest in it. As long as the canal was seen by Panamanians
                    as an American operation, it was essentially under a potential threat. Once it
                    could be seen as their own, something they are responsible for, something they
                    can benefit from directly, the canal was actually in a safer position.</p>
                <p>One of the U.S. Senators who visited Panama was given a briefing by some
                    Panamanian military officers on the vulnerability of the Panama Canal to attack.
                    He was given a scenario about how easy it would be to lob a missile of some sort
                    into, say, the Gaillard Cut, a very narrow channel in the Canal as it approaches
                    the Pacific Ocean. A simple attack like that could essentially shut down the
                    Canal for months. Though I don't think the scenario was intended as a direct
                    threat, certainly its implication was clear, that the Panama Canal was a very
                    vulnerable operation if it did not have the support of the people of Panama. So
                    I think there was a sense that the safe thing to do in the longer run was to go
                    the way of the treaties.</p>
                <p>At the same time, as you mention, there was also concern among many Americans
                    that, in the future, political unrest in Panama could pose a danger to the
                    safety of the Canal and of Americans living in Panama. The U.S. Senate took on
                    this issue very directly. In the end, the Senate insisted on an amendment to the
                    treaty that constituted quite a blatant change. It was surprising that the
                    Panamanians accepted it. Basically the treaty was changed to provide that the
                    United States could “intervene” to protect the Canal in case of political unrest
                    in Panama. The Senate also inserted an understanding that U.S. military vessels
                    had the right to go “to the front of the line” of ships waiting to make the
                    canal</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>But there was serious concern about potential unrest. As it turned out, the
                    political situation in Panama in fact did deteriorate, and the U.S. had occasion
                    to take advantage of that right to “intervene” some years later. By then,
                    General Torrijos had died in a 1981 airplane crash, and one of his cohorts,
                    Manuel Noriega, had taken charge of the country. In 1989 he invalidated Endara's
                    election as president. So there was a lot of political unrest, the U.S. had
                    imposed sanctions on Panama and, perhaps most significantly, there was the issue
                    of Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking. He was indicted in the U.S. in
                    1988. Meanwhile, in Panama, a group of Panamanian soldiers tried in late 1989 to
                    overthrow Noriega, but they failed. Tension was building up between the U.S. and
                    Panama, and shortly thereafter, Panamanian soldiers killed a U.S. Marine
                    lieutenant in Panama City. This incident together with the drug charges against
                    Noriega essentially gave the U.S. a basis for the military operation in 1989
                    when Noriega was seized and brought to the United States to face drug charges.
                    The treaty allowed us to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the “Zonians” like, the Americans living in the
                        Panama Canal Zone in almost colonial style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: They had a reputation for living a colonial lifestyle, and that
                    stereotype applied in many cases. There were even a few who made it a matter of
                    pride never, or practically never, to step foot outside the Canal Zone except to
                    get to and from the international airport. But I think they were the exception.
                    Still, many did live in a sort of glorious isolation. Others married Panamanians
                    and very much entered into the life of the country. So there was a mix of
                    experiences, it seemed.</p>
                <p>The Canal Zone did give the impression of American life a la the 1950s,
                    approximately, with neat houses and trim lawns all looking very much alike.
                    Between the Canal Commission and U.S. military facilities, you could do all
                    kinds of shopping, entertaining, socializing right there in the Canal Zone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, as an embassy officer, considered the enemy by
                        the Zonians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, there might have been some tension there, but overall I would say
                    no.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, it wasn't a very exciting place to be, but life was very pleasant.
                    It was quiet and family-oriented. Not much was going on by the way of cultural
                    events. A few performers came in occasionally from the United States or
                    elsewhere. We played a lot of bridge and got into a Scots country dancing group
                    that the local expatriate Scots initiated. There were a few movie theaters to go
                    to, either in Panama City or in the Canal Zone. It was very easy to travel in
                    the country, and we did a lot of traveling. Contadora Island was a popular
                    luxury resort island on the Pacific Ocean side. That's where the Shah of Iran
                    stayed for a time after his ouster by the revolutionaries in Iran, as he sought
                    a place to spend his exile. On the Atlantic Ocean side, we visited the San Blas
                    Islands, where there was a much more rustic resort facility, with palm-thatch
                    huts. There were a couple of nice mountain towns to visit, one close to the
                    capital, El Valle, the other toward the Costa Rican border near the city of
                    David. There were a lot of good restaurants, near the embassy and near our
                    apartment which was just behind the embassy. We had a very nice sixth-floor
                    apartment with a balcony overlooking the Bay of Panama. Because of the way
                    Panama is configured, when you look out over the Bay of Panama you're actually
                    looking east. So we would see the sun rise over the Pacific and set over the
                    mountains behind us. You could take a short train ride from Balboa near Panama
                    City to Cristobal, near the Atlantic seaport of Colon. It covered about 50 miles
                    and took about an hour. They called it the fastest transcontinental railroad in
                    the world. We also had the chance to make a transit of the Panama Canal, which
                    took about 12 hours, aboard a U.S. Navy helicopter attack ship, the USS Belleau
                    Wood. That was a very memorable experience. The ship just barely squeezed into
                    the canal locks, with inches to spare. Even with parts of its superstructure
                    folded up and over the deck, it managed to damage part of the overhang from the
                    lockkeeper control building at the Gatun locks at the Atlantic end of the
                    canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the campesino class, the Panamanian people who
                        didn't belong to the elite business and political classes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: There were serious economic disparities in the country. Panama had an
                    unusually high per capita income for a Latin American country, but of course it
                    was not spread out at all evenly. There was an elite business class that was
                    very prosperous and did very well for itself, whether in international banking
                    and commerce or in domestic business. Panama had become an off-shore
                    international banking center, so there were quite a few foreign banks operating
                    in Panama City. There was a very much impoverished urban poor in evidence in the
                    streets of Panama City and even more on the streets of Colon on the Atlantic end
                    of the Canal. Then there were the campesinos out in the countryside. Maybe if
                    they were lucky they would work on a banana plantation run by United Fruit or
                    whatever, but they were not in good shape economically and it was a concern,
                    very much so. The country was very dependent economically, however, on canal
                    operations and on economic activity associated with the American military
                    presence in the Canal Zone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How heavy was the hand of Torrijos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: By the time we were in Panama, Omar Torrijos could pretty much be
                    considered a kind of benevolent dictator. It wasn't a really very harsh rule. It
                    no doubt was earlier on when he first took power. He appeared to be genuinely
                    popular among the lower classes and the poor in particular whom he treated as
                    his base. At the same time, Panama did not fare very well in our annual human
                    rights reports. There were a lot of serious shortcomings, the lack of real
                    democratic practices for starters, the functioning of the courts and so on.Women
                    had some role in political life and there were a few very prominent women.There
                    was quite an active press, some of it supportive of the regime, but it was
                    generally an operation of the business elite. None of it was very responsible,
                    and the reporting was often sensationalist. There was a respectable labor union
                    movement in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you left in 1980?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The treaties had been approved by both countries, by the plebiscite in
                    Panama and by a very narrow vote in the U.S. Senate where a two-thirds majority
                    was required. President Carter had visited Panama in about the fall of 1979 to
                    commemorate the treaties coming into force and the formal turn-over of the Canal
                    Zone to Panama.There was tremendous excitement in Panama at that point, and it
                    was very satisfying to see that outcome. Opposition political parties were quite
                    active, and legislative elections had been held. The former Shah of Iran had
                    come and gone, having spent a couple of months in Panama in late 1979 and early
                    1980, before decamping to Egypt where he died a few months later. His sojourn in
                    Panama, as I understood it, was in good part a result of a close relationship
                    between Gen. Torrijos and President Carter's key adviser Hamilton Jordan.
                    American attention in Latin American by 1979-1980 had in good measure shifted to
                    Nicaragua with the fall of the Somoza regime there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being a tandem couple? This was your
                        first time to work as a tandem. How did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It really worked out just fine in the end. When I first arrived at the
                    embassy in Panama, it was apparently quite disconcerting to some people to find
                    that I continued to use my maiden name after we were married, which was quite
                    unusual at that time. Some people professed to be confused as to whether we were
                    really married and why I kept my own last name, so we had to listen to a little
                    bit of that. But people got over it. Larry and I had very complementary jobs and
                    knew some mutual contacts, as he was the information officer. It was a mutually
                    supportive situation and I think turned out to be a benefit to the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Certainly, when Anya was born in September 1979, we got a lot of support from the
                    embassy. I had no trouble at all getting approval for about two months' leave,
                    most if not all of it sick leave, to stay at home with her for a while after the
                    birth. People were very generous and bestowed on us myriad congratulatory cards
                    and gifts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And after Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: We would have liked to stay overseas if we could have found tandem
                    assignments, but instead we just came back to Washington. Upon returning in the
                    summer of 1980, I took what the Foreign Service Institute used to call the
                    political economy training course, a four-month program which I thought was very
                    well done. It was basically intended to make sure that political officers had
                    the economic background needed to cope with economic issues.</p>
                <p>My follow-on position, beginning in January of 1981, was in the Economic Bureau,
                    in the old East-West Trade Office (EB/EWT) that dealt with trade sanctions. I
                    worked in particular on the high-tech trade sanctions against the communist
                    countries. This was what used to be called the COCOM system. COCOM stood simply
                    for “Coordinating Committee.” This was in international committee based in Paris
                    composed primarily of the NATO countries, minus Iceland and plus Japan, for the
                    purpose essentially of coordinating their high technology tradmilitary
                    equipment, computer systems, satellite systems, other high-end technology or
                    equipment transfer — with the Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc, and China. The
                    American representatives to COCOM worked out of the U.S. Mission to the OECD.
                    The experience in the East-West Trade Office stood me in very good stead,
                    because in almost every job I had subsequently, trade sanctions or export
                    controls were involved in some way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that this entailed an interagency process at the
                        Washington end. What were some of the issues at hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>HANSEN: The United States had a differentiated policy towards the various
                    communist countries, more hard-line against the Soviet Union and China, somewhat
                    more flexible towards some of the East European countries like Poland and
                    Romania at various times, and quite flexible towards the old Yugoslavia.
                    Applying this differentiated policy could be quite difficult, because it
                    involved judgment calls, and especially when “dual use” issues aroswhen a
                    country sought to import computer or other equipment ostensibly for civilian
                    purposes but which could, at least theoretically, be diverted to military use.
                    The issues were seldom clear cut, and there were a lot of interagency
                    disagreements among the State Department, Commerce and the Defense Department,
                    whether in reference to proposed licensing of U.S. sales or approval in COCOM of
                    transfers by COCOM partners such as France or Great Britain. The Defense
                    Department was very reluctant to see much of anything of interest transferred,
                    and the Commerce Department generally wanted to see things go forward. The State
                    Department was often the middle ground, and there were a lot of very contentious
                    cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who headed your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Mr. William Root, a fantastic person to work with, very knowledgeable and
                    detail-oriented, and very supportive of his staff. He had done the job for many
                    years. Others in the office were Richard Mueller who was the China expert and
                    later on consul general in Hong Kong, and Don Kursch, who was East European
                    expert.</p>
                <p>Most of the cases that we dealt with were cases that came up in COCOM. The
                    various member countries would submit to the committee proposed transactions for
                    technology sales to, say, the Soviet Union, Poland or Romania. In brief, they
                    would be asking for an “exception” to a broad ban on such sales. Then
                    representatives of the other member countries would refer to their capitals for
                    guidance on whether or not to approve the “exception request” or under what
                    conditions to approve it. Our office was on the receiving end of that process.
                    We would receive the cases from the U.S. representatives on the Coordinating
                    Committee and then circulate them interagency for comment and recommendations.
                    Most COCOM countries approved the exception requests in a pretty pro forma
                    manner. The United States was the main one to look at the proposed transactions
                    seriously and in detail and to try to analyze them with reference to a recipient
                    country's military capabilities. The Defense Department's role in this process
                    loomed large because, of course, if the Defense Department made the case that a
                    particular transaction was of concern, it usually carried the day. When the
                    United States had to decline to approve a particular exception request or
                    recommended conditions on the sale, it often became quite a contentious issue
                    between the United States and the involved COCOM partner.</p>
                <p>I worked in the Office of East-West Trade until our second child, Alison, was
                    born in November 1981. The State Department was again very generous, allowing a
                    year's leave-of-absence, which we appreciated tremendously.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you assigned when you came back to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: This was not easy to work out and took quite a bit of time. I was
                    nominally still assigned to the EB Bureau but I did not have a particular slot
                    and spent a few weeks in the time-honored State Department tradition of “walking
                    the halls.” In the process of hunting down a job, I came across some really odd
                    little jobs that I never knew existed, things tucked away in remote corners of
                    INR or in the Protocol office. Coincidentally, and luckily for me, it happened
                    that the head of the BENELUX Desk in the European Bureau, Mike Lemmon, had just
                    then managed to create an additional mid-level position to help him out on the
                    desk. I interviewed for that job and started in about March of 1983 for two
                    years. Right afterward, I picked up temporarily as the Norway-Denmark Desk
                    Officer until the summer of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Larry doing during this time, and how did you
                        find it working and having two young children at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Larry was at USIA headquarters in the Arts America office. It was quite a
                    job for us, juggling work and home responsibilities. I remember just being tired
                    all the time, and I'm sure Larry was, too. It was exhausting and even hard
                    health-wise. One winter I came down with pneumonia, twice. But of course we
                    wouldn't have traded for anything.</p>
                <p>We had found a very nice preschool for the older girl in Arlington, and the baby
                    was at first with a woman in home-care not far from where we lived. who took a
                    couple of kids into her home to look after. So the daycare situation was really
                    pretty good, and we were very comfortable with it. But it entailed a lot of
                    tight scheduling and real problems if one of the kids was sick. Plus you always
                    feel guiltguilty about leaving a demanding, high-pressure job “early” at 5:00 or
                    5:30, and guilty for having the kids in daycare at all.</p>
                <p>I was really grateful to a number of people for allowing all this to work. A
                    couple of secretaries in the office were very good and helpful. Mike Lemmon was
                    just wonderful, and I've always been grateful for his support. He put in far
                    longer hours than I did and never complained about my leaving when I had to
                    leave. I did stay late many times when I really had to because of official
                    visitors or other events, but I pretty much walked out the door everyday at 5:00
                    or 5:30 in order to pick up the kids on time. In later years, I tried to return
                    the favor to others, to parents of young children working for me, and tried to
                    be supportive of them in meeting their obligations.</p>
                <p>Q: What issues were you dealing with?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Mike Lemmon had the lead on Belgium and the Netherlands, particularly on
                    political and political-military issues, while I covered the economic issues for
                    both countries and was the Luxembourg desk officer. On the political-military
                    side, the main issue was the NATO missile deployments in Belgium, the SS20s. It
                    was a huge and very time-consuming issue. On Belgium and the Netherlands in
                    terms of the economic issues I was looking after, some involved trade sanctions
                    issues, primarily the COCOM trade sanctions which affected Belgium's trade
                    relations with China. There were aviation issues with the Netherlands, as well
                    as COCOM issues. There were also some trade issues involving nuclear technology
                    for Libya.</p>
                <p>A lot of the work on the desk entailed preparing briefing papers for senior-level
                    meetings and visits. All three countries are members of the European Union and
                    of NATO, so whenever a U.S. official had meetings with these organizations,
                    there would likely be briefing papers needed on the BENELUX countries. There
                    were very close relations between the U.S. and the BENELUX countries,
                    politically and economically. The Netherlands generally was in a race with Great
                    Britain as the largest foreign investor in the United States. With these rich
                    relationships, officials were always coming in for visits and meetings of one
                    kind or another and this was very time consuming in terms of preparations,
                    writing up the reporting cables afterwards, and so forth.</p>
                <p>There were two major issues with Luxembourg, one regarding landing rights in the
                    U.S. for their cargo carrier, CargoLux, and arrangements for a state visit to
                    Washington for the Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. It was the first such
                    visit in 20 years, and I was fortunate to be involved in the planning for it.
                    This was during the Reagan administration, and the visit went very well. It was
                    the only state visit I was ever involved in and had a chance to go to the White
                    House for the arrival ceremony. The Grand Duke and Duchess pulled up in a
                    limousine and were received by the Reagans. I'm sure it would be true for any
                    presidency, but certainly with the Reagan presidency, a state visit was staged
                    like a movie set and everything was perfectly programmed and choreographed very
                    precisely. You had a particular place to stand when you went to the White House
                    grounds to watch the ceremony unfold, and it came off with military precision.
                    We went into the White House after the welcoming ceremony, and went through the
                    receiving line to shake hands with President and Mrs. Reagan, who seemed
                    programmed like robots, and with the Grand Duke and Duchess. A Marine string
                    ensemble was playing. Coffee and pastries were laid out, and we were all in and
                    out of there in about 15 minutes. There was a state dinner at the White House.
                    The Luxembourgers were thrilled with the events overall, and it was all really
                    very nice and impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you say you filled in at one point on the
                        Scandinavian countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, as the desk officer for Norway and Denmark. There was a gap on that
                    desk and I had a few months to fill before starting Serbo-Croatian language
                    training for our next assignment. Even though it was just for a short period of
                    time, it was kind of a kick for me personally to have the opportunity to work on
                    Norway and Denmark, since part of my family background is Norwegian. From Danish
                    contacts I met at that time, however, I learned that most Norwegian Hansens are
                    actually Danish. In either case, I figured I was in good company. Probably the
                    major event that occurred during this five- or six-month period was a visit to
                    Washington by the Prime Minster of Greenland, which is under Danish rule. I can
                    report that I was made an honorary member of Greenland's “Polar Bear Club” for
                    looking after the Prime Minister of Greenland, and I still have the lapel pin to
                    prove it!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you and Larry were assigned to Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: We were assigned to Belgrade. By this time, we had been in Washington for
                    several years and we needed and wanted to go overseas. But we were having a
                    really hard time lining up a tandem assignment. It was very difficult even
                    simply to identify positions that might be available at the same time, much less
                    to compete successfully for them. Part of the problem was that we were dealing
                    with two different agencies, State and USIA, and their assignment cycles were
                    very different. USIA would decide on assignments overseas before the State
                    Department would even begin to advertise any corresponding openings. We had a
                    hard time reconciling the State and USIA approaches. The long and short of it is
                    that we walked a tightrope down to the very end. At one point, we found that
                    there was an opening for Larry to bid on in Belgrade, and we could project an
                    opening for me to bid on that should become available at the same time. Larry
                    applied for and got the Cultural Affairs Officer position. He was assigned to
                    that position by USIA before I could even bid on a corresponding State
                    Department job. It was a very nerve-wracking period. We had tried a number of
                    other options earlier, and they did not work out for one reason or another. We
                    felt a lot of pressure to make this one work.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Larry had his assignment to Belgrade and we were thrilled with that. I
                    went ahead and applied for a political officer position in Belgrade when the job
                    was advertised. As it turned out, I was competing with another tandem officer
                    for that job, and there was a “shoot-out” at the assignments committee. We did
                    both finally did get the jobs and were very excited about it. I have always been
                    grateful to Tom Niles, who was a DAS in EUR, for his help because I think he was
                    instrumental in my getting the position. I did have an opportunity to thank him
                    for it later on. We were very excited about the assignments because Yugoslavia
                    was really a prime place to go in Eastern Europe. It was a very desirable and
                    sought-after posting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the language?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, it was hard. Larry had studied Polish previously at FSI, and I had
                    learned a little bit of Polish. Serbo-Croatian, as the language was called then,
                    is not nearly as complicated grammatically as Polish, but it still was a real
                    challenge. Overall, we had a good experience at FSI, although some of the
                    teachers were better than the others. We studied both the Serbian and Croatian
                    versions of the language but, serving in Belgrade, we really spoke Serbian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for some of the strains within
                        Yugoslavia from the instructors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: A little bit, yes. We had several teachers, most of whom essentially
                    taught Serbian. These included Svetlana Hanaher, who was an amazing teacher,
                    very dedicated and very determined that we would all do well; Father Milosevic,
                    who was a Serbian Orthodox priest, and a Mr. Jovanovic, a very feisty and
                    energetic guy. We had a lovely and particularly effective instructor who taught
                    Croatian, Mrs. Kapolina. The instructors seemed at least on the surface to get
                    along and they certainly put on a good face for the students, but you could
                    sense some degree of tension among them.</p>
                <p>Dr. John Lampe ran the East European area studies program that year and did a
                    terrific job. I really felt that we were well prepared to serve in the
                    region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the same language class with Larry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, there were about eight of us altogether going through the language
                    training program. Eventually we got to the point where they divided us up, and
                    Larry and I were place on something of a faster track, along with Bill Ryerson,
                    an amazing student of languages, who was going to Belgrade as Consul General. He
                    later was the first U.S. Ambassador to Albania, having taught himself Albanian
                    while in Belgrade. To our mutual relief, I'm sure, it worked out well for Larry
                    and me to be in language training together. However, we certainly never studied
                    together at home!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Yugoslavia when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: We served in Belgrade from the summer of 1986 to the summer of 1990. My
                    assignment was originally for three years, but I requested and was given an
                    additional year. It was a terrific four-year assignment, and may have been the
                    last good period to serve in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
                    (SFRY), as it was called then. Inter-ethnic tensions were certainly increasing
                    sharply by the summer of 1990, but the real violence didn't erupt until a year
                    later.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>When we arrived, Ambassador John Scanlan was the ambassador, and later Ambassador
                    Warren Zimmermann. Both had served in Yugoslavia earlier in their careers, I
                    believe. In the summer of 1986, Josip Broz Tito had been off the scene for
                    several years, having died in 1980. Analysts and commentators had generally
                    predicted the break-up of Yugoslavia after his death, but it hadn't happened
                    yet. I think the republics/provinces comprising Yugoslavia were hanging together
                    longer than most people had expected, but the divisions were coming. The
                    Communist Party was still very much in control, but both it and the country
                    generally were very much de-centralized. The Yugoslav military was something of
                    an exception and at that time was probably one of the few institutions that
                    could be described as of a federal character.</p>
                <p>Tito had left in place a political and economic system that, in the end,
                    highlighted and fostered nationalist differences among the peoples and regions
                    comprising Yugoslavia. While he was alive, he managed to hold them together,
                    often using repressive measures, and the governing system had swung back and
                    forth between more and less centralized structures. At his demise, political and
                    economic power was centered in the republics, rather than at the federal level.
                    Much authority had been devolved to the republic level. This meant that, in
                    order for politicians to succeed, they needed to satisfy their people in their
                    republics, and they found that playing to nationalist themes worked to their
                    immediate advantage. When the break-up of Yugoslavia came, it was a break-up
                    responding to these nationalist pressures and sentiments. It was not simply a
                    throwing off of communism and turning to democracy; it was satisfying
                    nationalist goals.</p>
                <p>Economically things were not going well in Yugoslavia. For a number of years
                    before the mid-1980s, Yugoslavia had enjoyed relative prosperity and had shown
                    some economic promise, even as a communist country. By the mid 1980s it was
                    faltering economically, partly due to external circumstances in the world
                    economy but of course also due to the gross inefficiencies of the so-called
                    worker self-management system. With nationalist sentiment building up, people in
                    the various republics also began to think that they were being taken advantage
                    of economically by the other republics. Slovenia thought, for example, that its
                    relative economic success was being used to subsidize the poorer parts of the
                    country (Kosovo, parts of Bosnia, parts of Southern Serbia); Macedonia thought
                    that it was receiving artificially low prices for its natural resources and in
                    turn being over-charged for mediocre goods manufactured in the wealthier
                    republics of Slovenia and Croatia. Everyone saw the political and economic
                    situation as a zero sum game and felt they were getting the short end of the
                    deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>In a way, the American presence reflected the make-up of Yugoslavia. We had the
                    embassy in Belgrade, of course, which was the capital of both Yugoslavia and the
                    Republic of Serbia; a Consulate-General in Zagreb, Croatia; and USIA American
                    Centers in Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Sarajevo, and Skopjthat is, in each of
                    the republican capitals. We did not have an official presence in either of the
                    provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina, which were also part of the Republic of Serbia.
                    This was a substantial American presence in a country of 24 million people,
                    considerably larger than in any of the other countries of Eastern Europe, with
                    the possible exception of Poland. There was a very large Fulbright exchange
                    program for Yugoslavia. All of this reflected the very strong U.S. interest in
                    this communist country that had managed to maintain some independence. It kept
                    out of the Warsaw Pact and out from under the direct thumb of Moscow. The United
                    States invested a lot in our presence in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job, and what piece of the action did you
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I was one of four or five officers in the Political Section, headed first
                    bRichard Miles, who later went on to serve as ambassador to several different
                    countries, and then by Louis Sell, who later wrote a biography of the notorious
                    Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
                <p>I was the political reporting officer for Serbia, including the ethnic-Albanian
                    province of Kosovo, and the human rights officer.</p>
                <p>When we arrived, Slobodan Milosevic had not yet come fully to the fore, but I
                    believe he was already at a senior level of the Serbian communist party. One of
                    the other key figures was Ivan Stambolic, a rival of Milosevic's who was
                    assassinated some years later. There were two major issues that probably could
                    be considered the crux of Serbian politics at the time, the status of the
                    Province of Kosovo and the economic, political, and human rights conditions
                    there and, more broadly, Serbia's standing within the Yugoslav federation.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Upon arriving at post, I was introduced to and began getting acquainted with
                    human rights activists and emerging political opposition figures. After we'd
                    been there about six months, the Serbian Academy of Sciences came out with a
                    major paper about the future of Yugoslavia and its major issues and problems.
                    The first part of it was a fairly straightforward pro-reform paper, in good part
                    dealing with needed economic and democratic reforms. Then it launched into
                    essentially a tirade on Kosovo and the threat they felt that Kosovo, with its
                    about 90% ethnic Albanian population, posed for Yugoslavia and for Serbs in
                    particular. With this document, the Academy helped to popularize the theme that
                    Serbs in Kosovo were suffering at the hands of the ethnic Albanian majority
                    there and were being “forced” out of Kosovo. Kosovo is an area that Serbs
                    considered integral to Serbia as a nation. It carried tremendous emotional and
                    historic appeal for Serbs as the cradle of Serbian civilization, the site of the
                    historic Battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389, and home to the ancient Serbian
                    Orthodox patriarchate. So the tensions that ultimately tore Yugoslavia apart
                    were beginning to come out into the open. They had been present for a long time
                    in other fashions over the years, and at various times they had been held in
                    check by the repressive measures of the Tito regime. Certainly the situation was
                    beginning to deteriorate in the first couple of years that we were in
                    Belgrade.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get down to Kosovo much?</p>
                <p>HANSEN: I did. In my first visit, I had the opportunity to accompany the
                    Political Counselor, Dick Miles, and a visiting human rights officer from the
                    State Department Human Rights Bureau.</p>
                <p>There were a number of individual human rights cases that were of concern to
                    Washington at the time, but the major issue was the treatment of the ethnic
                    Albanian population, particularly in Kosovo and in Macedonia.There, there was a
                    fairly high rate of arrests on what we tended to consider political grounds, for
                    expression of political opinion, usually having to do with the status of Kosovo.
                    At the time, advocacy of a change from province to republic status was
                    understood as codeword for advocacy of independence for Kosovo and ultimately
                    for creation of a “greater Albania” comprised of Albania, Kosovo, and portions
                    of Macedonia and Montenegro. The Serbian authorities, and by extension Yugoslav
                    authorities, interpreted any discussion of a Republic of Kosovo as subversive
                    and as intended to stir up ethnic conflict. In their minds, the Kosovo and
                    Macedonian Albanians wanted the province to attain republic status, equal to
                    that of the other republics of Yugoslavia, which under the then-constitution
                    theoretically would give Kosovo the right to break away from the federation,
                    which would contribute to the break-up of Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did a visit to Kosovo entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>HANSEN: During most of the time we were in Yugoslavia, diplomatic travel around
                    the country could only be arranged via the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry. It wasn't
                    that you couldn't travel otherwise, but your chances of getting appointments
                    with anyone were practically nonexistent without going through the Foreign
                    Ministry and the protocol structures in the various republics and provinces. In
                    keeping with this practice, we flew or drove down to Kosovo and were met by a
                    local protocol officer who accompanied us to all the appointments that his
                    office had arranged at the Foreign Ministry's requesfor example, with the editor
                    of the newspaper, an Albanian-language publication; with Kosovo government and
                    communist party officials, and so forth. On this particular visit, we were taken
                    to visit a large hog-raising farm and meat-packing plant, one of the provinces
                    self-management enterprises. For the most part, our interlocutors were ethnic
                    tandems of Serbs and ethnic Albanians. They seemed to work in parallel
                    structures. It gave the impression that the ethnic Albanians had more autonomy
                    than they probably actually did, especially as Serbia began to try to alter the
                    equation. We were free to raise any questions we liked but the responses were
                    seldom very enlightening. Our interlocutors were always very articulate and
                    always had a good line of gab to feed to foreign visitors. It was sometimes hard
                    to understand what they were really saying, even with an interpreter, because
                    the lingo of the Yugoslav communist system was a language unto itself. It was by
                    no means straightforward.</p>
                <p>Kosovo was a basket case economically. The unemployment rate and poverty levels
                    were high. Factories were operating at far from full capacity. In the capital of
                    Kosovo, Pristina, the shops were poorly stocked, streets were trash-strewn,
                    sidewalks and roads were in bad repair, streets were crowded with overflow
                    pedestrians. There were tremendous numbers of young people, mostly unemployed or
                    under-employed. In decent weather, the evening “korzo” brought crowds off people
                    out to walk the main street through town. The main economic activities were
                    agriculture, a lot of it very marginal, and mining. The famous Kosovo Plain was
                    quite fertile and was lovely in the spring. Kosovars would brag that it had the
                    potential to be comparable to California in food production, quite an
                    exaggeration.</p>
                <p>Kosovo was the least developed part of Yugoslavia and was largely supported by
                    outside budgetary supports from the rest of the federation, which was a very big
                    sore point in Croatia and Slovenia, the wealthier republics that ended up
                    supporting this disaster in Kosovo. While the Serbs remaining in Kosovo were
                    largely an aging and declining population, there was a high birth rate among the
                    ethnic Albanians and, unfortunately, a very high infant mortality rates. I think
                    it was the highest in Europe at the time. In response to earlier unrest in the
                    province, the Albanians in Kosovo had been to some degree bought off by
                    investments in the province financed from the rest of the federation. For
                    example, there was a university in Pristina where students could study in
                    Albanian, but for what? There were no jobs to go to.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>It was a very unhappy situation. The Serbs felt Kosovo was an integral part of
                    their homeland yet they didn't feel safe there. You would hear outrageous
                    stories about Serbian women being raped, nuns attacked. A lot of the stories
                    were probably exaggerations and distortions, but there probably was an element
                    of truth as well. One of the Serbian themes at the time was that Serbs were
                    being “forced” out of Kosovo by population pressures from the growing ethnic
                    Albanian population and were “forced” to sell their property to the ethnic
                    Albanians because the Albanians offered prices they couldn't refuse. Their
                    phrase was migration “under pressure.”</p>
                <p>So there were a lot of ethnic tensions. Another example was simply the way Serbs
                    spoke about Albanians. They often used the Albanian language term for Albanians,
                    which was acceptable to use when speaking Albanian, but when spoken in Serbian
                    it was considered a derogatory term. Serbs used it freely. Generally, they
                    considered Albanians the lowest of the low, perhaps on a par with gypsies, the
                    Roma who were also on the bottom rung in Yugoslav society. It was sometimes
                    difficult to speak with Serbs about these ethnic issues. They were very
                    emotional, very close-minded. They couldn't understand why we weren't more
                    sympathetic to what they perceived as the dangers posed by the ethnic Albanians
                    in their midst.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the embassy about the Kosovo
                        issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Especially in the first couple of years we were there, I would say it was
                    seen as something of a longer term issue. Over time and with Milosevic's rise,
                    it took on more immediacy. We often tried to make the case to our interlocutors
                    that, be treating Kosovo Albanians with suspicion and imposing ever more
                    repressive measures in the province, they were creating a self-fulfilling
                    prophesy. If they were concerned about Kosovars seeking to break away from
                    Yugoslavia, Serbia's handling of the Kosovo issue and treatment of ethnic
                    Albanians only made this more likely. No one was persuaded.</p>
                <p>In the embassy, I think there was a sense that, yes, at some point it could reach
                    a flashpoint. There had been violence in the province in the past and there
                    could be again in the future, but I don't think it was seen as an immediate
                    threat to stability in the region. And in the event, of course, it was elsewhere
                    in Yugoslavia that the break-up occurred and violent conflict erupted initially.
                    But Kosovo was certainly something we understood as a serious matter. Ambassador
                    Zimmerman took on the issue aggressively and tried to convince Serbia to deal
                    more appropriately with the ethnic Albanians, to respect freedom of expression
                    and so on. Prominent Americans visiting Yugoslavia at that time conveyed similar
                    kinds of messages. It was a sensitive thing. Larry may mention in his transcript
                    that the famous writer Joseph Brodsky visited Belgrade, and Larry managed his
                    program. Brodsky met with Serbian writers and other intellectuals and made the
                    case that they had to come to terms with the Kosovo issue with respect for human
                    rights, to no avail. Joan Baez gave a concert in Belgrade, which was attended by
                    a huge crowd. The audience obviously knew her music and loved her, but she made
                    a comment about the Kosovo issue and the temperature in the concert hall
                    plummeted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there any sort of human rights group within the
                        Serbian body politic that was concerned about Kosovo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: There was a semi-official human rights structure and independent human
                    rights groups were emerging. There were human rights activists in Serbia, but
                    they were mostly interested in the rights of Serbs. They were looking after
                    their rights.</p>
                <p>A semi-official Yugoslav human rights structure was taking shape in about 1989,
                    under the leadership of a prominent law professor, Vojin Dimitrijevic. He told
                    me once that, of the committee's 40 members, he was satisfied with most of them
                    but about four were problematic. At one point early in the committee's
                    existence, Rep. Steny Hoyer led a CODEL to Yugoslavia and we arranged a luncheon
                    where he met some of the human rights committee members. As one of his
                    conversations developed, I could sense that one of his interlocutors, a member
                    of the human rights committee, probably held some typically unenlightened
                    Serbian views. I was able to steer the conversation in a direction that revealed
                    them, and in fact he made some derogatory comments about gypsies, for example,
                    and questioned the right of the U.S. or other countries to look into the human
                    rights situation in Yugoslavia. The Congressman was understandably nonplused,
                    and even asked the gentleman for confirmation that he was indeed a proponent of
                    human rights. The Congressman later asked me about the gentleman, and I
                    commented that we seemed to have found out one of the four problematic members
                    of the committee, and now just needed to find the other three. The Congressman
                    got a good chuckle out of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>There was a lot of Congressional interest in Kosovo at the time. I had another
                    very memorable experience when Rep. Tom Lantos and his wife asked for a tour of
                    Kosovo in about August of 1989. Congressman Lantos was very interested in human
                    rights issues generally, very active on human rights issues in Eastern Europe,
                    and particularly interested in the dilemma in Kosovo. That summer, he was
                    spending some time in Bulgaria, where an anti-Turkish campaign was underway, and
                    took advantage of his proximity to Yugoslavia to be driven into Serbia for a
                    visit to Kosovo, and I was his control officer. With an embassy driver, I picked
                    them up at the border with Bulgaria and we drove down into Kosovo for about
                    three days. This was a wonderful experience for me as a political officer.
                    Lantos is a very impressive individual. He and his wife are quite a pair and we
                    had a wonderful several days traveling around Kosovo. Both he and his wife asked
                    a lot of good questions and were genuinely interested in understanding the
                    situation from all points of view. They came with their sympathies for the
                    ethnic Albanians, the underdogs, already pretty much in mind and they certainly
                    didn't change their minds, but they seemed really to want to understand the
                    situation in Kosovo and the relationship between the ethnic Albanians and the
                    Serbs. We just talked and talked that whole long weekend. It was one of those
                    moments in the Foreign Service where everything comes together, and I had the
                    chance to bring to bear just about everything that I'd come to understand about
                    the situation and talk about it to someone in a position of responsibility in
                    Washington in Congress. It was a terrific experience.</p>
                <p>Congressman Lantos was especially interested in meeting Ibrahim Rugova, who then
                    was emerging as a leader among the Albanians in Kosovo. We were able to set that
                    up, and they had a long talk over lunch or dinner at the Grand Hotel in
                    Pristina. Lantos had asked me beforehand what I thought of Rugova, and I said
                    that I thought he was in over his head. After their discussion, Lantos said he
                    agreed with me. As years went on, Rugova continued to play a lead role in Kosovo
                    and was president of Kosovo for a long time. So obviously he grew into the
                    job.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>We also had to arrange for Congressman Lantos to meet with at least someone in
                    the official Kosovo structure, and we did have a meeting with a top ethnic
                    Albanian official, whose wife was Montenegrin. She joined the meeting as well.
                    This official could be assumed to be hostile to Lantos because Lantos was so
                    critical of the regime he represented, but they had a pretty good conversation.
                    I had to serve as interpreter, which was quite a challenge. At one point, the
                    Kosovar official made the comment that human rights are fully respected in
                    Kosovo. Lantos replied, “Would that that were so,” and raised his eyebrow at me
                    as if wondering whether I could manage that phrase. Luckily, thanks to the
                    Serbian teacher at the embassy, I had the exact Serbian translation at hand
                    (”Kamo sreche”) and tossed it right off. As I mentioned, this official's wife
                    joined the meeting, and their ten-year-old daughter showed up as well. Quite
                    strikingly, this multi-ethnic family was making a graphic point about ethnic
                    integration. As the wife said directly, “How could we live here if we thought
                    our own children's rights would not be respected?” Congressman Lantos, I'm sure,
                    was not taken in by any of this, but he responded in a very avuncular fashion.
                    He had the little girl on his lap in no time, and his wife was showing her
                    pictures of their grandchildren. They had something like ten or 12
                    grandchildren, arrayed in a photograph in veritable “Sound of Music” fashion,
                    complete with the white suits and dresses.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that some of the Serb officials were their
                        own worst enemies? Did they come across as very crude, tough guys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: They could, certainly, and they had a hard spot in their hearts when it
                    came to the Kosovo issue, or to relations with Croats and Slovenes, for that
                    matter. On the other hand, they could be charming and lovely. Sometimes I kind
                    of enjoy telling people, when they come down on Serbs generally, that I found
                    them to be a warm and friendly people. They certainly were towards us on a
                    personal basis. Obviously they subsequently earned a very bad reputation for
                    themselves. But we had a great tour in Belgrade, in the old Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it that was keeping Yugoslavia together, as
                        internal pressures were building up and change was coming to Eastern
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Yugoslavia was created originally out of the turmoil of the Balkan wars,
                    the break-up of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, and World War I. There
                    used to be a sense that Yugoslavia's independence and territorial integrity were
                    threatened from the outside by potential territorial demands from surrounding
                    countries. The joke reflecting this was that Yugoslavia was surrounded by
                    “brigama”, meaning it was surrounded by worry. “Briga” means “worry” or
                    “concern” in Serbo-Croatian and, when declined as “brigama,” the word was
                    spelled with the first letter of the names of the countries surrounding
                    Yugoslavia: “b” for Bulgaria, “r” for Romania, “i” for Italy, and so forth. The
                    “m” referred to the Hungarian name for Hungary. The Soviet Union was also seen
                    as posing a potential threat to Yugoslavia's independence and sovereignty. So
                    for a long time, the country held together to resist these perceived outside
                    pressures. During the communist period, Tito and his heirs resorted to
                    repression to keep potential dissident elements under control and to stifle
                    nationalist sentiments that might have threatened Yugoslavia's cohesion.</p>
                <p>By the late 1980s, with Tito gone and with nationalist leaders coming to the fore
                    in the Yugoslav republics, we came to see that the threat to Yugoslavia came
                    less from outside forces and more from internal conditions. There was in fact
                    less and less holding it together. People did not see that they had shared
                    economic interests in the Yugoslav state. They certainly didn't value the
                    country's ethnic diversity, which was so intriguing and charming to outsiders.
                    With the de-centralization in place, there were few federal institutions. At the
                    federal level, there was a weak collective presidency, a rotating presidency;
                    the federal legislature was weak and was under particular attack by the Serbs
                    because their greater numbers in the general population were not reflected
                    proportionally in the Parliament. There was a National Bank, which was also weak
                    and was a focus of hot political debate as to its powers. The communist party
                    still had a federal structure but it was falling apart under nationalist
                    pressures. With the Catholic-Orthodox divide, there was certainly no religious
                    institution to contribute to unity, quite the opposite. The Yugoslav military
                    was about the only institution truly of a federal character, and it was probably
                    dominated by Serbian officers at senior levels. Then, serious economic
                    dislocations occurred due to hyper-inflation. So, there was not much at all
                    holding the country together. I think the system proved very resilient. It was
                    able to absorb an awful lot of tension, and the demise dragged out for some
                    time, longer than might have been expected.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was Milosevic's famous visit to Kosovo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>HANSEN: The visit that purportedly spurred him to take on and use Kosovo as an
                    issue in his political maneuvers was in the spring of 1987. That was when he
                    visited, I believe it was Kosovo Polje, a town near the provincial capital
                    Pristina. There was an incident outside the building where he was speaking,
                    police clashing with demonstrators. He looked out on the scene and made a pledge
                    to Kosovo Serbs, along the lines, “You will never be beaten again.” Then, later
                    on, after he had consolidated his power within Serbia and drained the provinces,
                    Kosovo and Vojvodina, he visited Kosovo Polje again for the 500th anniversary of
                    the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Polje, in June 1989.</p>
                <p>By then, his repressive policies towards Kosovo were taking hold. A curfew was
                    imposed, and there was a ban on group meetings, for example. Larry may mention
                    in his transcript a visit to Kosovo arranged about this time by USIA, for an
                    American art history expert, the spouse of an embassy officer, to speak in
                    Pristina.She drew a huge crowd. No disrespect to her, but I'm sure it was not
                    only interest in art history that created such a large audience. Rather, it was
                    an authorized event that allowed people to come together when they couldn't
                    otherwise. When I visited Kosovo one time myself during that period, we drove
                    through a town out in the countryside and stopped briefly in the town center.
                    Just looking around, we saw four or five different cases in which police had
                    stopped young Kosovar men and were searching them and/or their cars. The police
                    presence became very strong and noticeable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Serb-Croat relations, or Serbian relations
                        otherwise in the federation? Did the U.S. Consulate in Zagreb see things
                        differently from the Embassy in Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: As I've mentioned, there was a general sense among many people in
                    Yugoslavia that their interests, their national interests were not helped by
                    being part of this Yugoslav federation, but in fact were harmed by it. They
                    didn't get out of the federation as much as they put into it supposedly. I think
                    these were distorted views and played on politically. They weren't necessarily
                    correct views from an objective viewpoint, but that was the way a lot of people
                    felt. Particularly in Slovenia and Croatia, there was a lot of distrust of and
                    antagonism towards Serbia. They could easily point to Serbia's treatment of
                    Kosovo and criticize it on the grounds that it was anti-democratic and violated
                    human rights. But Slovenia and Croatia were not necessarily on the side of the
                    angels, except by comparison. Leaders there were also highly nationalistic. The
                    Croat-Serb issue was especially sensitive because of the large ethnic Serb
                    population in Croatia and the raw deal they thought they were getting from the
                    Croats. When the break-up came, the Serb-Croat conflict was a huge element.Just
                    before the eruption of conflict, I had the impression that the Bosnians were
                    almost frantically trying to avoid a break-up, sensing, I think, that they would
                    be caught up in it and suffer at the hands of both sides.</p>

                <p>HANSEN: For the first three years, I was basically covering Serbia, especially
                    Kosovo, plus Vojvodina, as well as human rights issues. In my last year, a new
                    political officer arrived and took over the Serbia and Kosovo portfolio, which
                    was something of a relief to me, frankly. Instead I picked up on Bosnia and on
                    general foreign policy matters. Yugoslavia at the time was a leader in the
                    so-called Non-Aligned Movement, so foreign policy issues were quite important in
                    the relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Kosovo Albanians? Did they

                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: They were of course unable at that time to speak out in any kind of a
                    very frank way. They basically restrained themselves for a long period, for a
                    good number of years until 1999 when the lid did finally come off. In the spring
                    of 1999, the U.S. gave the ultimatum to Milosevic and the air strikes ensued.
                    During all those years, I think the Kosovo Albanians were incredibly restrained,
                    extremely patient with their situation. The situation simmered for a long time,
                    even as the conflict went on elsewhere in the old Yugoslavia and as the country
                    was torn apart.</p>
                <p>I should mention the story of one Kosovo Albanian communist party leader who was
                    prominent during the time we were in Belgrade, Azem Vlasi. We used to meet with
                    him regularly when we visited Kosovo. He seemed for a long time to try to hold
                    things together in the province and to try to avoid the Serbian machinations
                    aimed at undoing Kosovo's autonomy. He made numerous pleas at communist party
                    gatherings. The major meetings were actually broadcast on television, so we
                    could watch what was going on, although there was no doubt even more happening
                    behind the scenes. He finally had to just walk out of the party, as did others
                    from Croatia and Slovenia at different times. His departure was certainly part
                    of the falling apart of the communist party at the federal level. At one point,
                    there was a major strike that went on for months at one of the major mining
                    complexes in Kosovo, with the miners holed up and camping out right in the
                    mines. In “solidarity”, Vlasi went and joined them. He was ultimately arrested
                    at Milosevic's behest and was held in preventive detention for over a year
                    before being put on trial and convicted on some charge. For a long time, I held
                    on to a newspaper clipping with a photograph of Vlasi being brought into court,
                    flanked by two very stern-looking but probably ethnic Albanian police guards. It
                    seemed to me a very ironic photograph.Vlasi passed as a kind of leader in
                    Kosovo, though many ethnic Albanians no doubt would have accused him of being a
                    collaborator for most of his political career, since he went along with the
                    system for so long.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The key ethnic Albanian leader who emerged was Ibrahim Rugova, who I mentioned
                    earlier and who is even now (summer 2004) president of Kosovo. As far as I know,
                    I was the first embassy officer to establish contact with him. He seemed quite
                    weak at the very beginning. If I recall correctly, he was the president of the
                    Kosovo Writers' Society. It must have been about 1988 that you started to hear
                    his name among the “intellectuals” of Kosovo. I know that Ambassador Scanlan was
                    still at post. I said at one point that the embassy needed to start meeting some
                    of these emerging leaders, but it was not easy to establish contact with them.
                    Then we had a congressional staffer visit. I took him down to Kosovo and we
                    managed to meet Rugova. We must have requested this meeting through official
                    channels, though I'm not sure about that. It was a rather stiff, formal meeting.
                    At the end of the conversation, I told Rugova that the Ambassador would be
                    coming down to Kosovo the following week and asked if we could arrange a
                    meeting. He demurred at first, claiming he would be out of town, but then he
                    called me later in the week to say that he would be available after all to meet
                    with the ambassador. I don't have a clue what went on behind the scenes in
                    Kosovo as that meeting was set up, but I expect there was quite a bit of
                    nervousness about it.</p>
                <p>In those initial meetings and subsequently, Rugova seemed always to have to be
                    extremely careful about what he said to foreign visitors. He would keep the
                    radio playing while we spoke, for example, presumably on the assumption that the
                    meeting was being monitored. Of course he never spoke openly about an
                    independent Kosovo. He had to talk around the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Kosovo was far as the schools.
                        Did they have classes in Albanian, or were the Albanians forced into the
                        Serbian mold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I expect there was something of a mix depending on the different
                    communities in province. But there was schooling in Albanian. There was the
                    university in Pristina essentially for the ethnic Albanian community. Some
                    people spoke both languages, though it was more often Albanians speaking Serbian
                    than vice versa. But I did meet several Serbs there who said they were raised in
                    Kosovo and went to Albanian-language schools. I also was aware of Albanians who
                    spoke no Serbian whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we talk about the Balkans, we are really talking
                        about Yugoslavia in a way. What about Croatia, particularly because it was
                        the other big entity in this federation. What were you getting about Croatia
                        when you first arrived, although it wasn't your particular beat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>HANSEN:Of course the political reporting on Croatia as such was done by our
                    consulate in Zagreb. There was something of an artificial divide as a result;
                    obviously the embassy's political reporting needed to be integrated. I don't
                    have particularly insights as to how this was handled by the Ambassador and DCM.
                    At my own level, I don't feel the coordination was particularly strong. I don't
                    think that I had a good sense of the political situation in Croatia, and expect
                    the reverse was also true. It was naturally very easy to be critical of Serbia
                    and Serbs for their behavior regarding Kosovo and relations in the federation
                    generally. But there were things going on in Croatia also that deserved a
                    critical eye.</p>
                <p>I remember when Ambassador Zimmermann first came to post. One of his early
                    meetings was with a Serbian individual who asked for an appointment and came in
                    to talk about what he reported as the maltreatment of Serbs in Croatia. We heard
                    these kinds of rumors and allegations in Belgrade quite often, and it was the
                    kind of thing you would take as part of the litany of Serbian complaints about
                    their victim-hood. But apparently there was at least some substance to the
                    complaints, or at least they reflected to a degree how the substantial Serbian
                    minority in Croatia perceived themselves as being treated. And perception is
                    reality, in a way. In any event, I'm not sure what reporting had come out of
                    Zagreb about the status of Serbs in Croatia, but it was something the ambassador
                    picked up on, in part I think to provide some balance for his exhortations
                    regarding the deteriorating situation in Kosovo.</p>
                <p>The subsequent conflict in Yugoslavia centered in good part around the issues of
                    Serbs in Croatia and Croats in Serbia. I certainly have no sympathy for the way
                    Milosevic and other Serbs pursued things in the years after I left Yugoslavia.
                    But I've always thought that the Serbs did have some legitimate complaints and
                    some legitimate concerns. I don't think that they were very well understood and
                    certainly were not addressed by the international community. The Serbs had no
                    excuse for doing what they ended up doing, but they did have concerns that as a
                    matter of fairness should have been understood and addressed. The fact that they
                    weren't may have contributed to what happened after. Although, as I say, there's
                    no excuse for what the Serbs did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see Milosevic? Was he sort of a rising star
                        when you arrived at post, or was he already seen for what he was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>HANSEN: He'd been in banking, actually, just before or just around the time that
                    I arrived in Yugoslavia. I think he was initially seen as relatively
                    progressive, but that image didn't last long. He was prominent in Serbian
                    politics, and the other prominent figure was Ivan Stambolic, who I think was
                    viewed more favorably liked than Milosevic. As I mentioned earlier, there came
                    to be sharp rivalry between them later on. Stambolic was killed several years
                    later. I believe his body was missing for a number of years until fairly
                    recently the Serbian authorities made some progress in establishing what
                    happened to him. I think that Milosevic was seen as responsible for Stambolic's
                    death ultimately but I don't have a good sense of the details on that issue. In
                    any event, Milosevic's demagogic character emerged pretty clearly over the next
                    few years. I never met him personally since embassy contact with him was at a
                    higher level. For a time there were differences of opinion as to where Milosevic
                    was headed, but his true course was pretty clear well before I left the country.
                    He spoke English very well and was very glib. He was certainly one of those
                    political figures in Yugoslavia who knew what outside observers wanted to hear.
                    They could all spout the right words and could be quite duplicitous. But despite
                    his rhetoric, Milosevic did come to be seen very much as the culprit. One of the
                    disturbing things, of course, was that he did enjoy a degree of seemingly
                    genuine popularity among his Serbian constituents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you turned from Serbia to follow events in
                        Bosnia-Herzegovina? What were you seeing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: During the last year in Belgrade, I worked on Bosnia-Herzegovina. We were
                    seeing Bosnia-Herzegovina as the real crisis point. It was a focal point of the
                    standard analysis we used to give official visitors, visiting journalists,
                    etc.Everybody would ask what would happen if Yugoslavia broke up, because after
                    Tito's death everyone expected that it would. It was in a way amazing that it
                    held together as long as it did. The standard analysis was that, if Yugoslavia
                    were to begin to fall apart, probably Slovenia could break away without too much
                    difficulty. If Croatia tried to follow suit, there would certainly be some
                    violence associated with that kind of move. I confess that I personally never
                    envisioned the extent and severity of the violence, but that was our standard
                    analysis. If Bosnia tried to become independent or break away in some fashion,
                    we always said there would be serious violence. There would be a blood bath
                    because the territory couldn't be divvied up in a rational way among the
                    competing ethnic groups. As the divisions among them sharpened, people were
                    being pressured to identify themselves with one group or another, even if they
                    were from mixed families or had not personal inclination to take sides. In the
                    embassy, I think we sensed that Bosnia was a crucial piece of territory. As that
                    last year went on, there were more and more localized conflicts, political
                    conflicts, not necessarily violent conflicts, but political conflicts across
                    Bosnia, particularly in the Herzegovina region.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The leadership in Bosnia-Herzegovina seemed to me a little on the amorphous side,
                    and perhaps that left room for nationalist leaders to assert themselves. There
                    was a formal set of leadership structures because Bosnia did have its
                    representation in the federal presidency and the federal parliament, and there
                    were corresponding structures at the republic level. Some of the officials in
                    these formal structures seemed to be trying hard to hold the place together,
                    indeed to hold Yugoslavia together. It seemed to me that they knew that, if
                    things started falling apart, there would be serious problems and Bosnia would
                    bear the brunt of it.For a time, of all the republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina and
                    Macedonia seemed to be trying the hardest to hold Yugoslavia together in the
                    waning days of the federation. Certainly, the Bosnians had a lot at stake, as
                    subsequent events showed so tragically.</p>
                <p>Just before the end of my tour, I made two trips to Bosnia in about March and
                    then in the spring of 1990, the second trip accompanying the DCM. We got a sense
                    of real tension even then. Many of the officials we met with emphasized that “we
                    just really have to keep Bosnia together, and keep Yugoslavia together for
                    Bosnia's sake.”</p>
                <p>It's hard to say to what extent Yugoslavs generally had a sense of impending doom
                    at that point. I recall one conversation with some Foreign Ministry officials.
                    One young officer asked about the United States' experience. What would the
                    United States do in these types of circumstances? Well, that was an easy answer,
                    though seemingly not one that he expected. I reminded him that the United States
                    had faced the secession of southern states, and that, as a result, we fought our
                    civil war, the bloodiest war in our history. He became very quiet.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Looking at the overall picture of Yugoslavia at that time, I wanted to mention
                    one particularly interesting and important visitor to the embassy in probably
                    early 1990. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger came to Belgrade for
                    a short visit. He knew Yugoslavia very well, having served there very early in
                    his career.Partly because of the events of 1989, with the fall of communism
                    elsewhere in Eastern Europe, people were agonizing all the more about what
                    Yugoslavia's fate would be. Well, Eagleburger came and wanted to get a sense of
                    what was happening in Yugoslavia. One of the events we arranged for him was to
                    bring in political and human rights figures from all of the republics, and from
                    Kosovo, I'm sure, to have a sort of a round table discussion with him. It was
                    quite a phenomenal evening. They all came to the ambassador's residence and sat
                    in a huge circle around Eagleburger. They each essentially seemed to be giving
                    their rationale as to why their republic or province should be treated in a
                    particular way, and asserting their complaints about their status in the
                    federation. The upshot was that Eagleburger commented as he left, not to the
                    participants, as I recall, but to embassy officers and his accompanying staff,
                    that he just didn't see how they could hold Yugoslavia together. A number of the
                    participants had made in plain that they didn't want to. The Slovenes and Croats
                    were clear at that point. It was sort of like the cards were on the table and
                    you could see how the hand was going to be played out. There was a sense that
                    the situation was grim and would go from bad to worse. It may be that there was
                    so little intent or interest, among the people of Yugoslavia themselves, in
                    holding the country together in a positive way that they only way to do it would
                    have been by repression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other recollections from 1989?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Between the U.S. invasion of Panama, where we had served, in December
                    1989 to seize Noriega and all that was going on in Eastern Europe, we hardly
                    knew where to look. December 1989 was particularly dramatic because there was a
                    lot of television coverage of Panama, and we were trying to follow that
                    closely.</p>
                <p>Then, just before Christmas, I happened to take Anya and Alison by return
                    overnight train to Zagreb to see the Christmas decorations and do a little
                    shopping. With Orthodox Christmas coming later and being a less prominent
                    religious holiday anyway, there wasn't much of a feel for Christmas in Belgrade
                    in December, so I thought we'd try Zagreb, which had a little more to offer.
                    Well, the day we were in Zagreb was just the day that demonstrators and
                    anti-Ceausescu forces seized power in Bucharest and the Ceausescus fled the
                    city. Throughout the day the kids and I went back to the hotel room we'd taken
                    for the day so I could see what was happening in Bucharest. Many of the events
                    and developments of that day were being caught on television and televised live
                    around the world. Yugoslav television had interpreters on duty all day to
                    interpret live broadcasts of events from Bucharest, where the protestors had
                    taken over TV.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>It was just a phenomenal thing to watch. I really don't know what the Yugoslavs
                    made of all this. Of course, they always saw themselves as separate and distinct
                    from the other countries of Eastern Europe, but they must have seen some
                    parallels. For Serbs in particular it must have been interesting. There had
                    historically been a close relationship between Serbia and Romania. I later heard
                    the expression that Romania, for its part, considered its only true friends to
                    be “Serbia and the Black Sea.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go at the end of your Belgrade tour in the
                        summer of 1990?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Before finishing up on our Belgrade tour, I did want to talk a little bit
                    about how our children fared there, to give them their full due. Anya and Alison
                    were young children when we were in Belgrade, aged six and four when we arrived
                    for the four-year tour. I'm sure there were some initial shocks to their
                    systems, and each had a little difficulty initially in settling in to these very
                    different circumstances. But overall it seemed to have been a wonderful time for
                    them.</p>
                <p>They attended the small international school there, the International School of
                    Belgrade (ISB), which kept its doors open during the entire conflict in
                    Yugoslavia and I think is still operating today. They had a wonderful time at
                    that school. It was a very protective environment, they had a lot of good
                    friends, and they thrived. They did very well in classes academically, and the
                    teachers were great. Anya had some chances to do some acting and singing and
                    became very interested in both, the beginnings of her career in theater. She
                    graduated from Northwestern in Drama and is now a stage manager in Chicago by
                    profession. Alison was also into music, singing and piano, and went on to study
                    theater at New York University and now works with an independent producer in
                    Manhattan. In Belgrade, both Alison and Anya took piano lessons from a lovely,
                    elderly local woman, a Mrs. Bach, who taught many of the children in the
                    international community.</p>
                <p>We traveled around the country a lot with the kids. They saw a lot of Yugoslavia.
                    In particular they fell in love with Dubrovnik, which we visited several times.
                    We had a particularly memorable time about halfway through our tour in
                    Yugoslavia. My parents and Larry's mother and aunt all come for a visit at the
                    same time. The whole group, all eight of us, headed out in our two cars for a
                    trip to Sarajevo and Mostar, and then out to the Adriatic Coast to Dubrovnik,
                    then into Montenegro across the Gulf of Kotor, through Budva, and to Sveti
                    Stefan. Then we took the car train from Bar back through all those mountains and
                    mountain tunnels to Belgrade. It was a wonderful trip and gave all of us a good
                    feel for those parts of the country. We still talk about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had three kids and they loved it there. Then we came
                        back to Washington and it was a very miserable time for the children.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>HANSEN: We had a similar experience. The transition back to Washington was
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>There was a very sad turn, though. Living in Yugoslavia, we always felt that our
                    kids were safe. Generally, unlike in the United States, you didn't have to worry
                    if somebody spoke to them on the street or offered them candy, for example.
                    Yugoslavs were just very loving towards children. So it was very shocking, later
                    on, to see that children were so frequently the victims, or even the targets, of
                    the violence that erupted in Yugoslavia. It seemed totally out of the Yugoslav
                    character, as we had experienced it. I have never understood it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you assigned after Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: We returned to Washington, where I had an assignment as the Country
                    Affairs Officer for Romania, the Romania desk officer. I was the desk officer
                    from summer 1990 to summer 1992. Just before leaving Belgrade, I had a chance to
                    make a quick visit to Bucharest. I caught a ride with the naval attach� in
                    Belgrade, who also covered Bulgaria and Romania. He and his wife were going to
                    Sofia by car, so I rode with them. It seemed like a terribly dismal place
                    compared to Belgrade. We spent the night there and then drove up to Bucharest,
                    which was just as dismal.</p>
                <p>Ceausescu was gone, but the situation was very tenuous. Obviously, in Romania the
                    transition away from the communist system proved far more difficult than in any
                    other country of the Warsaw Pact. When I went to Bucharest for that short visit
                    in early June of 1990, the student protest blocking part of the downtown area
                    was underway. They had set up a sort of camp at one of the major intersections
                    and were protesting the course of the so-called democratic revolution thus far.
                    It was not going well. Just getting rid of Ceausescu had not completed the job
                    by any means.</p>
                <p>Ion Iliescu and the National Salvation Front came to power that spring, after
                    Ceausescu was killed, with Iliescu elected president in May 1990. Iliescu, a
                    former communist himself, was not the democratic leader that many Romanians, and
                    certainly not the U.S., had hoped to see emerge in Romania. The students
                    carrying out the demonstration were agitating for further and better democratic
                    reform.Shortly after I visited Bucharest, the demonstration was broken up by the
                    famous miners incident, in which Iliescu's cohorts arranged to have miners come
                    into Bucharest from the Jiu Valley and disrupt the demonstration. It was a
                    needlessly violent event, and it overshadowed American-Romanian relations for
                    several years thereafter. There was a reprise of this scenario in 1991, when
                    miners were again used to storm Bucharest. So the democratic revolution in
                    Romania was very much an unfinished process when I came on to the desk. Deposing
                    Ceausescu had really been more of a palace coup than anything else, and it took
                    a long time for more genuinely committed democratic reformers to come to the
                    fore.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>These were huge developments for our very small embassy in Bucharest to follow
                    and deal with. While I was on the desk, I would sometimes hear complaints around
                    the State Departmenwhy isn't the embassy reporting on this or that? Why isn't
                    there better coverage of one issue or another? But it was quite a small embassy
                    for such a large and complex country. Romania was a country of 23 million
                    people, about as many as Yugoslavia. Yet the number of American embassy and
                    consulate officers in Yugoslavia was easily twice the number in Romania. In
                    Yugoslavia, we had offices throughout the country, while in Romania we were
                    stationed only in Bucharest. The embassy was very thoroughly engaged in
                    following developments in the country and pressing for progress on human rights
                    and democratization, as well as other issues, but it was a lot to cover.</p>
                <p>When I first started working on Romania, the ambassador was a political
                    appointee, Ambassador Alan Green. It must have been a very difficult time for
                    him. I don't believe he'd had international experience to speak of. The upheaval
                    in Romania would certainly not have been something he could have anticipated in
                    taking the ambassadorship. Later, it was Ambassador John Davies, who had lots of
                    East European experience and knowledge of how Washington worked.</p>
                <p>During the whole time that I was on the desk, though there was some limited
                    progress, Romania did not really come to terms with the democratic process the
                    way other countries in the Northern Tier did. Romania was starting from much
                    more difficult circumstances compared to, say, Poland or then-Czechoslovakia.
                    The Ceausescu regime had been sickeningly repressive and had driven the economy
                    into the ground. Its economic recovery had to start from an extremely low base,
                    with seriously deteriorated infrastructure and widespread poverty. Romanians had
                    very little experience in dealing with the West through trade, business, or
                    tourism, since it had been such a closed society. It did not have a community of
                    expatriate countryman, like Polish-Americans, to take a special interest in the
                    country and help it along the way.</p>
                <p>During the Ceausescu regime, we did have a kind of special relationship with
                    Romania for a while, because Romania had been willing to stand up to Moscow to
                    some degree. Romania did not participate in the military operations to put down
                    the Prague Spring, for example. But then Ceausescu became so repressive and
                    turned the country into such a miserable place that obviously that special
                    relationship couldn't continue. It was a very repressive regime at the end and
                    did horrible things to its own people. So, when Ceausescu was gone, everybody
                    was thrilled by that, but those who came into power at first were not of the
                    same caliber and the same ilk as we saw elsewhere in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Working on Romania in Washington was very trying and often very frustrating. When
                    I originally applied for the job, the Deputy Director of then-EUR/EEY told me,
                    in the winter of 1989 just before the revolution took place, that change was
                    likely in Romania, as elsewhere in Eastern Europe. When it came, he said, there
                    is a good chance it will be violent change, but ultimately Romania had the
                    potential for a very rich relationship with the United States. Certainly he was
                    right on the potential for violence. That turned out to be the case. But the
                    “rich relationship” took a good ten years in coming. While I was on the desk,
                    the relationship was at a very low point because of the unfinished nature of the
                    democratic revolution, the people in office in Romania, the agonizing
                    “most-favored nation” trade issue, the adoptions question, ethnic tensions
                    between Romanians and the ethnic Hungarian population of Romania, etc. Iliescu
                    and people around him were, understandably, viewed with great suspicion in
                    Washington. Washington just did not want to deal with him.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we had a steady stream of Romanian officials and political
                    figures coming to Washington during those two years, and they were received in
                    Washington. We kept telling the Romanians what they had to do to improve their
                    standing in Washington, but the reforms in question were difficult and, even if
                    their intentions had been the best, progress would have been slow. Many Romanian
                    officials seemed to think that if they just explained their situation to
                    Washington, Washington would eventually be persuaded. They seemed to think it
                    was a public relations issue, rather than a substantive issue.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Romania managed to get approval for a visit by the Prime Minister. I
                    think he was supposed to meet with the Secretary of State, but at the very last
                    minute the Secretary couldn't take the meeting and it was going to have to be
                    with the Deputy Secretary instead, which was not really the appropriate level
                    for a Prime Minister. But it was the best we could do. (Actually, I don't recall
                    the specifics; it could be that the meeting was originally to be with the Vice
                    President and then passed to the Secretary of State.) The Romanian ambassador
                    called me up and asked, “Ruth, what do you think I should do?” I recommended
                    that they proceed with the meeting because it really was the best we could
                    offer, and so they did that.</p>
                <p>Romanian officials came often to beseech us and press their case. Deputy
                    Secretary Eagleburger and other State Department officials were very generous
                    with their time and met with government officials, opposition political leaders,
                    just about anyone who wanted to see him. Eagleburger met several times with the
                    chief rabbi of Romania. But it was evident that some officials and their staff
                    were uncomfortable dealing with the Romanians, who seemed untrustworthy to them.
                    The relationship was thin, and U.S. assistance was limited to humanitarian
                    assistance and assistance to promote democracy and human rights, though that was
                    quite broadly interpreted, given the needs in the country. Nevertheless, the
                    workload was heavy, and it was a difficult two years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel almost like a pariah within the Eastern
                        Europe office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, I think some people felt sorry for me because I had to deal with
                    Romania and these difficult Romanians, though over time I developed a certain
                    fondness for the Romanians at the Romanian Embassy and elsewhere with whom I
                    dealt regularly. During this period, there was almost a sort of competition
                    between Bulgaria and Romania as to who was doing well on democratization and so
                    forth, since those two countries were viewed in something of a different class
                    compared to Poland, Hungary, and then-Czechoslovakia. In 1990-1992, Bulgaria was
                    ahead. Later on, the tables were turned a few times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did adoptions cross your desk at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, adoptions were very much an issue and were related to the horrible
                    conditions in Romanian orphanages at the time. Right after the overthrow of
                    Ceausescu, the terrible situation of the orphanages and the AIDS babies came to
                    light. The stories were just sickening.</p>
                <p>This set of issues was part of the legacy of the Ceausescu period when government
                    institutions just did not meet the needs of the people and in fact imposed
                    exceptional hardships on them. Ceausescu wanted to keep the population of the
                    country growing, so he imposed a ban on abortions. Abortion was otherwise,
                    unfortunately, a rather widespread birth control method in Eastern Europe.
                    According to Ceausescu, Romanian women were supposed to have lots of babies, but
                    the deteriorating health care system was not equipped to deal with pregnancies,
                    birth, and small children. With deteriorating economic conditions generally,
                    families were not equipped to support their children in many cases.</p>
                <p>I remember hearing a statistic from Dr. John Lampe, during the Balkan area
                    studies course I'd taken before going to Yugoslavia, about the childbirth
                    conditions in Bucharest. He reported that, at one point in the mid-1980s, of the
                    babies born in Bucharest hospitals, only 10% survived. That's how miserable the
                    situation was in terms of health conditions. One of the steps that Romanian
                    doctors supposedly took to treat newborn infants was to give them blood
                    transfusions. Somehow it was thought that blood transfusions were going to help
                    survival rates. Of course they didn't have appropriate sanitary conditions for
                    doing the blood transfusions. Among other practices, they re-used needles.
                    Romania ended up with a lot of AIDS babies that we learned about after the
                    Ceausescu regime was overthrown. They and many other children were placed in
                    orphanages by families who didn't want them and/or couldn't care for them. The
                    orphanages themselves were not supported at all adequately, and so those
                    miserable conditions developed and finally came to light after Ceausescu's
                    overthrow.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>One way of dealing with the problem of these institutionalized kids was to open
                    Romania to international adoptions. All kinds of legal and other problems arose
                    because of questionable practices in selecting children for adoption and in
                    approval of adoptive parents, plus continuing problems in management of the
                    children's institutions.</p>
                <p>Q: How did this impact the desk?</p>
                <p>HANSEN: Fortunately, the adoptions issue was a shared burden because the Consular
                    Affairs Bureau was involved in directly assisting American citizens in the
                    actual adoptions process. They really bore the bulk of that burden. But the
                    issue was always there and was always a topic in official meetings of any kind.
                    Some of the American assistance flowing to Romania through USAID and other U.S.
                    agencies was targeted at the orphanage problem. When the Peace Corps started
                    operating in Eastern Europe, some of the early volunteers served in Romania
                    orphanages.</p>

                <p>HANSEN: Among the main figures was President Ion Iliescu. In May 1990, he was
                    elected President with 85% of the vote in Romania's first fumbling attempt at
                    free elections, and he was re-elected with 61% of the vote in the fall of 1992,
                    in elections generally endorsed by international observers. He had been a member
                    of the communist party in Romania, had fallen out with Ceausescu at one point,
                    and became sort of a dissident communist. Petre Roman was Prime Minister for a
                    good part of the time, and then a technocrat, the former Finance Minister
                    Theodor Stolojan, who was somewhat better thought of in Washington, became Prime
                    Minister when Roman was ousted in that second miners incident. The miners
                    incidents very much colored the way Romania was viewed in Washington,
                    understandably enough and rightly so. Iliescu of course denied that he
                    orchestrated anything but he could hardly escape ultimate responsibility. The
                    first event in June 1990, in particular, was seen as a very brutal method of
                    repression and he was held accountable for it. For a couple of years afterward,
                    officials in Washington couldn't even think of Romania without thinking of the
                    miners coming into Bucharest. It happened again on a slightly smaller scale in
                    September 1991, with the ouster of Roman as Prime Minister, which of course only
                    reinforced the problem. The Iliescu regime was just seen as a regime that
                    Washington could not work with.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The political opposition was very fragmented and ineffective. One of the best
                    organized opposition groups was the ethnic Hungarian party, but it was viewed
                    with suspicion by its Romanian counterparts. A major issue the American Embassy
                    had to deal with was how to get the democratic opposition to work in unity, to
                    be coherent enough to present a reasonable alternative to the forces in power,
                    and to function effectively in a democratic system. The other side of that coin
                    was the need to convince the government to foster democratic conditions of
                    governance.</p>
                <p>On this score, the United States was full of advice and help, though with some
                    restraints on our assistance. Just before I joined the desk, the State
                    Department developed a set of “benchmarks” that Romania would need to reach for
                    normalization of bilateral relations, implicitly including reinstatement of
                    “most favored nation” (MFN) status. The benchmarks encompassed free and fair
                    elections, independent media, civilian control over security services, and
                    respect for human rights, including the rights of ethnic minoritiei.e., ethnic
                    Hungarians and Roma. U.S. assistance was targeted to helping Romania make
                    progress on these benchmarks.</p>
                <p>The issues of ethnic relations were important in Romania and in U.S.-Romanian
                    relations. The ethnic Hungarians of Romania lived mainly in the Transylvania
                    area and generally were very critical of the Romanian majority and the Romanian
                    authorities. They seemed not to feel comfortable as a minority in Romania, with
                    some good reason. There was always tension in Romania as to what the status of
                    the Hungarians should be. Did they have aspirations to break off part of Romania
                    and patch it to Hungary? What were Hungary's intentions in Romania? Hungary and
                    the ethnic Hungarians in Romania had a very effective propaganda machine and
                    were always able to get very sympathetic hearing in Washington, and the
                    Romanians often suffered by comparison.</p>
                <p>The status of the Roma was also an important human rights issue in Romania, as in
                    other East European countries. The Roma were certainly on the very lowest rung
                    of the ladder. Throughout the region at that time, there were sporadic outbreaks
                    of violence against gypsy communities. Somebody in the gypsy community would be
                    accused of stealing something or some other crime and the local Romanian or
                    Czech or Hungarian population would torch a gypsy house or camp or something
                    like that. The authorities would not take action to prevent it or prosecute the
                    perpetrators. These issues were raised regularly in our bilateral relations with
                    Romania and other countries and were included in the annual human rights
                    reports. This was certainly an unresolved question for that part of the
                    world.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Romania was not deemed eligible for the full panoply of U.S. assistance because
                    we were so uncomfortable with the Iliescu regime, but a lot of assistance was
                    provided in democratization. A lot of it came down to how to help the
                    opposition, the so-called democratic opposition. Obviously we weren't supposed
                    to be taking sides in any respect with one political group or another, but as a
                    practical matter I'd say that we did. We were very straightforward and up-front
                    about wanting to see a democratic system in place and see the
                    democratically-oriented parties able to operate freely. The American Bar
                    Association through its Central and East European Law Initiative (CEELI) was
                    very much involved, plus the National Endowment for Democracy and the American
                    political party institutes, the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the
                    International Republican Institute (IRI); the latter had a slightly different
                    name at the time. The Human Rights Bureau in the State Department took a
                    particular interest in Romania. Ambassador Richard Schifter headed the bureau at
                    the time and seemed to take a special interest in Romania. He was the one really
                    sympathetic figure among senior officials in Washington, sympathetic towards
                    Romania. In fact there was quite a lot of tension between the Human Rights
                    Bureau and the Policy Planning staff. They had diametrically opposed views of
                    how to deal with Romania, so there was constant tension there, and the EUR
                    Bureau was often caught in the middle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about MFN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: “Most Favored Nation” status, which erroneously implies preferential
                    treatment in regard to import tariffs, was the somewhat anachronistic term used
                    up until a few years ago to describe nondiscriminatory tariff treatment. In many
                    ways, this was the defining issue in U.S.-Romanian relations, because Romanians
                    interpreted the granting of MFN as a U.S. “seal of approval” and because U.S.
                    officialin Congress and in the Executive Brancused the MFN issue to press
                    broadly for improved human rights conditions. As a result, the MFN issue carried
                    an emotional charge and political value far out of proportion to its objective
                    utility in potentially promoting business and trade between the United States
                    and Romania.</p>
                <p>Post-1989, many Romanians professed not to understand how the United States could
                    have accorded MFN to the notorious dictator Ceausescu yet deny it the “new”
                    Romania. By way of background, Romania was accorded MFN status in 1975, mainly
                    due to Ceausescu's independent foreign policy vis-�-vis the Soviet Union.
                    Romania constituted a chink in the Soviet armor and for that reason was valued
                    by the West in the Cold War context. As Ceausescu's repression of his own people
                    intensified, however, the United States threatened to cut off MFN. By 1988, with
                    the writing on the wall, Ceausescu pre-empted a U.S. move to drop MFN by
                    renouncing it himself in February 1988. In July 1988, Romania's MFN status was
                    formally suspended by mutual agreement of the two governments.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>After the fall of Ceausescu, the United States hung on to the MFN issue, knowing
                    of its appeal to Romania. With little other leverage over Romania, it was a very
                    useful tool for the United States to use to press Romania for genuine democratic
                    reform and improved human rights conditions. Romania's problems in these areas
                    festered. In late 1991-early 1992, finally things began to take a turn for the
                    better. The new technocratic prime minister was in place, and in December 1991 a
                    new constitution was adopted by the Romanian people in an orderly referendum.
                    Under these more promising circumstances, the United States focused on electoral
                    processes as the indicators by which MFN could move forward, and we pressed hard
                    for free and fail local, presidential, and parliamentary elections.</p>
                <p>After successful local elections in February 1992, the State Department announced
                    U.S. readiness to sign a new bilateral trade agreement providing MFN, subject to
                    requisite Congressional approval and with an eye out for
                    presidential/parliamentary elections then anticipated in the spring or early
                    summer of 1992. The trade agreement was signed in April. Romanian authorities
                    ultimately postponed national elections until September, however. This maneuver
                    aroused suspicions in Washington and among the political opposition in Romania
                    that President Iliescu was playing for time in order to enhance his electoral
                    prospects and that, for partisan purposes, Iliescu would try to claim credit for
                    winning MFN from the United States.</p>
                <p>Given these atmospherics, the timing of U.S. Congressional action on the
                    bilateral trade agreement became awkward. First, an early fall Congressional
                    recess, due to coming U.S. elections, threatened to leave the MFN issue by the
                    wayside and to put if off well into 1993, thus diminishing its utility as
                    leverage for Romanian reform. Second, the Bush administration simultaneously had
                    other, heavier issues to manage with a Democratic Congresnamely, MFN for Chinand
                    had little or not political capital or energy to spare for a fight over Romanian
                    MFN, if it came to that.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the President notified Congress on June 3, 1992, that he had
                    determined to waive the restrictions of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment for Romania
                    and on June 22 submitted the newly-signed trade agreement for congressional
                    approval, arguing that it would be good for the American economy and help
                    reinforce political and economic reform in Romania. The House of Representatives
                    took up the trade agreement, with its MFN provision, on September 24. However,
                    at the urging of Rep. Lantos, who actively lobbied against MFN for Romania,
                    partly because of the issue of the status of ethnic Hungarians in Romania, the
                    House postponed a vote until after Romania's September 27 elections.</p>
                <p>In the event, even without the political boost of MFN, Iliescu came close to
                    winning re-election in the first round of voting on September 27. On September
                    30, without further debate, the House rejected the Romania MFN measure 88-283,
                    ending the issue for 1992. Shortly thereafter, Iliescu went on to win the
                    run-off presidential election on October 11.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>By then, I had left the Romania desk, finishing that assignment in the summer of
                    1992. President Clinton submitted the bilateral trade agreement to Congress anew
                    in July 1993, by which time Romania was the only East European country lacking
                    MFN, grouped uncomfortably with a string of pariah states. I understand that
                    Congress approved MFN for Romania on a provisional basis in October of that
                    year, after the State Department acceded to Rep. Lantos' urging to open a branch
                    office in Cluj, Romania, in Transylvania where the ethnic Hungarian population
                    is concentrated. The bill was signed by President Clinton and came into effect
                    in November 1993. The Cluj office opened in January 1994. In subsequent periods,
                    President Clinton submitted reports to Congress affirming Romania's continued
                    compliance with Jackson-Vanik conditions, and its MFN status continued
                    unchallenged. There is more to the denouement of this story, but basically in
                    July 1996 the Congress approved legislation allowing for permanent MFN status
                    for Romania, and it came into effect in August. The issue continued to resonate
                    in Romania in Presidential elections there in the fall of 1996.</p>
                <p>To sum it up, the democratic revolution in Romania was an exceptionally difficult
                    one in the East European experience. That Romania has come as far as it has
                    today, now a NATO member and bumping up against EU membership, is remarkable, to
                    say the least. It's a testament to the people of Romania and to the commitment
                    of the United States and our partners in supporting and promoting democratic
                    change in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Moldova an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: To a degree. I think that some Romanians harbored the notion that they
                    might be able to get some territory that Romania had lost to Moldova after the
                    war, but it never was a live issue, at least from my perspective on the Romania
                    desk. I had the impression that, as miserable as Moldova was economically, even
                    people in Moldova of Romanian background wouldn't have seen a particular
                    attraction in Romania under Iliescu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an active Romanian-American community in the
                        United States? Did they play the role that some ethnic communities do in
                        terms of U.S. relations with the old country?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, there was something of an organization, but it was not nearly as
                    effective as those of other communities, like the Polish or the Hungarian. The
                    ethnic Hungarian lobby was very active and effective, and the ethnic Romanians,
                    if you will, suffered by comparison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1992, where were you next assigned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>HANSEN: As a tandem couple, we anticipated difficulty in lining up joint overseas
                    assignments. As it happens, Larry was not due for reassignment until the
                    following summer, the summer of 1993. So I, in the meantime, wanted to have just
                    a one-year assignment in the State Department so that I could pursue an overseas
                    assignment when Larry was doing so. I was able to get a commitment from the
                    Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, S/CT, for a one-year assignment.
                    When the assignment was actually made, it was for two years. I panicked
                    momentarily but the assignments people said, “Don't worry. The regulations don't
                    allow for a one-year assignment in Washington, but when the time comes, we'll do
                    a curtailment.” Well, I was not at all reassured and felt very anxious that any
                    curtailment request would be denied. Later on, I did have to request that
                    curtailment. To my relief, the assignments officer said, yes, he remembered the
                    commitment and was there to make good on his word, which he did.</p>
                <p>Anyway, my assignment that summer of 1992 was to the Counterterrorism Office. I
                    worked for Jonathan Greenwald. Ambassador Peter Burleigh was the Coordinator
                    during the first few months I was there, a real gentleman in every sense of the
                    word and a pleasure to work for. Subsequently Ambassador Tom McNamara was in
                    that position. I served in S/CT until the summer of 1993. In my section of the
                    office, I was one of several regional affairs officers; I covered Eastern Europe
                    and the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>It seems strange to say it now, but things were relatively quiet on the
                    counterterrorism front during the year I was in that job. Most of the
                    interesting work that I did was in the first six months or so. I was very
                    gratified that, about half-way through the year, I was offered the opportunity
                    to fill in behind my supervisor when he left early for language training. It
                    would have been a great opportunity to step into a more senior position.
                    However, another officer in the section had just been promoted and therefore
                    outranked me. I pointed that out to the office management, knowing that the
                    opening would then go to the other officer instead. I was sorry to miss the
                    opportunity, but objectively speaking, that was the way it had to be.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's hear about some of your responsibilities in S/CT.</p>
                <p>HANSEN: As I mentioned, the most interesting part was at the beginning. I had two
                    really neat experiences. The first was a trip with Ambassador Burleigh to
                    Sweden, and then with Jonathan Greenwald and others to the three Baltic States.
                    We had a system of regular consultations with Sweden on counterterrorism issues.
                    Ambassador Burleigh, who did an awful lot of travel for these kinds of
                    consultations, was going to Stockholm for talks with Sweden, which went well.
                    Iran and Middle East terrorism generally were among the major issues.
                    Subsequently, an S/CT team, including representatives from the Diplomatic
                    Security Bureau and from the CIA, went on to the three Baltic capitals for
                    counterterrorism consultations and to talk about possibilities for
                    counterterrorism training. S/CT had a small budget for this purpose, for
                    training in certain aspects of counterterrorism.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Shortly after completing those trips, almost as soon as I returned to Washington,
                    it worked out for Ambassador Burleigh to have a round of consultations in
                    Moscow. This would have been in the fall of 1993, so it was still early in the
                    post-Soviet period. These were among the first formal counterterrorism
                    consultations between the United States and Russia. Basically I had to organize
                    both of those trips, the Sweden/Baltic trip and the Russia consultations. These
                    were my first visits to the Baltic states and to Moscow, so I valued the
                    opportunities very much.</p>
                <p>In both cases and throughout my year in S/CT, there was a lot of discussion of
                    Iran and the Middle East, particularly Iran's role as a state sponsor of
                    terrorism. The bombing of Pan Am 103 was still an issue, with discussion about
                    who was responsible for the attack and how the issue could ever be resolved.
                    These were new areas for me, so it was all very informative for me personally.
                    In the latter half of my S/CT assignment, it happened that I picked up quite a
                    bit on Iran, though it was not in my specific area of responsibility.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at Eastern Europe and Sweden, why would they be concerned with
                    terrorism?</p>
                <p>HANSEN: It was a matter of nurturing partners in cooperation against terrorism
                    and conveying a sense of what we understood to be the problem in the Middle East
                    and where the terrorism problem was coming from. A lot of it had to do with how
                    European countries would deal with Iran. We saw Iran as behind a lot of what was
                    happening in the Middle East, yet the Europeans were quite interested in
                    business deals with Iran and so forth. We were trying to come to a common
                    understanding with our European partners and with the former Soviet Union about
                    the source of the problem on how to control it through diplomacy, through
                    countries' legal systems, understanding business and banking activities by
                    individuals linked to terrorist structures, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the one year in S/CT, you went into Bulgarian
                        language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, Larry and I had bid on and been assigned to excellent jobs in Sofia,
                    Larry as Public Affairs Counselor and I as Political-Economic Counselor. At the
                    time that we bid, Bulgaria was at one of its sporadic high points in its
                    post-communist transition, so we were very optimistic about the assignments and
                    excited about the opportunity to serve again in the Balkans, under more
                    promising circumstances than at the end of our Belgrade tour. By the time we
                    finished language training and got to Sofia, Bulgaria had slid downward from
                    that high point and shortly moved into a disastrous period of mismanagement by
                    the former communists, under a government of the Bulgarian Socialist Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we going further, let's start with the language
                        training. How did you find the Bulgarian language?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>We were in language training from the late summer of 1993 until the spring of
                    1994. Actually, Larry had to finish up a little early and go out to post a
                    little ahead of schedule. The Bulgarian language has a really interesting
                    historical background, basic to the development of the Cyrillic alphabet which
                    spread widely in the region. At first, I didn't expect to like the language
                    because I'd heard it spoken and always thought it sounded rather unattractive,
                    compared to Serbo-Croatian and even Polish, which I'd come to appreciate years
                    ago. In the end, once I got used to it, I thought that Bulgarian also was a very
                    attractive language. It is probably the simplest of the Slavic languages. It
                    isn't declined, like Polish and Serbo-Croatian, though it has a remnant of
                    declension with the article attached at the end of the word. Pronunciation can
                    be tricky in terms of where the stress falls in a word. The language always
                    seemed erratic in that respect. The other tricky thing was body language. In
                    Bulgarian, as in Greek and Albanian, and perhaps other languages, you nod your
                    head for “no” and shake your head for “yes.” That was hard to get used to, and
                    it was easy to make mistakes. I had thought, having background in
                    Serbo-Croatian, that learning Bulgarian would be quite easy. The similarities of
                    the languages did help at first, but the advantages didn't hold up that long.
                    Learning Bulgarian was still a major challenge. Larry and I were often in class
                    together, and we both did well in the language</p>
                <p>There were several Bulgarian language instructors at FSI; a couple of them were
                    quite strong. One was a lovely and very dedicated woman who unfortunately passed
                    away a couple of years later. Another was a Bulgarian Orthodox priest by
                    training. He sometimes let his understandably strong anti-communist and other
                    political views enter into the classroom. The course of instruction was not as
                    strong as the Serbo-Croatian course had been, though one of the instructors in
                    particular occasionally used some innovative approaches, including the use of
                    broadcast media.</p>
                <p>Once we were in Bulgaria, I found that, even though it had been a number of years
                    since I used Serbo-Croatian, I still would resort to Serbian words occasionally
                    by mistake. If I couldn't think of the Bulgarian word, the Serbian word might
                    come to mind. I used to make the joke that I spoke Bulgarian with a lot of
                    Serbian words, which meant that I really spoke Macedonian. The Bulgarians
                    thought that was very funny, since in their heart of hearts many of them
                    considered Macedonian an artificial language contrived by Tito's Yugoslav
                    regime, and thought that it was really Bulgarian anyway. Knowing Bulgarian, in
                    fact I could understand Macedonian. Once while visiting Macedonia, the Bulgarian
                    president made a statement on TV, and it was interpreted simultaneously into
                    Macedonian. The two versions were extremely close; it was almost like hearing
                    the same thing said twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in Bulgaria from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: From the summer of 1994 to the summer of 1997.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I was the Political-Economic Counselor. We had a small section of five people
                    including a secretary, one of these combined political and economic units. We
                    had a good and cohesive staff. There were a couple of guys in the section when I
                    arrived who had been in Bulgaria for a couple of years, so they knew and
                    understood the situation and the dynamics of Bulgarian political and economic
                    developments really well. A year later two new officers came in who got up to
                    speed really quickly and did a great job.</p>
                <p>The ambassador at first was Ambassador William Montgomery, for about the first
                    year-and-a-half that we were at post. He then was called upon to return to
                    Washington to work on Balkan reconstruction and Serbian reform. After about a
                    six-month hiatus, Ambassador Avis Bohlen arrived and was there past our
                    departure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Bulgaria when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It was not going very well. Over a period of about a decade altogether,
                    Bulgaria had a kind of circular political development in which it would make
                    some progress towards democratic reform and market economics. Then things would
                    fall apart and progress would cease or be walked back. We arrived in one of
                    these downturns in the cycle. The communist system as such had collapsed at the
                    end of 1989, and the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) was formed, while the old
                    communist party re-shaped itself as the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). There
                    was also a key political structure reflecting Bulgaria's substantial Turkish
                    minority, the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF).</p>
                <p>By the summer of 1994 the Union of Democratic Forces that had been in office for
                    several years. They had a kind of a coalition with the ethnic Turkish party, the
                    Movement for Rights and Freedom. Zhelyu Zhelev was the president. This coalition
                    had collapsed by the time that we got there, though the government had not yet
                    fallen. There had been a lot of speculation over the preceding year or so about
                    whether and when Parliament would take up a vote of confidence in the government
                    and thus whether and when there would be new elections. The vote of confidence
                    had been sidestepped several times. Very shortly after we arrived in fact the
                    government did fail and new elections were called in short order. So the
                    situation was quite dramatic right from the start.There had been a lot of
                    skepticism in the embassy as to whether new elections would ever be called,
                    because it would be such a dangerous situation for this Union of Democratic
                    Forces. It was not at all clear that they would do well. By the time we arrived,
                    though, it seemed pretty obvious to me that there was no other way out, given
                    the constitutional structure and the way things were sorting out politically. In
                    the end, new parliamentary elections were held and the Socialist Party, the
                    former communists, won.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>During that period in Bulgaria, political figures all along the political
                    spectrum, despite protestations to the country, had their short-term interests
                    at the fore. Whoever was in office tried to do things for themselves, for their
                    group, and to change the system to their own benefit, not necessarily the
                    benefit of the country overall. This was true of the democratic forces, many of
                    whom wanted basically to turn the country back to the way it was before the
                    communists took power, as well as the Socialists. There was an element of a kind
                    of class division. The old elites of the country wanted to get their homes back,
                    get their farmland back, and so forth. It was understandable that they would
                    demand restitution, but the property issues were handled poorly, especially
                    regarding agricultural lands, orchards, and vineyards, so that there were many
                    property disputes and potentially rich agricultural lands were left to
                    deteriorate. Bulgaria ended up importing a lot of foodstuffs that it should have
                    been able to produce by itself. It had been a breadbasket for Eastern Europe
                    during the communist period, and it lost that capacity. I don't know that it has
                    fully recovered even now. There had been a significant Peasant Party in Bulgaria
                    prior to World War II, and the remnants and new members of that party were
                    components of the Union of Democratic Forces.</p>
                <p>In 1994 there was no consensus as to where the country was headed, and it took a
                    good three more years and a major economic collapse under the Socialists for
                    that consensus to develop. But more about that later.</p>
                <p>In those early post-communist years, although the UDF was to our minds
                    right-thinking in terms of basic democratic principals, economic reform,
                    aspirations to western institutions, and so forth, as a practical matter they
                    were not doing a good job of instituting reform in the country. It was a very
                    frustrating situation. Then, when the UDF finally lost political power, the
                    Socialists came in and tried to turn back the UDF-backed reforms, such as they
                    were. It was a very messy situation, the country just was not making progress,
                    and the economy was suffering as a result.</p>
                <p>All the economies of Eastern Europe went into pretty serious slumps after the
                    communist system fell because all of their structures fell apart and there was
                    nothing really there to replace them. Bulgaria was one of the lesser developed
                    countries of the Eastern Bloc to begin with, and it was less experienced in even
                    a modicum of international trade and international business, so it was starting
                    from farther behind and was worse off than countries like Poland and Hungary.
                    Romania and Bulgaria were at the tail end. They did not do very well in
                    instituting new systems that would let their economies thrive. It was not a good
                    situation, and there really was not a strong clear leader who could create a
                    vision for the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>President Zhelev was a leader among the democratic forces and was president for
                    the first couple of years we were in Sofia. He had emerged from the
                    environmental movement in Bulgaria, where a nascent opposition had been able to
                    function in a minimal way in the latter part of the 1980s. He showed vision at
                    the beginning and was very well regarded by the United States, probably for
                    longer than he really deserved, given his overall performance. Over time, he
                    lost his ability to compel support among Bulgarians. His original mission got
                    mired down in the politics of his own democratic cohort if you will, some of it
                    having to do with personal rivalries and also with the role of the ethnic
                    Turkish party, the MRF. When Zhelev's term was up, he ran for re-election and
                    won only a minuscule portion of the vote. So that reflects how far he had
                    fallen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How communized had the Bulgaria under the old rule? Did
                        they have large collective farms and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, they did. Bulgaria was pretty thoroughly Sovietized and very close
                    to Moscow politically. Bulgaria was often semi-jokingly referred to as the 16th
                    Soviet republic because it was the most loyal of the Eastern Bloc countries. On
                    the other hand, there were no Soviet troops stationed in Bulgaria. There were a
                    couple of ways to look at that. Some Bulgarians liked to say that they were
                    clever enough to keep the Soviet troops out. Others looked at it as a reflection
                    of how confident Moscow was in Bulgaria's cooperation, that they didn't need to
                    have troops there. There was at least one very positive outcome from this
                    situation, in that Bulgaria did not have to cope, as most other bloc countries
                    did, with issues surrounding a withdrawal of Soviet troops. Those were difficult
                    and contentious issues elsewhere, and at least Bulgaria was spared that.</p>
                <p>One way or the other, the relationship between Bulgaria and the USSR was
                    qualitatively different from the relationships of the other Warsaw Pact
                    countries with the Soviet Union. Bulgaria and Russia were close historically,
                    and there were strong cultural links between the two countries. Most Bulgarians
                    speak Russian, and the languages are very close. According to the Bulgarians,
                    and I think it's accurate, the Russian Cyrillic alphabet derived from the
                    Bulgarian. Among Bulgarians, there was no innate hostility towards Russians as
                    there was, say, in Poland. That's speaking historically. Of course the
                    relationship with Russia did get to be very problematic post-1989, largely
                    because of Russia's economic influence in Bulgaria and the operation of Russian
                    criminal groups.</p>
                <p>In addition to agricultural production, one of Bulgaria's main roles in the
                    Eastern Bloc was in the computer field. Bulgaria was home to much of the
                    computer development in the bloc, and its expertise was quite genuine. On the
                    positive side, this meant that Bulgarians were highly competent in applying
                    computer technology to certain aspects of, say, defense reform. On the negative
                    side, for a while you would hear that the “best” computer hackers operated out
                    of Bulgaria.</p>

                    handle well when it came into office post-1989. The slow and ineffective pace of
                    economic reform and privatization was an issue all during the period we served
                    in Bulgaria. Much of the U.S. assistance program was directed toward economic
                    reform, and a lot of it was applied in the municipalities. In some of the cities
                    and towns around the country, it was possible to have some impact, while
                    progress was so slow at the national level.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what were the U.S.-Bulgarian
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Looking narrowly at Bulgaria in and of itself, the direct U.S. interests
                    were minimal, frankly. There was no reason to take a particular economic
                    interest in Bulgaria, U.S.-Bulgarian trade was very modest, and the Bulgarian
                    community in the United States was small. It was one of those situations in
                    which, if things were going well, Bulgaria could easily have been taken for
                    granted. But there was potential for things to go quite wrong in Bulgaria, in
                    which case there could be serious fall-out. So, it's sad to say in a way, but
                    the United States had a sort of negative interest in Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>For example, Serbia, or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), was under U.S.
                    and international sanctions at the time because of the Yugoslav conflicts. The
                    U.S. and the international community generally needed Bulgaria and other
                    countries surrounding the old Yugoslavia to implement the sanctions,
                    particularly to prevent oil supplies to Belgrade. We had a lot of issues with
                    Bulgaria regarding the oil boycott, and the situation was similar with Romania
                    and Macedonia. A gray market and even a black market, particularly in the oil
                    trade, came into operation in the region and undermined the sanctions. These
                    were constant issues in the relationship. A portion of U.S. assistance had to be
                    devoted to helping Bulgaria do what it needed to do, with mixed results.</p>
                <p>The situation was similar on export controls generally. Arms manufacture had been
                    an important industry in Bulgaria under communism, and Bulgaria was part of the
                    network that supplied arms to a number of nations around the world, including
                    pariah states. Bulgaria professed to want to get this trade under control and in
                    line with Western standards, but it had a very hard time doing so, even when it
                    tried. I don't think we were convinced that it always tried. The U.S. worked
                    with and pressed Bulgaria on developing an effective export control system, and
                    we did see some progress there eventually. But given the level of illegal
                    activity in Bulgaria, control over trade in munitions and military equipment was
                    elusive, even with the best of intentions.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) was another perennial issue in
                    the relationship. Shortly after we arrived in Bulgaria, we took our teen-age
                    kids to explore downtown Sofia, and they wanted to buy some cassette tapes. So I
                    gave them the equivalent of about $10, and to my surprise they came back with a
                    handful of tapes, they were so cheap. It turned out, of course, that they were
                    pirated products, so we had to cut out buying up illegal merchandise. Beyond
                    cassettes, Bulgaria was awash in pirated videos, computer software, CDs. As a
                    result, IPR and the “watch list” were major issues on the bilateral agenda.</p>
                <p>Looking at the larger picture, however, the U.S. took a strong interest in all
                    the countries of Eastern Europe in democratic and market reform, improved
                    respect for human rights, defense reform and civilian control over the military,
                    and responsible roles in their relations with their neighbors. We supported
                    their movement towards eventual NATO and EU membership. Bulgaria was very much a
                    part of this larger picture, of building a Europe “whole and free”.</p>
                <p>Much of our political engagement and the bulk of our assistance were dedicated to
                    supporting these goals. As I've mentioned, Bulgaria faced some real challenges
                    in implementing meaningful economic reform. It was also difficult for them to
                    get a handle on judicial reform. In some areas of democratic reform Bulgaria
                    performed quite well. From the beginning, the Bulgarians figured out how to run
                    elections efficiently and well. They were great on the process of conducting the
                    voting in a free and fair manner. They did the job well technically.
                    Unfortunately, the political realities behind the elections meant that the
                    results were not that helpful, because they did not foster the development of a
                    political consensus about the country's direction. The pendulum would simply
                    swing back and forth between the UDF and the Socialists.</p>
                <p>Most of the electoral reform and political party development was helped along
                    significantly by the excellent work of the American political party institutes,
                    NDI and IRI. They did just a tremendous job. About halfway through our tour,
                    there came time for a presidential election, when President Zhelev's term was
                    up. The democratic forces, from which Zhelev arose originally, were having a
                    terrible time agreeing on a candidate to put forward. By then, Zhelev was very
                    much on the outs among the pro-democracy parties. In the end, the IRI advised
                    them on running a primary election, which Zhelev lost. The winner in the primary
                    election went on to win the presidency and served very respectably. It turned
                    out to be a very healthy process for that group of democratic forces because it
                    forced them to work together and brought to the fore a candidate who might not
                    have been considered otherwise. This was quite exciting to see, for the novelty
                    effect if nothing else. As far as I know, it was the only primary election ever
                    conducted in Eastern Europe, though I couldn't say for sure.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Bulgarians were also very successful in another area of democratization, that of
                    forming non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for advocacy and action in various
                    areas of political and social concern. Not to detract from Bulgarians' sincerity
                    or to begrudge them the assistance they received, but international aid funding
                    was quite readily available to support NGO formation and operation, so it was
                    very much encouraged from the outside. Sometimes it almost seemed like a kind of
                    a job creation program, in that assistance supported management and leadership
                    positions in the NGOs, essentially providing income for people who might have
                    had minimal income otherwise. The embassy had Democracy Commission funds to
                    support NGO development. Our funding often was used to equip NGOs with computer
                    equipment. Ironically, this meant that the NGOs we were supporting had computer
                    set-ups far superior to what we had in the embassy, where we were still muddling
                    along with stand-alone Wang PCs. The last year I was in Bulgaria, the
                    Political-Economic Section had one unclassified e-mail terminal, which usually
                    took over a day to transmit to or receive messages from the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>In terms of relations with neighbors, one key issue for Bulgaria was its
                    relationship with Macedonia. To its credit Bulgaria, at the instigation of
                    President Zhelev, I believe, was the first to recognize an independent
                    Macedonia. This was an issue for Bulgaria, because historically Bulgaria
                    considered Macedonia simply to be a geographic territory of Bulgaria, not a
                    separate country, and Macedonians to really be Bulgarian, not a separate
                    national identity. On the surface, Bulgaria accepted the reality of an
                    independent Macedonian state early on. However, for many years there was a
                    sub-text, to the effect that “? but everyone knows that Macedonia is really
                    Bulgarian.” They probably are well past that point by now.</p>
                <p>There were also outstanding issues with Romania, Greece, and Turkey. The
                    treatment and status of Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish minoritabout 10% of the
                    populatiowas occasionally an issue, including in terms of human rights. Towards
                    the end of the communist period, there had been a major campaign against the
                    Turkish minority, requiring that they Bulgarianize their names, among other
                    things. Many ethnic Turks fled to Turkey at that time, so that was a nasty
                    legacy to try to overcome and it took some time. As in other countries of the
                    region, the status and treatment of the Roma minority was of concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: When the Socialists were in office, our dealings could sometimes be quite
                    difficult, as the Socialists at that time were not fully signed on to the goals
                    of integration with Western institutions. Under the Socialists, for example, we
                    had to press the Foreign Ministry quite hard on some UN human rights issues. The
                    UDF governments were more amenable goal-wise, but they couldn't necessarily
                    accomplish everything they set out to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Here's an example that illustrates the very dramatic change that occurred, even
                    over just the short time we were in Bulgaria. Right after the fall of the
                    communist regime, one of the political figures to emerge among the democratic
                    forces was a gentleman named Solomon Passi. He was elected to Parliament and
                    made a statement early on that Bulgaria should join NATO. Few believed that
                    would ever be possible; even some of his own political colleagues were
                    skeptical. Even if Bulgaria decided it wanted to join NATO, would NATO want
                    Bulgaria as a member? Wouldn't it be terribly costly for Bulgaria to join NATO,
                    given the reform and modernization of the Bulgarian military that would be
                    required?Did Bulgaria really need NATO membership anyway? What was the threat to
                    Bulgaria at that stage?</p>
                <p>However, NATO membership, as well as eventual EU membership, was adopted as a
                    basic goal for the democratic forces. Over time even the Socialists came onboard
                    with the idea. Bulgaria has now joined NATO, and ironically a Socialist was
                    president at the time.So in the space of just over a decade, Bulgaria achieved
                    that major transformation in its outlook and orientation. It took a long time to
                    get there and it was quite phenomenal that they could do it. I think the global
                    war on terrorism and the U.S. military action in Afghanistan helped Bulgaria
                    make part of the leap, because Bulgaria made a political decision to support the
                    United States in the war on terrorism. They provided an air refueling facility
                    for American planes flying over to Afghanistan, for example. So, they took a
                    number of very difficult decisions that I think really opened the way for the
                    United States to support their NATO membership.</p>
                <p>In contrast, shortly before I arrived in Bulgaria in 1994, there had been a huge
                    political issue about whether American troops could be supported by a train
                    passing through Bulgaria into Macedonia where we had peacekeepers stationed for
                    a while. It was simply supplies, not armaments or anything. That practically
                    caused the UDF government to fall, when all the parliament had to deal with was
                    issuing approval for a supply train to pass through the country with non-lethal
                    equipment. Ten years later the Bulgarians allowed and supported refueling
                    operations for military aircraft going into combat. That's a real turn-around.
                    It's been very gratifying to see that a country like Bulgaria could make such a
                    huge turn and bring itself around to such a different point of view.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How open did you find the press, and people
                        generally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>HANSEN: It was hard at times. I must say it was hard. We had served the four
                    years in Belgrade and we sort of thought we knew and understood the Balkans. I
                    think we expected to find a lot of similarities between Bulgaria and Serbia, so
                    we were a little bit surprised, I think, by how hard it was, initially, to
                    settle in to Bulgaria and to begin to feel comfortable and get a feel for the
                    country and its people. Things were quite different in Bulgaria, I would say. It
                    was kind of a hostile environment when we first arrived. There was not
                    necessarily a lot of overt, anti-American sentiment, but somehow you just didn't
                    really feel comfortable. You didn't feel like you were being welcomed, although
                    some individuals would be very warm and friendly and some of our contacts were
                    very welcoming. We just generally felt a little uncomfortable. It was a
                    difficult transition for the whole family. Sofia was very run-down in areas,
                    streets were in terrible disrepair, garbage pick-up was a serious problem,
                    stripped and rusting cars decorated our neighborhood where we were housed for
                    the first six months, shopping for food was difficult. Overall, whereas I always
                    would give myself a good six months to begin to feel comfortable in a new
                    country, it took me a little longer in Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>Once we did begin to feel more comfortable, and maybe it was also a function of
                    change going on in the country, we ended up having a wonderful time there. We
                    probably had more personal friends in Bulgaria than we had in any other post.
                    Either we had to change and adjust more than we expected or maybe even the
                    country changed during the time we were there. I think it did actually. The
                    people did develop a sense of self-confidence in dealing with foreigners, so I
                    think there was a kind of change in the psychology of the country during the
                    period that we happened to be there. We ended up having a wonderful time and
                    feeling very comfortable and very much welcomed, but it was hard at the
                    beginning, partly, I think, because we erroneously anticipated that it would be
                    so easy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the socialists conduct themselves while they were
                        in office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>HANSEN: They were in office most of the time that we were in Bulgaria, as it
                    turned out. While some individuals were charming, they could be a very
                    unpleasant group. There was a lot of infighting among the Socialists, and among
                    the democratic forces as well, for that matter. But the Socialists were probably
                    at more of an extreme. It was very factional. A good number of the Socialists
                    never really set aside their communist way of thinking and behaving. It was not
                    a real enlightened group of leaders there, really, on either side. The
                    Socialists were very easy to distrust. There were also a lot of personality
                    conflicts, really very serious personality and personal conflicts, among members
                    of both groups. One key figure in the Socialist Party, who was a major player in
                    the palace coup that deposed the communist regime, was Andrei Lukanov, who
                    towards the end of our tour was assassinated outside his apartment building in
                    broad daylight in a rather ordinary residential neighborhood. An embassy family
                    lived in the same building. The shooting was thought to have been carried out by
                    Russian Mafia business ties. I believe that arrests were finally made and a
                    trial held in just the last couple of years. It was a very brutal set of
                    circumstances. A number of the Socialist leaders were thought to have Mafia ties
                    or otherwise be involved with nefarious business activities.</p>
                <p>At that time, the Bulgarian economy was doing poorly. Of the relatively little
                    business activity going on, much of it was tied up with what was loosely called
                    Mafia circles. There was a lot of gray market activity. As I mentioned, one of
                    the issues at the time was the international economic boycott of Yugoslavia,
                    especially the oil embargo. Bulgaria and the other countries surrounding
                    Yugoslavia always said that their economies suffered greatly because of the
                    Yugoslavian embargo. It hindered their economic development and interrupted
                    their trade patterns and so forth. That was certainly true to some extent. But I
                    think the real damage was in the opportunities presented by the embargo for
                    smuggling and gray market economic activity to circumvent the embargo. These
                    developments further distorted an economy that was already seriously disrupted.
                    Just as the country was trying to move to a market economy, the people could see
                    that so much illegal economic activity was underway and that criminal circles
                    were benefitting the most from the fall of communism. This undeservedly gave
                    market economics a pretty bad name.</p>

                <p>HANSEN: They seemed to have somewhat ambiguous feelings about it. They paid lip
                    service to the general international policy towards Yugoslavia and the position
                    that the economic sanctions had to be maintained until the conflict ended. At
                    the same time, they seemed to feel ambivalent because of the international
                    involvement in the old Yugoslavia. They were not comfortable with such
                    international “intervention”. They wanted the conflict to end but were
                    uncomfortable with outside military action to bring it to an end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you noticing a gap between the young people and the
                        older people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Oh, absolutely. This was a very interesting thing to see in terms of the
                    political development and the various elections that took place. Bulgaria was
                    suffering some serious demographic problems. It's a rather small country, a
                    population of only 8 or 9 million in 1989-90 and declining in population as
                    people emigrated overseas looking for better economic opportunities. There was a
                    dramatic population drain after 1989, plus a low birth rate. So, its population
                    was declining. The youth were generally very pessimistic about their chances for
                    a decent life in Bulgaria, rightly so because things were not looking good at
                    all. They generally supported reform, and the pro-reform parties had a younger
                    base. The older generation was very much of the old communist mind set and very
                    sympathetic to the Socialist Party. At one point in the context of one of the
                    elections, the International Republican Institute did some excellent polling
                    that showed how disenchanted the population was. There was a great deal of
                    disappointment in Bulgaria's progress, or lack thereof, in the post-communist
                    period, and a broad consensus that Bulgaria was not going in the right
                    direction, that people had not reaped the benefits of democracy that they
                    thought would come so quickly after 1989. People evidenced a lot of
                    disillusionment and unhappiness at how the country was faring in the mid-1990s.
                    In fact, many people came to the conclusion, especially the older voters, that
                    they were better off under communism. By this time, the Socialists were in
                    office and part of the reason for Bulgaria's poor conditions was bad government
                    by the Socialists. But the democratic forces were the ones held accountable, and
                    they paid the price for that. They were seen as responsible for not carrying out
                    the promise of reform. In the end, the Socialists benefitted for a time from
                    widespread disillusionment post-1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Socialists deal with all these reform advisers
                        that were coming in from the United States and Europe? Were they
                        dismissive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: They were, and they basically didn't work with the advisers. While the
                    Socialists were in power at the national level, we ended up steering a lot of
                    our assistance to the municipal level, where there was more receptivity. You
                    could often find more pro-reform mayors and local leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the United States seen, then, as in some ways
                        supporting the opposition? Didn't the embassy have to be careful about that,
                        to avoid the appearance of interference in domestic politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: We did have be careful about that, obviously. We always cast our
                    assistance as support for democratic and market reform, and always said we would
                    support those who were committed to working for reform.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>So, as a practical matter, yes, we ended up supporting the opposition in a sense
                    while the Socialists were in office. I think we were pretty successful in
                    maintaining our credibility, however. It was not really an issue.</p>
                <p>But here's a curious example. I mentioned that the democratic forces held a
                    primary election campaign to choose their presidential candidate at one point.
                    USAID to its credit was concerned about the United States being seen as
                    supporting the opposition by advising them, through IRI, on running this primary
                    election. USAID insisted, and rightly so, that the same kind of offer be made to
                    the Socialists, to keep things even. As the Political-Economic Counselor, I
                    volunteered to take on this somewhat unsavory task. So I went and met with a top
                    Socialist Party official; I think it was the chairman of the party. I explained
                    the assistance we were providing to the opposition on a primary campaign, and
                    offered to do likewise for the Socialists. Of course, we were pretty confident
                    that they would decline the offer, and they did. What was interesting was that,
                    later on, several political leaders in the Socialist party complained that we
                    were helping the democratic forces with their election campaign. Fortunately I
                    was able to say, well, we offered the same kind of assistance to the Socialists
                    and we were not taken up on it. It became obvious that word of the U.S. offer
                    had never been filtered down within Socialist Party ranks. The top official had
                    kept it to himself, and nobody else ever knew that we had offered it until they
                    asked us about it. So it was a very good thing to be able to say that we made
                    the offer and had not been taken up on it. Actually, I rather enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>On balance, as mentioned, I think our credibility was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of the Socialists representing a newer generation
                        of socialism in the European sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: As in Social Democrats?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, there were some. There was a small Social Democratic Party,
                    comprised largely of former Socialists, which expanded somewhat while we were
                    there, drawing increased membership from the Socialist ranks. It was a small
                    party and never fared very well in elections, but they were very
                    respectable.There were others in the Socialist Party who I wouldn't call really
                    enlightened, but they were pragmatic enough to make some fairly good decisions
                    and, in fact, at least one very astute decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I'm jumping ahead here, to the last year that I was in Bulgaria, really the last
                    six months. By the end of 1996-early 1997, the Socialists had been in office for
                    a couple of years. They just ran the economy into the ground. There was
                    hyper-inflation and high unemployment. There were bread shortages, really
                    serious bread shortages and shortages of food generally. They were selling off
                    the flour that the country produced, leaving too little for the domestic market.
                    People were in bread lines; soup kitchens were started up, at least one of them
                    supported by the embassy community.</p>
                <p>Then, at about the same timit must have been in December of 1996 - there were
                    major street protests in Belgrade against the Milosevic regime. For I don't know
                    how many days in a row there were major street protests against Milosevic in
                    Belgrade. Some of the democratic leaders from Bulgaria went to Belgrade and at
                    one point took part in the marches with them. They came back to Sofia and
                    managed to pull off something similar in Sofia. For about a month or more, the
                    democratic forces ran massive street protests in Sofia and eventually in other
                    cities, calling for the removal of the Socialists. In Sofia, there was a daily
                    march beginning in the late afternoon and into the evening, through town along
                    the main shopping street, Vitosha Boulevard, to the main square around the
                    Nevski cathedral behind Parliament. These were peaceful marches every day, with
                    rallies into the late evening. Thousands of people participated. At least in
                    Sofia, there was virtually no uniformed police presence. I should clarify that
                    it wasn't peaceful at the very beginning. There were two incidents, one outside
                    Socialist Party headquarters and another outside Parliament, that did involve
                    violence and, in the latter case, very heavy handed intervention by security
                    police to break it up.</p>
                <p>The democrats got the process under control, however, and the police did not
                    intervene, and so the demonstrations remained peaceful until the climax. Towards
                    the end of this period, the protests were spreading throughout the country,
                    including along some of the main highways. Roads were closed sporadically and
                    there were some clashes. Downtown Sofia was almost totally closed down by
                    protesters. It was getting to be a very tense situation because it was obvious
                    that there was a lot of political discontent with the horrible mess the
                    Socialists had gotten the country into, and the democratic forces were able to
                    build up this pressure against them.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>At this time the head of the Socialist Party was Jan Videnov, who was young but
                    of the old school. There were two other major leaderone was the Interior
                    Minister - who were also relatively young but, more importantly, were very
                    pragmatic. The situation got to the point where there had to be a decision
                    within the Socialist Party as to how they would finally respond to this
                    tremendous political pressure and the fact that they were losing their
                    parliamentary control. Some of the Socialists in Parliament were falling away
                    and moving to the Social Democratic Party.So the Socialists ultimately had to
                    decide whether they would try to hang on to power at all costs or whether they
                    would step back and allow new parliamentary elections to be called, as demanded
                    by the protesters. The two more pragmatic leaders carried the day, and the
                    Socialists refrained from bringing the situation to a point of violent conflict
                    by trying to break up the demonstrations. At the last minute they stepped down
                    from government, allowed a caretaker government to come into place, and
                    elections were called shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>Of course the Socialists lost the election and the Union of Democratic Forces and
                    other generally pro-democracy parties came back in. It was a tremendously
                    exciting spring, that last spring of 1997. It was like a second democratic
                    revolution in the country to finish the work left undone back in 1989-1990.</p>
                <p>When the democratic forces came back into office, they did so with a much clearer
                    reform mandate than they had ever had before. The events of the spring had
                    finally forged a political consensus among Bulgarians that they had to take
                    reform seriously and implement it effectively. They finally accepted that they
                    really had to bite the bullet and proceed with democratic and market reform,
                    even though it would be painful, particularly market reform. They finally made a
                    real break with the past and agreed generally on where the country needed to go,
                    including towards NATO and EU membership. It took all those years to get to that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations with Turkey at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: There was a set of issues. The Bulgarians had some serious work to do
                    with the Turks on cooperation in law enforcement, especially on the problem of
                    drug trafficking, and we did see some things accomplished in this area.</p>
                <p>Regionally, with the Yugoslav sanctions in effect, we were concerned about the
                    impact of the sanctions and of the Yugoslav wars on the trade patterns in the
                    area. One of the issues concerned goods that would normally transit from the
                    Balkans to Western Europe through Yugoslavia via the famous “Brotherhood and
                    Unity” highway across Yugoslavia. That had been a pretty efficient route for the
                    heavy truck traffic from Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East. The Balkan
                    conflict cut off that route. So issues arose concerning alternate routes,
                    managing truck traffic at multiple border crossing points, and so forth. There
                    were serious problems with long backups at the border crossing points.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>At this stage, Ambassador Richard Schifter came up with his notion of the
                    Southeast Europe Cooperative Initiative. This is kind of a long story, and I
                    don't really want to dwell on it, but the idea was that there needed to be
                    uniform ways of handling customs matters and transit of trucks and other traffic
                    across the borders throughout Southeast Europe. This was needed in order to let
                    the goods flow smoothly and to diminish the negative economic impact of the
                    Yugoslav sanctions from disruptions of normal trade patterns. It was very hard
                    to get this initiative off the ground, in no small part because the U.S. did not
                    have funds to put behind it, though Ambassador Schifter did eventually attract
                    very modest U.S. and other international funding. There were several attempts to
                    get at these issues. The Southeast Europe Cooperative Initiative was one, and it
                    has endured over time. It has now been merged partially with the Stability Pact
                    for South East Europe.</p>
                <p>The South Balkan Development Initiative was another attempt to encourage
                    cooperation among, specifically, Albania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia on
                    transportation and communication links. Our main involvement there was through
                    the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) and the Commerce Department. Again,
                    we didn't have really have serious resources to put against it, other than
                    through TDA feasibility studies. It was largely a matter of trying to get the
                    countries to cooperate among themselves to let traffic flow and build
                    infrastructure to support new transit patterns. If the individual country didn't
                    see a benefit for itself, especially an immediate or short-term benefit, it
                    wasn't going to put a lot of resources into it. So the cooperation was thin and
                    progress minimal. There were a lot of efforts to try to get at this set of
                    issues. It was very hard to do for lack of resources and lack of political will
                    among the countries to cooperate very effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, I wouldn't think the Russians had much to
                        offer for Bulgaria ?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, they didn't, but they kept their footprint there. Theirs was still
                    one of the largest, if not the largest, embassies in town. They had close
                    relations with the former communists on the Bulgarian political scene. The
                    Russian embassy maintained a large, separate cultural center as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you elaborate a little on the official American
                        presence in Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Let me mention a couple of things about the American presence, just to
                    give a sense of what it was like to work there. It was a really difficult
                    situation in terms of the physical layout. We had this teeny, tiny, ugly embassy
                    building which I'm sure was crowded and cramped and too small even during the
                    communist period when the embassy had a very small staff. By the time we got
                    there the official American presence had blossomed. There were perhaps 100
                    Americans on the embassy staff, so that tiny building in downtown Serbia housed
                    only a small portion of the embassy staff. The Embassy building held the
                    ambassador's front office, the small Political and Economic Section, the Defense
                    Attach�'s office, the Regional Security Officer, and a few others. Everybody
                    else was disbursed in buildings throughout the rest of the city not very close
                    by, not very easy to get to and from. The USIS office was half a dozen blocks
                    away, right in the heart of downtown Sofia. It was a neat location, but hard to
                    get to and vulnerable from a security standpoint. It would take longer to drive
                    there than to get there walking.</p>
                <p>USAID was in a separate building at the opposite end of the downtown area in a
                    medium rise building. The Consular Section and most of the Admin staff were
                    somewhere else in a residential neighborhood.I never did find a good way to get
                    there. There was a separate Peace Corps office. The doctor's office and the CLO
                    were elsewhere. We were just all over the place. It was a sizable presence by
                    then and we were totally spread out. It was very hard to hang on to a sense of
                    an American community. We did have the Marine House, a new house on the
                    outskirts of town, to resort to for TGIFs on Friday evenings and for other
                    events. It became something of a gathering place, as is often the case.
                    Otherwise it was hard to feel a sense of community.</p>
                <p>I credit the two ambassadors we had - both Ambassador Montgomery and Ambassador
                    Bohleplus the DCM for trying really hard and I think with some success to make
                    an American community of all this, but it was difficult.</p>
                <p>The main embassy building, which used to be an apartment building, was absolutely
                    the pits. It was a dump and a fire trap. It was a tall skinny building with an
                    elevator that often didn't work. The facilities were crumbling. State Department
                    visitors told us it was the worst American Embassy they'd ever seen. The only
                    nice thing about my own office was that, having apparently been a separate
                    apartment at one point, had a separate powder room. It was the one and only
                    “executive washroom” I ever had in the Foreign Service. Even the Ambassador's
                    office in Sofia didn't have an executive washroom, so I was lucky on that score.
                    A brand new American Embassy has just been opened in Sofia. I've seen the
                    drawings and pictures, and it looks really lovely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Romania?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>HANSEN: I mentioned earlier that there a sort of running competition between
                    Bulgaria and Romania as to which was doing better on reforms and which had
                    better relations with the United States. During the time that I was in Bulgaria,
                    Romania was definitely ahead of the curve. The Romanians had their reforms
                    better underway, although it was such a long haul in Romania and they had such a
                    long way to go. Their relations with the United States were better at that time.
                    Things were looking pretty good for Romania. The Bulgarians had a hard time
                    understanding why the United States looked favorably on Romania at that stage. I
                    expect it was the other way around whenever Bulgaria happened to be ahead of the
                    curve. Their relationship was not particularly close or warm.</p>
                <p>One of the abiding issues, and it may still be an issue, was the location for a
                    second bridge across the Danube. There is only the one bridge across the Danube
                    River between Bulgaria and Romania, at Ruse on the Bulgarian side. There was a
                    running debate as to whether there was enough truck traffic and economic
                    activity to justify a second bridge and if so, where it should be located and
                    how it could be financed. There were political aspects to this issue on both
                    sides of the border. Romania's then-President Iliescu was thought to favor a
                    location closer to his home territory of Iasi, Romania. Bulgaria wanted the
                    bridge at the other end of the river border in Northwestern Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>Another bilateral issue between them had to do with the Bulgarian nuclear power
                    plant, Kozloduy. The European Union had long since told Bulgaria that it had to
                    close down portions of that plant and upgrade others. If there were a nuclear
                    incident at that plant, the prevailing winds would carry any polluted air into
                    Romanian territory. To counter that issue, the Bulgarians claimed concern about
                    pollution from a Romanian chemical plant. These issues came into play from time
                    to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling among the Foreign Service people,
                        comparing Bulgaria's experience to that of Poland, the Czech Republic, and
                        Hungary, that Bulgaria was at the lower end of the totem pole?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Perhaps somewhat. Certainly we understood fully why Bulgaria suffered by
                    comparison to those other countries in terms of the reform experience and the
                    relationship with the United States. We all knew that Bulgaria faced a much
                    tougher situation, started out from a lower starting point, and did not have the
                    kind of historical relationship with the United States that some of the other
                    countries did. Everyone understood the sort of the special political claim that
                    Poland. for example. had on America's good graces and why Poland received far
                    more U.S. assistance than Bulgaria ever did. I think people sometimes felt that
                    we were laboring in the field and doing our best but finding it a discouraging
                    situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>That's why, towards the end of my tour, it was so exciting in those last six
                    months to see the turnaround that occurred and to see the possibilities that
                    Bulgaria could now take off on a reform trajectory. And they did just that. It's
                    still been a long slow process, but they did take off. They turned that corner
                    and headed in the right direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the universities? Were they a source of
                        intellectual and political ferment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Not ferment, I wouldn't say. Bulgarians are a very highly and well
                    educated people. They are very education-oriented and intelligent, very
                    hardworking academically. Larry will tell you more about this, but, in terms of
                    a place for political dissent and so forth, there were some student groups and
                    there were some students active in the political parties. But I wouldn't
                    describe the universities as a separate nucleus of political activism as such.
                    I'm sure Larry will talk to you about the American University in Bulgaria
                    (AUBG). After 1989, there was an American university set up in the town of
                    Blagoevgrad in Southern Bulgaria, funded primarily by George Soros and the U.S.
                    Government..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this go back to Roberts College? What about the
                        American College of Sofia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Not AUBG; it's a separate, new university.</p>
                <p>The Roberts College organization did have a school in Bulgaria, the American
                    College of Sofia, a high school, and this brings us to a situation involving our
                    family.</p>
                <p>Prior to World War II, there had been in Bulgaria an American high school on the
                    outskirts of Sofia, run by the same foundation that founded Roberts College in
                    Turkey. The school was closed during World War II. The school property was taken
                    over by the communists after the war and used by the Bulgarian Interior
                    Ministry. When the communist system fell, the foundation asked for the return of
                    its property. Under the early UDF government, a portion of the property was
                    returned and the school gradually re-opened. The Interior Ministry still held
                    onto part of the property. Its guards controlled access to the area including
                    the campus, which was often problematic in that visiting parents or embassy
                    staff were denied admittance on a fairly regular basis, especially early on. The
                    ministry also had a firing range on the property.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>In any event, on a competitive basis, the school admitted a first class of
                    Bulgarian students and year by year added classes to establish a full high
                    school. So this was the American College of Sofia. It essentially became part of
                    the long Bulgarian tradition of foreign-language high schools, in which students
                    complete their high school studies in the specified language. It used a
                    Bulgarian curriculum, which is quite different from the typical American high
                    school curriculum. There were other English-language high schools in Bulgaria,
                    plus high schools taught in French, German, Italian, Russian; the ethnic Turks
                    were advocating for re-establishment of a Turkish-language high school, and that
                    may have happened by now. It's an excellent system that produced excellent
                    results, as we could see by the many Bulgarians we met who were so fluent in
                    foreign languages. Under the communist system, I understood, admittance to these
                    elite schools was often reserved for the elites. The American College in Sofia
                    was quite different in that competitive exams were used. This meant that its
                    student body came from among the very best students in the country.</p>
                <p>By the time we got to Sofia, the school had been back in operation for several
                    years, and we anticipated that our kids would attend. Our older daughter, as a
                    sophomore, joined that first class moving through the high school. It turned out
                    to be a poor match, both academically and socially. At that point, the school
                    wasn't really prepared to teach fully in English. The math book was in
                    Bulgarian, for example. There were a few American teachers on the staff, but the
                    Bulgarian teachers often lapsed into Bulgarian. The students were at times quite
                    antagonistic towards the few international students on campus. It was a very
                    uncomfortable environment.</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, our daughter transferred to a boarding school outside
                    London half-way through the sophomore year. That mid-year transfer was a
                    difficult one, and I'm sure her sophomore year was pretty miserable all the way
                    around. But the new school worked out wonderfully for her, so in the longer run,
                    the situation worked out. She got into the drama program from the outset, was
                    active in it all the way through, and went on to Northwestern University and a
                    very successful career in stage management in Chicago. She had opportunities to
                    get into London often and got to know that fantastic city. As they say, sending
                    a child to boarding school is often as hard or harder on the parents than it is
                    on the child, and I think that may have been the case here. It was a very hard
                    decision to make. We were just thrilled, though, to see how she thrived in the
                    new environment, especially in the junior and senior years.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Our younger daughter attended the Anglo-American School for eighth grade. It had
                    a split campus at the time. The upper grades were located in a building on the
                    campus of the American College of Sofia cum Interior Ministry. It was a
                    situation somewhat similar to what our daughter remembered from Belgrade, so she
                    was quite comfortable there. When it came time to move on to the American
                    College, several of her classmates made the move as well, so she had a good
                    group of cohorts to make the transition. By then, the atmosphere at the college
                    was a little better. Given the academic demands of the school, we lined up a
                    tutor for our daughter who helped her cope with the math and science courses.
                    She ended up doing very well, and was very active in the school's
                    extra-curricular drama program. With her group of friends, primarily from among
                    the international community, she became quite comfortable in Sofia. The kids
                    would hang out downtown on the week-ends, she developed some close friends among
                    the American Embassy staff, and she began to take a real interest in her
                    surroundings. It was a good Foreign Service experience.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get any high level visits?</p>
                <p>HANSEN: Only a few, and none from the State Department. This was a reflection of
                    where Bulgaria stood in terms of U.S. interests and how we judged Bulgaria's
                    progress, or lack thereof, on serious reform. The one exception was a 24-hour
                    visit by Richard Holbrooke, then the special envoy for Yugoslavia. Since he was
                    the highest-ranking State Department visitor, he was treated practically as a
                    head of state, including a dinner hosted in his honor by President Zhelev.</p>
                <p>During our last year in Bulgaria, the Defense Department was taking more of an
                    interest in the country. At around the end of 1996 or early 1997, we had an
                    excellent visit by Undersecretary of Defense Walt Slocum. I mentioned earlier a
                    pro-democracy leader by the name of Solomon Passi, who was a strong,
                    enthusiastic, and steady advocate for Bulgarian membership in NATO. He had
                    founded an organization, the Atlantic Club, to build public support for that
                    goal. Undersecretary Slocum came and spoke to a public session of the Atlantic
                    Club, at the Sheraton Hotel. The room was packed, SRO. His reception was very
                    warm. Slocum seemed thrilled by all of this, saying that he'd never had such a
                    reception in all his travels around the region. I think he may have paid a
                    second visit later on. Partly thanks to the success of his visit, or visits,
                    Secretary of Defense Cohen came in July 1997, right at the end of my own
                    tour.</p>
                <p>This was another great success, thank goodness. It was wonderful to participate
                    in it. By this time Bulgaria had gone through that second revolution, if you
                    will. The Socialists had stepped aside and the democrats had come back in with a
                    parliamentary majority and a real mandate to move the country in a pro-reform
                    way, including towards NATO membership.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>As a sidelight in terms of the logistics of the visit, Cohen was traveling in the
                    region and was in Kiev just beforehand. Apparently the program in Kiev had not
                    gone well and he got bored. On a Friday evening, the embassy in Kiev called me
                    uI was the Acting DCM at the timto say that Cohen wanted to come to Sofia a day
                    early, on Saturday evening, actually about 12 hours ahead of schedule. So at the
                    very last second, we had to move up the arrival ceremonies and juggle some of
                    the arrangements for his meetings and events on the Sunday and also on Monday
                    morning. Everyone in the embassy and on the Bulgarian side pulled together
                    beautifully, and it all came off without a hitch. The success of the visit
                    apparently gave the Secretary a very positive picture of Bulgaria, and he
                    promised to return a few months later for a regional defense ministers meeting.
                    I think the Bulgarians were floored that he would be so spontaneously receptive
                    to that second invitation. The visit was a huge success.</p>
                <p>Speaking personally, it was a real treat for me and a perfect way to wind up my
                    tour on that very nice high note.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the summer of 1997, where did you go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Before we move on, I would just like to register my admiration for the
                    two ambassadors we worked for in Sofia, Ambassador Montgomery and Ambassador
                    Bohlen. They both did great things for Bulgaria and for the U.S.-Bulgarian
                    relationship, often under very trying, frustrating circumstances. It was an
                    honor to work with them.</p>
                <p>When we left Bulgaria, I had the very good fortune of being assigned to a year's
                    senior training at the National War College at the National Defense University
                    at Ft. McNair in Washington, DC. That was a very wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this expand your knowledge of the military? You
                        had worked with the military before, hadn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, I had done some work with the military, but it certainly did expand
                    my knowledge and understanding. Overseas, we always had defense attaches or
                    military advisory groups to work with. Those were generally good relationships
                    and good colleagues to work with, but kind of a small snapshot of the military.
                    In Washington assignments I'd had some dealings with Defense Department
                    colleagues. I frankly found them sometimes a little difficult to work with.
                    State and Defense often had slightly different agendas, of course, and it wasn't
                    always very enjoyable trying to work under those circumstances. The Defense
                    Department always had a very strong card to pla“our way is good for the security
                    of the United States of America” - and they used it often.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The year at the National War College was very instructive in terms of an in-depth
                    exposure to all the military services and seeing how they relate to each other,
                    to get into the military culture a little bit. It's quite a different world from
                    the State Department.A major purpose of having State officers at the National
                    War Collegthere were about a dozen of us in that clasis to allow opportunities
                    for the civilians and the military to understand each other's values and

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any particular projects or
                        trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: That was the best part. In the course of the year, students from each of
                    the military services facilitated trips to representative baseNorfolk, Ft. Bragg
                    in North Carolina, an air base outside Las Vegas, another base at El Paso. On
                    the flight out to Las Vegas, we were on a cargo plane that was doing refueling
                    exercises on the way. We had a chance to go to the back of the plane and watch
                    the guy who did the refueling. A little fighter planit looked like an insect
                    from our perspective inside the cargo plane - came up behind this huge cargo
                    plane. A long hose was maneuvered out to the fighter and attached to pump in the
                    fuel. Then the disconnected and the fighter veered off and away. It was a
                    phenomenal thing to see, very impressive, and certainly an experience that I
                    would never have had any other way.</p>
                <p>The State Department contingent took a turn at this kind of thing also. We were
                    asked to schedule a day of meetings/briefings at the State Department. That was
                    not as exciting as the refueling experience, but we did what we could. The funny
                    part was the planning process. One FSO took on the thankless job of organizing
                    the visit. Her first meeting with the other FSOs for planning purposes was a
                    real kick. Everyone had a “vision” of what the visit should be like and spoke
                    about it eloquently, but she had a terrible time getting people to settle down
                    to logistics. That discussion in itself showed up a major difference between
                    State civilians and the military.</p>
                <p>The year at the War College was just a tremendous opportunity to get a sense of
                    what the military is all about and what its capabilities are and what its issues
                    are. At that time, the military was dealing very much with the issue of what the
                    future threat would be: the terrorist threat, “asymmetrical warfare”. There was
                    a lot of discussion and study of this issue, but it seemed the military had been
                    struggling with it for a long time without making a lot of progress. It's been
                    interesting to see that, under Bush II, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld still has had
                    to work this issue.</p>
                <p>We had a set series of lectures and seminars as the basis for the academic
                    program, plus the opportunity to take elective courses. Many of the speakers
                    were outstanding: Supreme Court Justice Scalia; the then-Mayor of Baltimore;
                    Dick Cheney; Newt Gingrich; top military officers; a couple of top Foreign
                    Service Officers. President Clinton made a major speech at the National Defense
                    University which all of the students attended.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Of the elective courses, the most memorable was a course in Civil War history,
                    which I never felt that I had understood very well. There seemed to be all those
                    generals and all those battles that I couldn't keep straight. The course helped
                    me to understand that in fact there were a lot of different generals involved,
                    particularly on the Union side, because so many of them failed and President
                    Lincoln had to replace them. And one reason there seemed to be so many battles
                    was that the North and the South sometimes called the same battles by different
                    names, the North using a geographic feature such as Bull Run and the South using
                    the place name such as Manassas. And in that case, a second battle occurred at
                    the same site. The instructor took us to visit several different battle sites so
                    that we could get a sense of the strategy and how things played out in military
                    terms. I learned a lot from the course and have continued to do quite a bit of
                    reading on the Civil War.</p>
                <p>The instructor was very good, but he made a mistake at one point towards the end
                    of the course. He said something about Sherman's march to the sea across
                    Georgia, to the effect that, notwithstanding conventional wisdom in the South,
                    in fact he had not destroyed civilian property on the massive scale that was
                    attributed to him. Well, there were a lot of Southerners in the class, and when
                    he made that point, the temperature in the classroom plummeted by a good 20
                    degrees. It got downright chilly, though no one said a word. At the next
                    session, he corrected himself to some extent. He explained that it was not
                    Sherman's policy to destroy civilian property, but in fact the troops did so,
                    interpreting very broadly what constituted property that could support the
                    military effort. In fact, destruction of civilian property did take place.
                    Obviously the instructor had been taken to task by some of his students. At the
                    end of the course, the instructor tried to raise the question, “Is the Civil War
                    really over in the United States?” He got zero response. It seemed to me that
                    the military students had by then just disconnected themselves from him and were
                    in no mood to take up that rather sensitive question. Though I don't mean to
                    suggest at all any issues of racisI saw none of that at the War Collegit seemed
                    that the Civil War was still being fought in the minds of some in the
                    classroom.</p>
                <p>The other big event at the National War College was the travel at the end of the
                    year. As you know, each year the National War College sends its students on
                    field trips around the world. At embassies abroad, we're on the receiving end,
                    but this time I got to be one of the travelers. My group went to Vietnam and to
                    Thailand. This was just as the United States and Vietnam were beginning to build
                    on a new relationship, and the National War College trip was actually one of the
                    first official defense exchanges between the militaries of the United States and
                    Vietnam. We were given the red carpet treatment, including meetings with senior
                    military and Defense and Foreign Ministry officials. We visited both Hanoi and
                    Ho Chi Minh City, which many people there still called Saigon. Then we had a
                    couple of days in Bangkok as well. I had never been to that part of the world,
                    and I can't imagine a better way to go than as part of a U.S. military
                    delegation. In Hanoi, we got to see the Hanoi Hilton where American POWs had
                    been held, and a military museum commemorating the war. Seeing these sights with
                    American military colleagues was quite an experience. The Vietnamese hosts were
                    gracious in their victory, I must say.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I stayed on in Washington after that, and I held a series of jobs in the
                    State Department, beginning with a position as Deputy Director in the Office of
                    Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Affairs in the International Organizations Bureau
                    (IO/PHO). I worked for Edmund Hull, who is now our ambassador in Yemen, and then
                    for Gordon Gray, who is now DCM in Cairo. Bill Wood was Acting IO Assistant
                    Secretary for a good part of my time there, then David Welch.</p>
                <p>The office was labeled “Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Operations” because of the
                    way IO was reorganized at one point, but the main responsibilities were actually
                    in UN peacekeeping and in UN sanctions, not in humanitarian operations as such.
                    I was there from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Our office was divided into two sections. As one of two deputy directors,
                    I headed the section handling U.S. involvement with UN peacekeeping operations
                    in the Balkans, the former Soviet Union, and Cyprus, plus UN sanctions. At that
                    time this meant primarily the sanctions on Iraq and the Oil for Food program
                    that subsequently fell into so much disrepute.</p>
                <p>In Balkans peacekeeping, there were several operations still underway, descended
                    from the UNPROFOR mission that functioned, or mis-functioned, during the
                    Yugoslav conflict. A UN police mission in Eastern Slavonia by then was being
                    spun off to the OSCE. A large civilian mission (UNMIBH) continued in Bosnia,
                    primarily a civilian police (CivPol) operation, while there was a separate NATO
                    military mission. A smaller UN observer mission, unarmed, was on hand in
                    Macedonia (UNPREDEP), including with U.S. military troops. There was also a tiny
                    observer mission on the Prevlaka Peninsula between Croatia and Montenegro
                    (UNMOP). After the U.S. air war in Serbia/Kosovo in 1999, the UN civilian
                    administration mission for Kosovo was established (UNMIK), alongside the very
                    large NATO military presence there. The CivPol component was a major element of
                    UNMIK, but beyond that, UNMIK basically constituted the actual government of
                    Kosovo until local institutions could be established. Beyond the Balkans, other
                    than the Cyprus mission, there were UN missions in Tajikistan and Georgia in our
                    area of responsibility.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>For all of these missions, there were shared responsibilities. Within the IO
                    Bureau, the UN Political Affairs office had the lead on Security Council policy
                    on peacekeeping. IO/PHO handled the more concrete issues of how the U.S.
                    interacted with the actual missions, with the UN Department of Peacekeeping, and
                    especially with Congress, which cast a very critical, skeptical eye towards the
                    UN generally and UN peacekeeping in particular. The regional bureaus, especially
                    EUR, were very much in the picture, and we worked very closely with our EUR
                    colleagues. At the time, there was a special office in EUR for Balkans
                    issuereally for implementation of Bosnian and later Kosovo peace planplus the
                    Office for East European Assistance.So there was a lot of coordination to be
                    done. There was a very big picture there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you come to see UN peacekeeping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It's a very complicated and difficult set of issues. The United States
                    certainly has had changing views about UN peacekeeping over the years. In the
                    late 1990s, we were at something of a low water mark, still reeling from the way
                    the Somalia mission unfolded a few years beforehand. More broadly, there was
                    deep dissatisfaction, and for good reason, with the grave shortcomings of
                    UNPROFOR in the Balkans, and there was the dark shadow of the massacres in
                    Rwanda where the UN essentially did not respond. Kofi Annan was the head of the
                    UN peacekeeping at the time of the Rwanda disaster. In Congress, the Jesse Helms
                    view very much held sway, so there was a great deal of skepticism about the UN,
                    as seen in restrictions on U.S. funding of peacekeeping missions, particularly
                    for Africa. We would often find ourselves in a situation where the U.S. voted in
                    the Security Council to establish a peacekeeping mission, yet Congress blocked
                    any funding for the U.S. share of expenses. This tactic didn't inhibit the
                    missions in any concrete way. They still went ahead. But it meant that other
                    countries contributing troops for the missions were not reimbursed as they
                    should have been. Our UN arrears built up substantially. After the U.S.
                    successfully re-negotiated with UN partners the share that the U.S. would
                    contribute to UN peacekeeping, Congress came along and most of these arrears
                    were settled.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>There were good reasons to be dissatisfied with the UN's performance, but some of
                    the problem lay also within the Security Council, in terms of what UNSC members
                    were prepared to dboth in terms of the kinds of peacekeeping operations
                    authorized and how they were staffed and funded. One underlying problem was the
                    fact that the U.S. paid a large share of the costs for UN functions generally
                    and a slightly larger share for UN peacekeeping. Yet, partly because of the UN
                    requirement for sharing out UN jobs among nationals of the member states, the
                    U.S. did not always have the influence it wanted in actual operations. We were
                    laying out the money yet didn't often see the kind of people in charge that we
                    thought would run things efficiently and well. So we didn't want to pour more
                    money into a weak system. While I was in IO/PHO, the Secretary-General had a
                    special report done on UN peacekeeping. The commission preparing the report had
                    some good solid members. It was headed by Ambassador Brahimi, an Algerian
                    diplomat who was pretty well respected in the Department, and an American
                    academic expert led the staff work. It prepared a very thorough report with a
                    strong set of recommendations. The State Department analyzed it thoroughly and
                    favored a lot of the recommendations. I honestly don't know where it all came
                    down, but from what I see currently, the UN is still facing a lot of the same
                    problems in peacekeeping.</p>
                <p>To go back to the Congressional interest, I wanted to mention the great lengths
                    IO/PHO had to go to in reporting to Congress.As a matter of law our office had
                    to go and brief the Hill, committees on both the House and Senate sides, once a
                    month on UN peacekeeping operations around the world. We called it the Round the
                    World briefings. The briefing materials were prepared in great detail, and the
                    office directors had to spend a lot of time preparing for those sessions. At
                    times they could be quite agonizing. Some of the committee staffers were
                    outright hostile. One of them in particular, on Senator Helms staff, was
                    downright rude and very uncivil. In a way the staffers were sometimes simply
                    playing their roles, doing what their bosses expected them to do. It was not
                    necessarily personal animosity, but it certainly was a very uncomfortable
                    situation and not something that anybody enjoyed being involved in. It was not a
                    real good example of the kind of relationship that the legislative and executive
                    branches ought to have.</p>

                        peacekeeping missions, or terminating existing operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: With the fallout from the American experience in Somalia - the “Blackhawk
                    Down” syndromand together with perpetual congressional concerns, the Clinton
                    administration developed a rather complicated set of criteria to help determine
                    U.S. positions at the UN, or for that matter in regard to unilateral action, on
                    future peacekeeping efforts. There was an outline for analyzing the conditions
                    and problems a peacekeeping mission would be intended to address, whether U.S.
                    participation would make a difference, what the exit strategy would be, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>In a couple of cases in the Balkans we actually did close down peacekeeping
                    missions or portions of them. In one case in Eastern Slovenia, we made ensured a
                    handoff from the United Nations to the OSCE to carry on a police training
                    mission. Ultimately the OSCE mission was brought to a conclusion as well. There
                    was a judicial reform element in the UN mission in Bosnia, UNMIBH, and we worked
                    pretty hard to make sure that that element was passed off to the OSCE. There was
                    congressional opposition to the UN being involved in such a long-term
                    undertaking as judicial reform. A few years later, the CivPol mission in Bosnia
                    was taken on by the European Union, and UNMOP was deemed a success and brought
                    to a conclusion. It was only reasonable to insist on these transitions, to work
                    for conditions where the missions could be ended or handed off to other
                    entities, but Congress was perhaps even more interested in seeing missions
                    concluded as a matter of principle, because they were so costly to the U.S. and
                    because of congressional distrust of the UN. In any event, it was important for
                    the Administration to be able to demonstrate to Congress that UN missions were
                    not unending. Some of the Middle East missions and the peacekeeping mission in
                    Kashmir had gone on for decades, but we were able to bring some of the others to
                    an end. A couple of the UN missions were so old that they had actually been
                    established by the General Assembly many years back, rather than by the Security
                    Council as is the case now.</p>
                <p>We saw a rather unusual situation unfold in regard to one of the Balkans
                    missions, the preventive deployment in Macedonia, UNPREDEP, to which the U.S.
                    contributed military troops. It was one of the few if not the only UN preventive
                    deployment, and it was a genuine success in deterring potential conflict in
                    Macedonia as had been seen elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. Macedonia had
                    long been considered a powder keg, so this was a real accomplishment, no doubt
                    about it. UNPREDEP included several hundred American soldiers over a period of
                    several years, which was unusual in itself, and the way UNPREDEP came to an end
                    was really interesting. For the most part UN missions are periodically
                    re-authorized by the UN Security Council (UNSC). Every six months or every year
                    their mandates are reviewed and usually renewed for another six months or other
                    intervals. In about February of 1999, just before the air war in Serbia due to
                    the Kosovo situation, the mandate for the mission in Macedonia came up for
                    renewal. And just at that time, in a move that was not very smart and certainly
                    not timely, Macedonia decided to expand its commercial relationships with
                    Taiwan. This was totally unacceptable to China, a Security Council member.
                    Several years previously, under somewhat comparable circumstances, China had
                    vetoed mandate renewal for a UN mission in Guatemala, and it predictably
                    followed the same practice. It vetoed the UNPREDEP renewal. This was a genuinely
                    dramatic moment that could not have been anticipated before Macedonia made its
                    gestures to Taiwan. Anyway, it was kind of ironic that we in Washington were
                    wringing our hands over whether or not to renew the UNPREDEP mandatI favored
                    renewaand then all of a sudden the issue was decided for us because of China's
                    veto.</p>

                <p>HANSEN: The UN practice is to pack up quickly. Within a month, they were gone.
                    There was a very unfortunate incident shortly after the veto. Several of the
                    American soldiers in UNPREDEP, for some unknown reason, went off along the
                    Macedonia-Serbia border, a border that was poorly demarcated, if it was marked
                    at all, in the dark of night and got picked up by Serbian authorities. Two or
                    three of them were held for several months by the Milosevic regime in Serbia. At
                    that point, they no longer had UN status, so it was a rather delicate issue for
                    the U.S. government to have to deal with just at that crucial time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Kosovo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: The other major event of course was the formation of the Kosovo
                    peacekeeping mission. UNMIK was established by a UNSC resolution as the U.S.
                    conducted the air war. It had not been at all clear that the U.S. would be
                    looking to the UN for a major role in Kosovo, and it was brought into the
                    process pretty much at the last minute.I think the UN was somewhat taken by
                    surprise that they were being asked to do this. As I understand it, the decision
                    was made at a very high level, certainly way above where I was at the time,
                    although we'd suspected that something was coming. What other alternative was
                    there? The OSCE had a major role in Kosovo, but the interim administration and
                    CivPol responsibilities fell to the UN.</p>
                <p>The peacekeeping mission, UNMIK, took shape in the summer of 1999. In IO/PHO, we
                    had to take a number of steps to produce the requisite congressional
                    notification for the U.S. support for the UNSC resolution establishing it. This
                    was done over a week-end, late into the evening. I understood that the National
                    Security Adviser himself, Sandy Berger, reviewed and revised the draft
                    congressional notification, which of course was highly unusual. I think it's
                    safe to say that the elaborate procedures set out by the Clinton Administration
                    for evaluating a potential peacekeeping mission, its exit strategy, etc., were
                    just a matter of going through the motions when it came to Kosovo. The UN faced
                    major challenges in getting such a large, far-reaching mission in place, with
                    such a large CivPol component. The CivPol functions are among the most difficult
                    to carry out. So it was a huge undertaking that took shape more slowly than the
                    U.S. would have wanted. But we should have known it would be difficult and slow.
                    The UN essentially provided an interim government for Kosovo until local
                    institutions could be developed. The UN is still in Kosovo today.</p>

                        troops provided by other countries? Their quality?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, these were among the concerns that the State Department had, as did
                    Congress, concerning how the UN did its peacekeeping business and what kind of
                    troops they had to rely on. The problem is that the countries that have large
                    numbers of troops available are not necessarily countries that are going to have
                    well trained and well equipped troops. They can't even transport the troops they
                    have to where they are needed. U.S. troops are well trained and equipped, but
                    we're certainly not going to send them in, in the thousands, to countries in
                    Africa and elsewhere around the world. It's a real dilemma. The U.S. military
                    has had a training program in place for a number of years to train African
                    peacekeeping troops. That has helped a little bit. The UN has to provide much of
                    their equipment, which is costly. There are similar quality issues in terms of
                    the civilian police that countries provide for the CivPol missions. In the
                    Balkans, two of the major UN missions were largely police missionin Bosnia and
                    in Kosovo.UN member countries provide police officers for these missions. In
                    Kosovo, they conducted actually police operations and later were involved in
                    mentoring newly hired and trained police officers. The OSCE ran the police
                    training school in Kosovo. . In Kosovo the international police mission numbered
                    as many as 4,700 so it was a big deal. The quality of training and the kind of
                    equipment the police were able to bring from some of the donor countries was at
                    times a difficult issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving away from peacekeeping, what UN sanctions issues
                        were you involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It was almost entirely the UN sanctions against Iraq and the Oil for Food
                    program. The Oil for Food program at that point had not been in existence very
                    long, but it was already a very difficult one for the UN to administer and for
                    the United States to be engaged in. We had three very well qualified, very
                    energetic people working on it, but it was a real bear of an issue.</p>
                <p>The program is the target of investigations now, so it will be really interesting
                    to see what turns up. There were some problems even as far back as 1998-2000 but
                    I think of a different magnitude than what we're hearing about now. There will
                    be a lot of criticism of the UN in connection with Oil for Food, but I think
                    it's only fair to remember that the UN was trying to do the tasks that the
                    Security Council set for it. The conduct of nationals of Security Council member
                    states was not the responsibility of the UN directly. If nationals were engaging
                    in nefarious business dealings, that has to be considered in good measure a law
                    enforcement issue for the country involveincluding the United States. But
                    looking at the sanctions overall, I would say that we were looking for trouble.
                    Oil for Food was a huge operation, basically trying to control all imports into
                    Iraq. This is just about an impossible task, rife with opportunities for
                    corruption and mismanagement. Such a far-reaching and long-running sanctions
                    regime was bound to run into trouble. At the UN, a lot of discussion arose,
                    partly because of the Oil for Food situation, of “targeted” or “smart” sanctions
                    that would be far narrower and, presumably, shorter term, in order to avoid some
                    of those problems. Perhaps by now there has been some progress in that
                    direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, the big issue, really, was the impact of the sanctions on Iraq
                    itself and how Saddam Hussein played the sanctions issue to his own benefit.
                    Broad UN sanctions on trade with Iraq had been imposed in the context of the
                    Gulf War. For a long time Saddam Hussein refused a proposed Oil for Food program
                    that would allow Iraq to sell oil and use the proceeds to buy humanitarian goods
                    for the country. He preferred, apparently, to let his people suffer, rather than
                    to cooperate with the international community even to that extent. He preferred
                    to complain and rant and rage against the international community for imposing
                    sanctions at all, rather than cooperate with a system that would alleviate the
                    impact of the sanctions. When he finally agreed to the Oil for Food program in
                    about 1996, the term “humanitarian goods” was applied very broadly. All manner
                    of goods were sold to Iraq under the program, not only foods, medicines, and
                    medical equipment, but heavy equipment of all sorts, luxury cars, equipment to
                    maintain the oil industry. A fundamental feature of the program was a
                    UN-administered food distribution program, in which “food baskets” of basic
                    foodstuffs were distributed throughout the country. That's on the “food” side.
                    On the “oil” side, there was a small international committee, I think it was a
                    three-person committee, that set the sale price for legitimate oil exports from
                    Iraq under the program. That said, Iraq also engaged in significant smuggling
                    and sale of oil outside the Oil for Food program. There was also oil trade
                    between Iraq and Jordan that was permitted, or at least overlooked, separate
                    from the Oil for Food program. That was a concession to Jordan, as far as I
                    understood, to help ensure its cooperation in administering the program.</p>
                <p>The Oil for Food program grew to be a huge undertaking. There were thousands of
                    contracts, each of which had to be approved by the UN Sanctions Committee for
                    the Iraq sanctions. Most committee members did not review the proposed contracts
                    carefully, but of course the United States, and maybe the UK, did. Outright
                    military goods were barred anyway, but we needed to look out for any dual use
                    itemgoods that had a legitimate civilian purpose but could be diverted to a
                    military use, especially nuclear or chemical or biological warfare (CBW). Our
                    staff had to manage the interagency review of the contracts overall and the
                    sensitive contracts in particular. Given the huge number of proposed
                    transactions, this process became incredibly cumbersome. A backlog built up,
                    leaving the U.S. vulnerable to criticism that we were delaying provision of
                    humanitarian goodeven though, strictly speaking, it was seldom humanitarian
                    goods as such that were held up. Countries whose companies wanted to conclude
                    their sales would object to delays. Russia and France, both of which were very
                    large participants in the Oil for Food program, were especially active in
                    pushing for approval of contracts of interest to them.</p>
                <p>We took a number of steps to streamline our internal USG processes, and the
                    situation improved somewhat.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The overall situation reminded me of my previous job in the office of East West
                    trade many years back, where we dealt with the controls on high tech exports to
                    communist countries. We had many agonizing sessions with Defense Department
                    analysts and CIA analysts in trying to figure out what could be approved and
                    what should not be approved. We were looking at things like refrigerated pumps,
                    fertilizer equipment, pumps of various kinds that theoretically could be used in
                    a CBW program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now that the U.S. is involved in rebuilding Iraq, it
                        seems that the sanctions really dug deep into the infrastructure of the
                        country and really harmed it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: It depends on how you look at the situation. Certainly people made the
                    argument that the sanctions did dig deeply and did hurt Iraq and its people. We
                    heard that kind of very sharp criticism. The way we looked at it at the time was
                    that Saddam Hussein had the ability to buy products on the international market
                    to meet the needs of his own country. Very unfortunately, the Iraqi regime chose
                    instead to spend its oil earnings in ways that did not go very far in meeting
                    the nutrition and health needs of the people. That was not the fault of the
                    sanctions; that was Saddam Hussein's doing. In Northern Iraq, where the UN
                    administered the Oil for Food program more directly, people were significantly
                    better off. There was plenty of money flowing in under the Oil for Food program.
                    If Saddam Hussein had decided to invest in the educational sector, he could have
                    spent his money there rather than on his palaces or on fancy cars for his
                    friends and things like that.</p>
                <p>We certainly shouldn't have been surprised that he would manipulate the Oil for
                    Food program as he did, to his own benefit. Our view was that the resources were
                    there to meet people's needs - not fully, but to meet them better than they were
                    being met. The fact that they were not met better was really the responsibility
                    of Saddam Hussein, not the sanctions themselves. The bottom line was that people
                    did suffer. It seemed very easy for some critics to blame the sanctions and not
                    turn a critical eye to Saddam Hussein. As long as critics could point to
                    under-nourished children, crumbling schools, and ill-equipped hospitals, the PR
                    battle was a losing battle, I think.</p>
                <p>Looking at the Iraq sanctions issue overall, I think the system was effective in
                    keeping dual use items out of the hands of Saddam Hussein. In terms of trying to
                    manage a very large process of allowing designated humanitarian goods to come
                    into the country, distributing goods throughout the country, and meeting the
                    humanitarian needs of the people, it was far more problematic. It was a little
                    like trying to run a centralized economy, like trying to run Iraq from the UN in
                    New York. What an impossible task! We always said that a centralized economy
                    such as the Soviet Union could never really work, yet in a sense we were asking
                    the United Nations to run a centralized economy in Iraq.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>As I mentioned, problems of this kind contributed to discussions at the UN about
                    how to craft “smart” sanctions so that they would not cause suffering among the
                    innocent people of a country but instead would directly target the leaders
                    responsible for violating international norms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave the IO Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: I left in the summer of 2000 and moved to the Bureau for International
                    Narcotics and Law Enforcement, INL. This is the so-called “drugs and thugs”
                    bureau.This was probably the only job I ever had in the Foreign Service that my
                    kids and my parents seemed to make sense of. The term “drugs and thugs” meant
                    something, as opposed to all that vague work I'd done previously in political
                    affairs, peacekeeping and so forth. The term rang a bell.</p>
                <p>I worked in INL from the summer of 2000 to the summer of 2002. In the IO bureau I
                    had been a deputy office director. In INL, I was able to get a position as an
                    office director which was nice, not least because office directors got parking
                    passes for a modest fee. I was director of the Policy Planning and Coordination
                    Office (INL/PPC), which actually covered quite grab bag of functions. Our office
                    handled the INL Bureau's public affairs and public diplomacy functions, plus
                    congressional relations and relations with the United Nations in its anti-drug
                    and anti-crime programs through the UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) and a
                    related office on crime. We produced the State Department's major annual report
                    on the drug issue, the international narcotics control strategy report, which
                    was probably about 800 pages long. We had a small staff that came in on a
                    temporary basis and prepared that report every year, pulling together
                    information provided by our embassies overseas and relevant Washington agencies.
                    Most of the work of the office focused on counter-narcotics, particularly in
                    Latin America, since the great bulk of the bureau's funding was dedicated to the
                    Latin American illegal drug problem.</p>
                <p>Another major function of the office was kind of an odd thing to have in that mix
                    but it was a very important job. During my tour in INL, I recommended that this
                    function be separated out and bolstered as a separate office, and I understand
                    that something along those lines was done a couple of years later. In any event,
                    this was the staff of five or six officers who managed U.S. participation in
                    international police missions under the UN or the OSCE. We were contributing
                    some 600 police to the UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo at that time, plus
                    providing the leadership for the OSCE police training school in Kosovo. It was
                    our office that managed the recruitment of those officers through a contractor,
                    DynCorp, and oversaw their functions in place. Other major police missions were
                    still in place in Bosnia and East Timor. When the United States went into
                    Afghanistan, this staff got involved in the planning for police training
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>This CivPol staff was a highly effective staff that I admired very much. The
                    success of their work overall really stood out in Kosovo. They were involved in
                    the early planning for the Kosovo police mission, and it was their strategic
                    thinking that shaped the 4700-strong UN police mission and the OSCE police
                    training school there. These two endeavors have been among the major success
                    stories in Kosovo, where a new police force had to be built from scratch. It was
                    quite a remarkable achievement. The police function for Kosovo represented a
                    huge investment for the United States. For a while there, it was costing roughly
                    a million dollars a week.</p>
                <p>In terms of the UN police missions, these presented the same kinds of challenges
                    as other UN peacekeeping missions. The UN had a hard time getting contributing
                    countries to provide capable and appropriately trained police. The police
                    missions often had to be set up rapidly, which only added to the problem. Even
                    the United States had some difficulty in getting the right kind of officers into
                    the field, though we improved significant after some initial problems in, say,
                    Haiti and Bosnia. This was something that INL worked on continuously all during
                    the period that I was associated with it, whether in IO, in INL itself, or later
                    in the EUR assistance office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the drug business. That was the main
                        issue for INL, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Absolutely. The real issue for the bureau was drugs coming into the
                    United States. That meant that the real issue was Latin America because most of
                    the drugs came from Latin America, from Colombia and other countries. This was
                    the time of the so-called “Plan Colombia” through which we were supporting
                    Columbia's efforts at eradicating the coca crop by aerial spraying of herbicide.
                    Colombia was the third largest recipient of U.S. assistance, after Israel and
                    Egypt, so that reflects how important the effort was to the United States.</p>
                <p>This was also a time when an aircraft interdiction program was in place. It
                    allowed local air forces to intercept airplanes in their airspace that were
                    thought to be involved in drug trafficking, including shooting them down if the
                    pilots did not heed specified warnings. The U.S. provided advisers and other
                    assistance in running this program. I gathered that this had been a very
                    controversial program when it started up several years ago, and that State
                    Department lawyers were very critical of it because of civilian aircraft safety
                    issues. I believe the program nevertheless served quite well for a time.
                    Unfortunately, and disastrously, there was a terrible mistake in the program
                    several years ago in which a missionary airplane was shot down by the Peruvian
                    military. An American missionary and her infant adopted daughter were killed in
                    the incident. Others on the plane were injured. The aircraft interdiction
                    program was then suspended for a time, and its procedures were reviewed and
                    tightened, and it was reinstated later on, as far as I understand.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Well, that was one very sad event. But the counter-narcotics program in Latin
                    America was controversial on a lot of other counts as well. Who knows whether it
                    will ever succeed. Everyone in the bureau certainly understood that demand in
                    the U.S. for illicit drugs was a major part of the problem, but dealing with
                    that aspect was not our mandate. We also understood that alternative development
                    was crucial to the success of the counter-narcotics effort, and no one pretended
                    that we really had enough resources going into those efforts. Mr. Randy Beers
                    headed the bureau most of the time I was there. I recall his telling a
                    journalist at one point, who was challenging him on the record of Plan Colombia,
                    that we simply had to try. We had an opportunity to assist a Colombian
                    government that was trying to get the issue under control, and to reassert
                    control over its own territory, and we at least had to try to do our part to
                    make it work, understanding fully how difficult it was and how elusive success
                    might be. The idea was to cut off the supply as close to the source as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with international crime, was there crossover
                        into counter-terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes. The 9/11 attacks occurred while I was in INL, so we were involved,
                    as was literally everyone else in the State Department, in responding to the
                    terrorism challenge as we came to see it in a new light. Most of INL's work in
                    this area had to do with terrorist financing. Another office in the bureau
                    handled it directly and worked closely with Treasury and Justice on
                    international cooperation to tighten countries' controls on international
                    banking and finance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Congress loomed large in our picture, and INL/PPC had an officer
                    dedicated to the congressional liaison function, supporting the INL front
                    office, which dealt with Congress intensively and at senior levels. The
                    Assistant Secretary seemed to be on the Hill all the time. He worked that angle
                    very assiduously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave INL?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>HANSEN: I finished in the summer of 2002 and went back into the European Bureau,
                    what I considered my home bureau. I took a position in the Office of the
                    Coordinator of U.S. Assistance for Europe and Eurasia. Ambassador William Taylor
                    headed the office at that time, though he left soon to work in Kabul on
                    assistance coordination for Afghanistan. Tom Adams became the Acting Coordinator
                    for almost a year, until Ambassador Carlos Pascual arrived as Coordinator, a
                    DAS-equivalent position. As one of three deputy coordinators, I headed the
                    office overseeing U.S. assistance to Eastern Europe, an annual budget of about
                    $500-600 million, primarily for Southeast Europe and Romania. By 2002, Poland
                    and the other Northern Tier countries, except Romania, had “graduated” from U.S.
                    assistance and were receiving only residual amounts of support. I served in
                    EUR/ACE until I retired in May 2004.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to return to EUR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Well, as I was finishing up in the INL Bureau, I actually had begun to
                    think about retirement. I couldn't quite bring myself to turn in the paper work,
                    however, so I concluded that I wasn't really quite ready and would go for one
                    more assignment in the Department. By then, Larry was already retired, and I
                    didn't really want to think about serving overseas so close to my own likely
                    retirement, given the benefits of locality pay in Washington. As it happened, I
                    didn't get bids in until quite late in the assignment cycle. Coincidentally this
                    position in the European Bureau was still available. I think someone else had
                    been in line for it and then backed out at the last moment for some reason. I
                    went ahead and applied for it and got it. As a Senior Foreign Service position,
                    it was a stretch assignment, which was good.</p>
                <p>EUR/ACE was in a rather strange position within the European Bureau. The
                    assistance functions for both Eastern Europe and for the Soviet Union had each
                    originally been separate from the regional bureau, under the Deputy Secretary
                    and/or under a Special Coordinator. With reorganization within the Department,
                    and with downsizing of the special Bosnia and Kosovo implementation offices in
                    about 2001, these functions were brought directly into the regional bureau but
                    with a special status. The Assistance Coordinator, somewhat like a DAS, reported
                    directly to the EUR Assistant Secretary. Under the Coordinator were the three
                    deputy positions, which were equivalent to office directors. I handled Eastern
                    European assistance; another deputy handled the former Soviet Union, and a third
                    handled law enforcement assistance and cross-cutting budget management. It was
                    all rather clumsy bureaucratically.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>In managing U.S. assistance to Eastern Europe, we coordinated closely with the
                    regional EUR offices for the countries involved, to ensure that the assistance
                    supported policy appropriately, to further democratic and market reform. We
                    managed the allocation of assistance funds to a dozen or so assistance
                    implementers, primarily USAID, which administered about 70% of the funding.
                    Other major implementers were State/INL in support of U.S. participation in
                    international police missions and in police training functions, Commerce, TDA,
                    and Justice. The major recipients were Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia, and Macedonia,
                    and then smaller programs for Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia.
                    Montenegro benefitted from a generous congressional earmark and so also had a
                    sizeable program, despite its very small size. With a population of only about
                    650,000, Montenegro was no doubt the largest per capita recipient of assistance
                    in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Baltics, Poland, and others had matured enough so that
                        they were out of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes. They had essentially, as we put it, “graduated” from bilateral U.S.
                    assistance several years earlier at different points in time. Over the years,
                    Poland had been far and away the largest recipient of U.S. assistance, yet even
                    its “graduation” took place later than originally anticipated. In all cases, the
                    transition away from communist systems to democracy and market economics took
                    longer than we had thought. By the time 2002 rolled around, however, pressure
                    was building within the Administration to bring assistance to a close even in
                    the countries for which the transition had been far more difficult, such as
                    Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
                <p>On my first day back in EUR, I sat in on the Deputy Secretary's session with the
                    EUR Bureau to hear its budget proposal for the ensuing fiscal year. Just about
                    the first thing the Deputy Secretary asked about was when we would see more
                    graduations from U.S. assistance. In my area, he cited specifically Bulgaria,
                    Croatia and Romania. OMB was also very anxious to see graduations in these
                    countries and maybe in Russia as well.</p>
                <p>As a result, much of my work in EUR/ACE involved review processes for the future
                    of our assistance to those countries. Though these were hard decisions to reach,
                    we ultimately set schedules for graduations by Bulgaria and Croatia, and Romania
                    was pretty clearly going to be next in line. One issue that figured prominently
                    in our deliberations was these countries' progress towards EU membership. They
                    were in fact progressing and, obviously, the closer they got the harder it was
                    to justify sizeable U.S. assistance. We had excellent congressional support for
                    East European assistance. During the time that I worked on these programs,
                    Congress always appropriate more funding than the Administration requested. Our
                    main struggle for funding was within the State Department itself and with
                    OMB.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Another substantive concern for us was assistance coordination with the European
                    Union. As part of our approach to “graduation”, we were very much thinking that
                    these countries should be aided by the European Union more so than by the U.S.
                    With our diminishing resources, we needed to make sure that we avoided
                    duplication and that U.S. and EU efforts were complementary. A special situation
                    prevailed relative to Serbia, where the bulk of our assistance was contingent on
                    Serbia's cooperation, or lack thereof, in rendering indictees to the
                    International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in The Hague.
                    Particularly close coordination with the European Union was needed in order to
                    bring focused pressure to bear on Serbia to improve its record of cooperation.
                    This approach succeeded over time, though as of this writing in the summer of
                    2005, the two major Serbian indictees, Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko
                    Mladic, are still at large.</p>
                <p>We've seen good progress in the region and it was an honor to play a role in it.
                    The fate of the former Yugoslavinotably Serbia, Bosnia, and especially Kosovof
                    course remains a very incomplete story. There is still important work to be
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you finished up in 2004.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HANSEN: Yes, I went ahead and retired in May of 2004, having left EUR/ACE at the
                    end of February.</p>
                <p>Looking back on Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall, particularly
                    the Balkans where so much terrible violence occurred, I think it's just
                    phenomenal what was accomplished. Though their transformations were more
                    difficult and took longer than originally anticipated, it's still tremendously
                    impressive to see how far the countries of the region have come. Most have
                    already joined or on track to join soon both NATO and the European Union. These
                    are truly major accomplishments. The people of the region deserve all the credit
                    they can get for making this happen, but much credit also goes to the United
                    States and to the U.S. taxpayers who made such generous investments in the
                    transformation of the region. It has been extremely worthwhile and a real
                    success story. We can all be very proud of what has been accomplished. Though
                    the job is certainly not yet done, it was a great experience for me to be
                    involved in it and to be able to conclude my Foreign Service career on such a
                    high note.</p>
