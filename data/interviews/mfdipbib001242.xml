                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 29, 1999</p>

                <p>Q: Today is the 29th of July, 1999. This is an interview with William A.
                    Weingarten, and this is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                    Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Well, why don't we sort of
                    begin at the beginning. Would you tell me when and where you were born and
                    something about your family?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Okay, I was born in New York City in 1936 and was raised on the South
                    Shore of Long Island and left there in 1954 for university. I went to
                    Colgate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back. What did your father and mother do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: My mother was a housekeeper. My father was the associate comptroller
                    of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. He worked in New York; we lived on Long
                    Island, in a small town called Baldwin. It's about 20 miles outside the
                    city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brothers, sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I have one brother, two years younger, and he's now in Evansville,
                    Indiana, and he works for American Standard. He's thinking of retiring, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, let me see. I have to cast back for that. I went to two
                    elementary schools in Baldwin. One was - I can't think of the names.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't have to know the names.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Then I went to high school in Baldwin.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What interested you during your grammar school and high
                        schooyears?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Grammar and high school years? Probably sports, reading - history in
                    particular. I used to cause my parents some concern sometimes when they'd ask me
                    what I wanted for Christmas and I'd say I want a copy of Panzer Battles, by F.S.
                    von Mellenthin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guderian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: That's Lost Victories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Lost Victories. Guderian was -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, Guderian wrote another one. And I'm not sure what they thought I
                    was doing, whether I was going to grow up to be a Nazi or what. But I always had
                    a deep interest in history. I wanted to go to West Point after high school and
                    applied for it but could not get in because of my eyesight, and I didn't know
                    enough at the time to seek a waiver. So I didn't go to West Point. And finally I
                    didn't even get the application in. I went to Colgate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into this? Was it military history you
                        werinterested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, pretty much so. And then I got into the other branches of
                    history at Colgate. I had a terrific professor there by the name of Douglas
                    Reading, and he was my mentor, I suppose, and I took a lot of history courses,
                    took just about every history course they offered there, and graduated with
                    honors in history. But I still wasn't quite sure what I was going to do with it
                    after I finished the course of study at Colgate, and Reading said, “Why don't
                    you look into the Foreign Service?” And so I did. And was supposed to take the
                    test in 1957, I think it was, and the test was offered in Syracuse. And it was
                    December.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the written test.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, the written test. And I had an old car at the time. I had a 1949
                    Ford, and there are a lot of hills between Colgate - Hamilton, New York - and
                    Syracuse in a snowfall. Big snowfall the night before. I couldn't get my car up
                    the hill, so I did not get to take the exam. Then I graduated in 1958, and at
                    that time there was a problem. The economy was not doing very well, and a lot of
                    guys would graduate from college without a job, and that was my situation. I
                    went back to Baldwin, worked as a garbage man for another three months, and then
                    joined the Army.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Army from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: 1958 to '61. September '58 to I think about July o'61.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was in intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Initially in Fort Holabird, Maryland, which is the intelligence
                    school, and then to Korea. I spent 13 months there and came back to a unit in
                    Washington, in the old temporary buildings down near Fort McNair and served
                    there another year and a half. I got my commission in the Army about a year
                    before leaving, and they said, “Well, if you want to take up your commission,
                    we'll have to add another year.” By that time I had had first-hand experience of
                    the Army and I wanted no more of it. I just wanted to get out. So I got out as a
                    sergeant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I served in Inchon. Do you know it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know Inchon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: You do? Okay.</p>
                <p>Q: A little. During the war I was outside of Seoul, actually at Yangtze
                    University, and then some 25 years later I was consul general in Saigon.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, okay. So you know it. I was in Inchon. We had a little offshoot
                    of an intelligence unit, the 308th CIC group, and we had our little squad, about
                    eight people, and we lived in a nice old house. Looking back I guess it dated
                    from the early 1900s. It might have been a rich merchant's house at one time. We
                    were stationed next to the Korean Central Intelligence Agency office there. And
                    we advised them on some things, and other things they didn't need advice on and
                    didn't ask us - mainly beating confessions out of people. They were a very, very
                    tough brand of folks. I was there '59 to '60, and most of what we did was
                    security work. There was a unit also in town that infiltrated people into North
                    Korea from Inchon. We had nothing to do with them. They all served under assumed
                    names. The outfit I was in was much less clandestine than these guys. And we
                    would go out and do security inspections on Army units. Remember ASCOM City?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was a big supply area, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, a big sort of main base behind the lines. And then the only
                    exciting thing that happened to me in Korea was the revolution that overthrew
                    Syngman Rhee in 1960. My unit was among the few permitted to go out into the
                    streets. And we were sort of the eyes and ears for Inchon, or the eyes anyway,
                    for the embassy in Seoul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in Inchon during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: They had, I guess, what has happened in the rest of Korea as well.
                    There was a student uprising, and the students took to the streets from the high
                    schools and middle schools and the university, and they rioted. They attacked
                    police stations, fire stations, government offices. I still remember being in my
                    jeep on a road watching up a hillside and seeing a whole crowd of kids all
                    dressed in black - they all dressed in black at the time - pouring out of the
                    school, down the road, and there were three policemen on the road. And this
                    horde of kids passed over them, down into the town, and when they had passed,
                    you looked up and saw the three cops lying on the ground, dead I think. So that
                    was my excitement. I did manage to make that event. On the way back to the
                    States, I was on a troop ship back to San Francisco, Oakland, at the time that
                    the U-2 crisis broke and the Paris Conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in June of '60.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: June of '60, yes. And the conference that Eisenhowewas to have with
                    Khrushchev was canceled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Paris, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: In Paris. And we were just sort of stuck out on a boat in the middle
                    of the Pacific and thought, Well, you know, this could be when the world goes
                    up, we'll be the last people here probably.</p>
                <p>So we got back to the States, went back to New York, spent somleave, painted my
                    parents' house, and then went to Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, while you were in Korea or in Washington, you had this abortive attempt
                    at the Foreign Service Exam wiped out by snow. Had you been able to talk to
                    anybody about the Foreign Service or get any feel for it?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I hadn't. The only person I had ever known who had any
                    acquaintance with it was this professor at Colgate, Douglas Reading, and he'd
                    never served in the Foreign Service but he knew of it and it was something he
                    pushed his better students in. So no, I never really met anybody from the State
                    Department or the Foreign Service until after I was in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you take the Foreign Service Exam the next
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I finally took it in 1961. When I left the Army in '61 I worked for a
                    year - actually it turned out to be about nine months - for the Equitable Life
                    Assurance Society, my father's firm. They were hiring a corps of management
                    trainees, so I was one of their first management trainees. I really didn't like
                    it, so I decided to cast around for things to do. So I took the law boards first
                    and did very well on those, and then I took the Foreign Service Exam, the
                    written exam, down in Washington, and I passed that. So I then had a choice of
                    whether to go to law school - I got accepted at Harvard - or go in the Foreign
                    Service. And I decided I'd prefer the Foreign Service because it would at least
                    pay me a semi-living wage, whereas three years at law school on beans and soda
                    didn't seem all that appealing. That was, I suppose, one of the major turning
                    points in life. I guess I realized it at the time. One of the amusing things
                    about it is for two or three years afterwards each year I'd receive a card from
                    some guy doing a graduate degree at Harvard wondering what people who had turned
                    down an opportunity to go to the Law School were doing with their lives - which
                    I thought was kind of amusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you take the oral exam? I mean, you had to take
                        thoral exam. When did you take that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I took the written test in late '61, I think, passed that, and took
                    the oral exam, I guess, some time about March or April in '62 and passed that.
                    They took a long time from passing the oral exam to getting on the register. I
                    had all the security clearances that I needed from the Army, so I couldn't
                    understand why I wasn't getting any appointment. I had already told the people I
                    was working for I was going to leave, and finally I called down here, and I got
                    someone named Brown in Personnel. I'm not sure which one it was - Dave Brown -
                    somebody. I said, “Listen, I've got to make a choice. Have I got a job or not?”
                    And so he said, “Well, yes, you've got a job. Why don't you come down.” That's
                    how... I think I got a letter later, but he said, why don't you come down and
                    we'll enter you into the September, 1962, A-100 course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall anything about the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Only that I did very badly on it on artistic things. They asked me,
                    for example, if I could name any painter from the Hudson Valley School. I
                    couldn't do that, and so they... I figured that was it. I didn't know anybody
                    from the Hudson Valley School, so that was the end of me. But it didn't turn out
                    that way. But no, I don't remember very much of it other than I remember - it's
                    kind of funny, looking back at it - going to... I got my hair cut the day
                    before. I wore a very short crew cut at the time. And then that morning I went
                    into New York and had a shave from a barber - It was the first time I've ever
                    done that, first and last time, too - so I'd look sharp. And then on the way to
                    the exam, I was walking with this girlfriend at the time, and some guy knocked
                    into her on the street in New York and knocked her down and just kept on
                    walking. So I went and grabbed him, and I almost had a fight. And I thought, um,
                    I can't go to my... I was on the way to the Foreign Service Exam, and I was
                    really going to belt this guy, and I thought, Well, if I do that, he belts me,
                    I've got blood all over my shirt, how do I explain that? So I didn't. One of
                    those... You always regret more the things you don't do than the things you
                    do.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you came in in 1962, in September? Can you describe your impression of
                    your class of junior officers who came in with you at that time?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It was a big class. I think even then it was one of the bigger
                    classes that had come into the Foreign Service up to that time, I think. And
                    most of the people in it were in their late 20s. There were some in their early
                    30s, I think. For the most part, every one in that entering class had an
                    advanced degree, which made me feel I ought to have one, too, if I was going to
                    compete with these people, and so I kept up for a long time with the people I
                    came in the service with. We didn't actually have class reunions, but we'd see
                    each other when you return to Washington, but that sort of dropped off. I think
                    everybody in that class, nearly everyone in that class, has now left the
                    Service, and I think I'm the last one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about women, minorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: There were two or three women, I think, and I think there was a
                    single African American, but that's all I can remember, and I'm not even sure
                    about that. It was pretty much a white bread class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, did you have any particular area you
                        wanted tspecialize in of any kind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I didn't. I thought I'd like to do intelligence and research, and
                    I thought I might have some kind of a background for that, having been in
                    intelligence and enjoying research. But no, I was told that's not the place to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there really isn't any career in that. I mean, you
                        servyour time in there, but it's not a career option.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: But you know, that's another one of those places where either you
                    make or decisions are made for you that change your life. Anyway, I wanted a
                    master's degree, so I asked for an assignment in Washington, and they gave that
                    to me, and I worked in the Bureau of Economic Affairs, and I went to Georgetown
                    at night. I got into Georgetown, had an interview with the dean, and he took a
                    phone call at that moment from a former student who was going to take the
                    Foreign Service Exam and was sort of panicked about it, and so he asked me to
                    talk to this guy, and so I talked to him for about ten minutes and told him what
                    kind of exam it was, what to expect, just plow on ahead, don't hesitate or spend
                    too much time on the questions. And the dean said, “Well, I wasn't planning to
                    admit you,” until I'd done that. I don't know. It might have been some sort of
                    trick interview thing. So I went to Georgetown at night and got my degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: MS in Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular concentration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Actually, the think it turned out I liked waphilosophy. They had a
                    strong element of philosophy in that course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Jesuit school, and it was run by Father Healy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, Father Healy, and then they'd import Jesuits from France and so
                    on. They had some interesting people there. But as a night school it was just
                    sort of... when you go to school at night you don't make very many relationships
                    with your other students. It's like going to a trade school, in a way, and I
                    don't recall having made any friends in that two years that I was going at
                    night. And that's an interesting time. I spent my vacations over in the State
                    Department's library - it's a pretty good library for these purposes - and wrote
                    my term papers down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were two years with the Economic Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It turned out to be more like two and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be like from '60 -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: '62 to early '65, about two years. And I would have left earlier but
                    I was offered a job in Vietnam in late '64, and I said sure, that sounds great,
                    and I went and talked to my wife at the time, and she said, “Aw, I don't want to
                    go.” She had worked for Newsweek in New York and was trying to get established
                    as a journalist here. So I said okay, and I went back and I said, “Well, you
                    know, I can't go.” And they were really unhappy about that and as much as
                    accused me of chickening out. So then several months later I was offered... they
                    said, “Would you like to go to Beirut?” And I said, “Sure.” And then about two
                    hour later Personnel called back and said, “Well, we're not going to send you to
                    Beirut. We're going to send you to Paris. Would you like that?” I said, “Yes.”
                    I'd never been to Europe before. And so I went and told my wife, “We've got an
                    assignment in Paris.” She said, “Well, I'm not interested in going overseas.” At
                    that point, we split.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long had you been married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Three years, married in '62. That was good to find ouearly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Before we had any children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the economic bureau time, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was a rotational officer, one of a number of rotational officers.
                    Then I was lent to the predecessor of USTR (United States Trade Representative).
                    At that time it was just known as the Special Trade Representative. Christian
                    Herter was in charge of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Christian Herter, Jr.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, the one who had been Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, and governor of Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes. He headed up USTR. This was under the KennedAdministration. So I
                    worked over there about six or eight months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: They were holding hearings for the Kennedy Round, and they had
                    industries that were either for or against tariff cuts would come in and try to
                    make a case. And so you got people like the last handful of people in the
                    country who made lace handkerchiefs by hand. They came in and pleaded for a
                    higher tariff. They didn't get it, and so now you can no longer buy a handmade
                    lace handkerchief. The steel industry came in. The steel industry in particular
                    tried to make a national security case out of it, but it didn't work, so they
                    were confronted with lower tariffs on steel imports. So it was very interesting.
                    It was fun to work on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the government responded
                        to thesindustrial pleas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, we tried to write it up in an evenhanded way, but the arguments
                    against tariff cuts were pretty self-serving or had a national security element.
                    They kind of wrapped themselves in the flag. At the level I was, I never felt
                    any pressure personally. All we were doing was writing up the testimony,
                    condensing it, passing it on. I don't know what sort of lobbying activities
                    might have taken place. I'm sure there were a host of them. Steel was a very
                    important tariff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that what else were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I worked in the Office of Food Policy. I worked in thOffice of Trade.
                    And that was about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about getting your feet wet in the
                        economiside? Was this of interest to you at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I thought at the time it was simply a way station, as I was a
                    political officer. They didn't have cones in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think they had cones then. Where did you get the
                        feeling you wanted to be a political officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I don't know. I think I just came in the Foreign Service with that in
                    mind. I can't recall if we had to make a choice or if we were recruited for
                    specialties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, and pretty much I guess your first assignment would determine to
                    a large degree what sort of career you would pursue, what specialty you would
                    pursue. Anyway, I thought of myself as political officer and got assigned to
                    Paris in '65, went to Paris, and as I say, I'd never been to Paris or France
                    before, and I got there. I took the boat, then, the United States. I took the
                    boat, and that was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. It was the United States or the America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, it was the SS United States. I think the America was the one that
                    went down the Mediterranean. This was the one that went straight across. So I
                    had a grand time, got to Paris exhausted, checked in the embassy, shown my
                    hotel, went to sleep and then woke up at about eight o'clock that night and
                    said, “Bill Weingarten, you're in Paris. You're not going to sleep this night.”
                    And so I got up and did the whole circuit of the Boulevard Saint Germain, up and
                    back, came back about one a.m., and just fell in love. I think now I was
                    probably looking back and think this sort of thing but I really fell in love
                    with the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in Paris from '65 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was initially in the Economic Section with the financial part of
                    it, and then after about a year or so (my boss and I didn't get along very
                    well), I wound up switching to the Political Section, where I did internal
                    French politics with Charlie Tanguy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a little about the economic side. What
                        were yodoing on the economic side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Basically the balance of payments, France's balance of payments and
                    its gold reserves and so on, all that stuff. It was really very interesting
                    stuff, but it's very secretive, and it was very hard to get into the French
                    Finance Ministry for example and find out what they were actually thinking
                    about, although they did have liaison people who would have lunch. I remember a
                    fellow I'd had lunch with who would explain to me what was going on in French
                    and then explained to me again the same thing in English. So it was one of the
                    things that made me want to get my French to a better level, which I did.</p>
                <p>Q: We've always had a Treasury representative over there. Did you find that there
                    was a built-in tension between the Economic Bureau and what you were doing and
                    the Treasury office?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, I was in the Treasury office actually. They had two Treasury
                    guys there and two State Department guys, and I was the junior State Department
                    guy. And as I say, I didn't get along with the Treasury representative, and so
                    away I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, was it personal or just -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: He was a very difficult guy to get along with and had very little
                    patience. His name was Don McGrew. He was in Paris for 35 or 40 years as
                    Treasury attach�. He started there in '45 and lasted, I think, until maybe '80,
                    about 35 years. Very difficult, very irascible, and as I said, had very little
                    patience with rookies, learners, and so I went on to the Political Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Political Section from when?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very interesting time in France.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the French political scene as you saw
                        it, anthen we'll talk about what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Okay. Well, the political scene was dominated by General De Gaulle,
                    who had a moral authority over everyone else in France by virtue of his wartime
                    experience. It seemed to us that he was getting more anti-American as time wore
                    on. And we interpreted such things as his visit to Quebec as a kind of effort to
                    set backfires, if you will, that the United States would have to deal with. But
                    General De Gaulle always kept that on a fairly high intellectual-moral basis.
                    People who worked for him, especially people in the political side of his
                    administration were more fundamentally, it seemed, anti-American and really
                    happy to see the United States take a reverse, take a setback. Students, of
                    course, were very much anti-war. I think it's really about '67 that that started
                    to pick up. The embassy had very close relations with the Socialists, including
                    Fran�ois Mitterrand and his people. And there was also at the time a centrist
                    movement in France, the Centre D�mocrate, led by a man named Jean Lecanuet, who
                    was the head of that, and he was much more open to the United States. We also
                    pushed very hard for European unity, which again was something that the French
                    were holding back on. So the embassy tried to cultivate all three of those
                    groups - the Centre D�mocrate, the Socialists, and the Gaullists - and then try
                    to fend off all the crank groups, people who would come and say, “We'll give you
                    a safe house in Brittany if you give us some money.” And I wound up being the
                    CIA's front man... the person they would shunt people to. People would come into
                    the embassy and say, “I must talk to someone very secretly.” And they'd say,
                    “Well, we'll send you to see Mr. Weingarten.” And so I'd have to listen to all
                    these crank stories. Some of them were pretty funny. I'm not joking. Someone did
                    offer us a safe house in Brittany for blown agents. We got people who published
                    newsletters that didn't go anywhere, just rants against General De Gaulle. So
                    that was kind of funny. You never knew in the Political Section what you would
                    encounter when you went to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember, by this time had the Algerian business
                        beepretty well settled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, the Algerian business? Algeria, the French moved out of there in
                    '62, and after terrible bloodshed and slaughter, the pieds-noirs came back to
                    France, and then there was a lot of turmoil from, say, '62 to '65, when a lot of
                    people in France had a tremendous resentment vis-�-vis General De Gaulle, who
                    they thought betrayed them. And so there were assassination attempts. I think
                    the last one was in '65, when they tried to ambush him outside Paris. They blew
                    his car to pieces, but missed him. But there were a lot of diehard
                    Alg�rie-fran�aise people around at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Q: Sometimes as a new Foreign Service officer, new to France and all, in a way,
                    you're more sensitive to some of the currents that are going through an embassy,
                    and I was wondering, particularly in the Political Section, did you see an
                    embassy where there were those almost for De Gaulle and those against De Gaulle?
                    Were these two sort of currents going on, or were we pretty much of one
                    mind?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I think we were pretty much of one mind, as I recall it. Remember hat
                    this is a big embassy in a big city, and it was not an embassy that tended to
                    coalesce after work or on weekends, and I think that's pretty much the case for
                    most big embassies today. No, actually, I think the one thing, the one glue that
                    marked the Political Section and the Economic Section, and the entire embassy as
                    a matter of fact, was the resentment that we felt much of the time against the
                    French for the snide remarks and efforts to screw us up in North Africa or to
                    play games with us elsewhere. And so there was... when we could get back at them
                    in some way... I'll give you an example. At the time the embassy was completely
                    open, no barricades. The fence was simply ornamental. And the political
                    counselor was assured by the Quai d'Orsay, by the Americas director there, that
                    nothing would happen. He'd gone to complain about the rise in anti-American
                    activity, and about our Marines at a ceremony who were attacked by a crowd of
                    French. So the Americas director said, oh, no problem, and the day after that, a
                    lyc�e professor came in with about two dozen kids to protest the war in Vietnam,
                    and walked into the courtyard of the embassy, and they all threw inkwells up
                    against the side of the embassy, through the windows, and one of the targets
                    they got was the political counselor's carpet. He had this nice office on the
                    courtyard. A couple of ink bottles went through there and got the carpet. And he
                    was just beside himself with joy. He went over to the Quai d'Orsay, told them
                    about this. They said, “Well, of course, we'll pay for the repairs.” So he went
                    out - I don't think he had an Aubusson carpet or anything like that, but he went
                    out for the repairs and did not bother to get the low bid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador during this time, '66 to '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Charles E. Bohlen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Really, the epitome of an ambassador. Q: As a large embassy and as
                    junior officer did you have any contact with him?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes. We would go over to the National Assembly, and he'd want to
                    see somebody, one of the deputies, and I would be sent to fetch the deputy, in
                    effect, as the junior officer in the Political Section. We had 12 people in the
                    Political Section. It was a big outfit. But no, I had contact with him, not
                    daily. But to see him in action was really something.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, he had a tremendous presence. He was a man who had served in
                    Russia He'd also served in Paris in the late '20s, I think, early '30s, learned
                    Russian at the Institute for Oriental Languages, knew Paris, spoke perfect
                    French, was a real presence. That's the only word I can think of. He exuded
                    authority. He knew that any Frenchman who would talk to him would know that
                    whatever message he had to convey would be conveyed to Washington at a very high
                    level. He was a very, very impressive man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the Political Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Richard Funkhouser, Dick Funkhouser. He was the onlpolitical
                    counselor when I was there. And he knew Paris, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during those times, I think we probably had as
                        professionaa group as we've ever had in Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes. I don't know. I served again in Paris in the '90s. Yes, you
                    might be right on that. I think before then they always did. They always had a
                    core of people with real qualifications, who knew France and who knew the
                    language. Afterwards, I think they still kept... it's still such a sought-after
                    post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there speculation among the junior officers about
                        whither De Gaulle and after De Gaulle, thinking about the situation
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, but you could not see any real challenge to De Gaulle except if
                    he happened to be assassinated or fell sick and died. He was so far above the
                    rest of the political world in France that he had no real competitor for
                    president. So I think we did... We tried to look for young Gaullists or people
                    we though would play a role, or were young French political leaders. And we
                    managed to pick people who have played a major role since then - not always to
                    our advantage. One was Jean-Pierre Chev�nement, who's now the minister of
                    interior. We sent him to the States, and he was my project. And he's turned out
                    to be one of the most fundamentally anti-American French politicians you could
                    have. He was minister of defense during the Kuwait-Iraqi business, and had to
                    resign his post as head of the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Society under real
                    pressure, and finally resigned as Minister.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So we would look for people on the International Visitors Program who we thought
                    might play a role in French society, usually in about 15 or 20 years down the
                    road. And so who would replace General de Gaulle if he happened to pass away
                    right then and there? We didn't do very much speculation on that.</p>
                <p>Q: This was still the era, a carryover from the Kennedy time, when we had youth
                    officers and there was a great deal of emphasis on youth. And of course, it
                    turned out in, what was it, May or June of '68, youth was important. Were you
                    still young enough to be kind of a youth officer in those days?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: A bit long in the tooth, but yes, we used to have a pretty active
                    youth program run by a fellow who was a friend of the DCM, as I recall. I may be
                    getting into personality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, personalities are all right. The time has gone
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, anyway, we had a couple of receptions, I recall, at the
                    residence - well, not the residence, the building that eventually became the
                    residence - but these weren't the kind oFrench people... these were kids who
                    were the sons and daughters of the haute bourgeoisie and that sort of thing. I
                    remember one time, it still amuses me, two or three of the other junior officers
                    and myself were recruited by a Frenchman who would throw cotillions - he'd have
                    parties, dances, once a month or so. As it turned out he was an insurance
                    salesman, and what he was doing was starting to introduce people with titles and
                    so on to people who had money, and what he wanted was some kind of spear
                    carriers to just stand around on the walls - and participate, or course - but
                    didn't expect any of them would have the knowledge of French or the family
                    connections to make any kind of impression on any of these girls. So we'd go to
                    these things, and sometimes they were kind of funny. You'd go out to a chateau
                    on the Loire and have a big party - all of us in tuxedo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were observing the mating and breeding ground, in a
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, I really was. It was a kind of meat market, and it was a place
                    where the girls with titles would meet guys who were from the haute bourgeoisie
                    or vice versa - you know, had money but not a title. And so they were very
                    involved, and very sort of snobbish kids and that sort of thing. You know the
                    rest of it was just... I lived in the Latin Quarter, used to meet people, go to
                    cocktail parties and so on. So you got to know a fairly good cross-section of
                    folks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with the Communist Party at that time, and
                        hodid we view the Communist Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: The Communist Party was sort of in a ghetto of its own making. It
                    only cooperated on a arm's-length basis with the Socialist Party, and then only
                    in major elections. As far as seeing us, they had I think one or two people
                    designated as liaison, and they would liaise with the embassy. And we had an
                    officer, Jack Berry, who was our designee, basically, to see these liaisons. And
                    then Jack Berry and I used to go to press conferences that Communist leaders
                    would give. We used to follow what they said fairly closely, but we had very
                    little contact - no unofficial contact with them at all, and very little
                    official.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the feeling that they were a tool of the Soviet
                        Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes, very much so, and the French Communist Party particularly.
                    It was really just an extension of Moscow. As it turned out, it was the one...
                    all the other European parties in the '70s began to mark a degree of
                    independence from Moscow, but the French Communist Party never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave? You left Paris before the invasion
                        oCzechoslovakia, didn't you? That was in August of '68, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: August of '68. I was in Vietnam by then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't feel that repercussion on the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I left Paris, I guess, in April, just before the “Events of May,”
                    as we call them. And I was almost a part of that. I was driving my little German
                    Volkswagen down the Rue Danton, and a huge mob of students came up the Rue
                    Danton, and at the time, everyone in the American embassy had 6CD plates: 6CD
                    and then a number. And everyone in town knew that was an American embassy car.
                    They came up and they started to rock the car - with me in it - and started
                    shouting “Johnson assassin!” and “A bas les am�ricains” and that sort of thing,
                    and so I had to sit there through that. And then they went on about 200 yards
                    further and saw the Radio-Television Luxembourg car up there, a station wagon.
                    They overturned that and burned it. So that was one of the first events, and I'm
                    very happy I didn't wind up with my car burned.</p>
                <p>So I left, and my fianc�e was still there, so I was really... As I recall, we
                    were cut off here in the States from France for about a month. The telephones
                    didn't work; the mail didn't work; everybody was on strike, and so I finally
                    went back to France in July, and I asked my fianc�e to marry me, and she said,
                    yes, okay. So then we spent three weeks in France, on the C�te d'Azur, and then
                    I went back to Paris and flew from Paris to Saigon.</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, not really. The student groups that we knew in the embassy were
                    sort of the Young Socialists, the Young Christian Democrats, the Young
                    Gaullists. But these were all people who thought they already had a political
                    vocation, and we didn't get involved with Danny Cohn-Bendit or his friends
                    because nobody in the embassy went to university at Nanterre, the Sorbonne, or
                    any of those schools. So we did not anticipate it. I remember reading on the
                    back page of Le Monde just before leaving that there was a mention of
                    Cohn-Bendit for the first time, and it was really on the back page, the last
                    page, and it said that he was leading a march from Nanterre into the city. And
                    of course that was the one, or I think that was the one, that was one of the
                    major milestone of the uprising.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I think so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, he's German, and so he went back to Germany. I think he was
                    expelled from France, went back to Germany and made a political career for
                    himself in Germany, and now he successfully runs for European-wide offices. But
                    now he's quite a spellbinder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: He really got the kids enthused in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of our impression of the Socialist Party
                        anMitterrand and all that in this '65-68 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, at the time it didn't seem to have much future, the Socialist
                    Party. And it was headed by Guy Mollet, who had been discredited as prime
                    minister over Algeria. And Fran�ois Mitterrand was just regarded in the embassy
                    as kind of a condottiere, as a guy who'd take up a sword for anything that
                    promised him personal advancement. And so I don't think anybody in the embassy
                    saw the Socialists as a real alternative to De Gaulle, except insofar as you
                    could see Pierre Mend�s-France as somehow a come-back, because he was the only
                    Socialist of that era who had genuine respect, both domestically and
                    internationally, but he couldn't rally the troops, and so they really seemed to
                    be in sad shape. And I don't think anybody in the embassy in 1968 would have
                    picked Mitterrand to be president of France from '81 to '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was our involvement in Vietnam playing, as you
                        observed it,in France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it was playing very much as a David-Goliath sort of affair,
                    with Americans putting crushing numbers of soldiers and crushing superiority on
                    the Vietnamese. And so it was one of those clubs that the French, and the
                    Gaullists in particular, would use to attack us, for very similar reasons that
                    when you read French newspapers you see today. To them, we're either overbearing
                    or too strong or we push people around, so on and so forth. And the French have
                    had a relationship with the Vietnamese for 100 years or so, and there are a lot
                    of Vietnamese in Paris, and so they had a lot of sympathy from the French. So
                    Vietnam was a really big issue between the United States and France at the
                    time.</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: NATO was thrown out in '66.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '66. Did you find lingering resentment about it? Did
                        thihelp build up the anti- French feeling within the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I don't think so. I wouldn't characterize it - maybe I mistakenly
                    did - as an anti-French feeling. We welcomed opportunities where we could get
                    back at some of the slights or some of the attacks that we thought were
                    unwarranted, unjustified, but I don't know anyone in the Political Section or
                    the Economic Section, for that matter, who didn't like being in France, who
                    didn't like French people, individually and generally and all the other
                    advantages of life there. We did, however, have a big problem with support staff
                    in the embassy, because they were people that had served in smaller embassies
                    and were used to being part of an embassy family. There was no embassy family in
                    Paris, and they were sort of thrown on their own in this big city, and most of
                    them, probably nearly all of them, didn't have any French, and they never got
                    off to do much to improve it. And so we had a lot of people who would shorten
                    their tours, and who had problems of one sort or another. Very curious.</p>
                <p>Q: I imagine that you were hit with a lot of visitors, particularly Congressional
                    delegations and all, and when they weren't shopping or seeing the town, I would
                    think you normal American Congressman or political type of any kind would come
                    over and say, you know, be annoyed at the French, because the French were doing
                    things to annoy us. And did you find that you would have to say, “Well, let's
                    look at the long one,” or “Let's consider our real interests here”? Did you find
                    this was a role that you all had to play?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I can't recall. What I recall was when Bobby Kennedy came to Paris in
                    '67, I think, and the enthusiasm that he was greeted with, both within the
                    political class and generally in the county. See, the French would be very
                    distressed if they thought that Americans were anti-French in any way, because
                    they figure that the criticisms that they make of us are justified and so on,
                    and they don't like to receive criticism, so I don't recall... Bobby Kennedy
                    made a terrific impression. They couldn't get enough of him. Other Congressmen -
                    Hubert Humphrey came over. He didn't make much of an impression. Lyndon Johnson
                    came often when he was in the Senate. Congressmen and senators for the most
                    part, the ones that came over there were already fairly sophisticated people. If
                    they didn't like the French, they did not indulge in any attacks on them. Now I
                    had the impression, that they, at least over there anyway, displayed a lot of
                    forbearance. I can't recall now what... I think attitudes up on the Hill may
                    have been different, and speeches and things people put in the Congressional
                    Record - about the “ungrateful French.”</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, she's American. We met there, and we're stilmarried - 30-odd

                    She did all the VIP visits and arranged them, arranged hotels, transportation,

                    was that it was the big event - not of my generation, but the generation behind
                    me - of that period, so I thought I should go and see what it was all about.</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, I was in charge of what they call a New Life Development
                    Program. And this was all a translation from the Vietnamese of all of the
                    civilian programs that we put in there to try to make their government work
                    better - agricultural programs, public safety, budget, public works, every
                    aspect of a local county government that you can think of we probably had a
                    counterpart to it. We did have a counterpart to it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: When I arrived, I spent three days or so in Saigon, and Saigon was
                    being hit by rockets at the time, and there was a good deal of tension in
                    Saigon. And these were big rockets.</p>

                    they made a lot of noise. So the impression I had of it was kind of a tense
                    city, and then when I got out to My Tho, which was not the most appealing place
                    I had ever seen. I remember coming down by helicopter and looking at it and
                    thinking, What in the world have I let myself in for? Happily, it was just a far
                    more relaxed, far easier kind of place than Saigon.</p>

                        to do,and how did things work out? What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, I think we pretty much weren't told a hell of a lot of what you
                    were supposed to do. You kind of pick it up. All of these guys who were experts
                    in their job, and you were supposed to help them with it, make sure that they
                    got their shipments and so on. You became kind of an overall
                    controller-expediter, and you had to develop good relations with the provincial
                    government and with the U.S. military that was there. So we got involved... One
                    thing I really got interested in doing was public works, building bridges and so
                    on. We had this idea in the fall of '68 that if we could build little bridges
                    across drainage ditches and tiny streams and so on into villages that were
                    otherwise cut off, that they would be able to get their produce to the main
                    road, to the market, and the corollary was that the government would be able to
                    come from the main road into the village. And so we first talked to the Ninth
                    Division, and the Ninth Division said they noticed once that they had a whole
                    lot of metal lying around that they weren't using. I asked about it. It almost
                    looked like bridge sections. They weren't bridge sections, but they were pieces
                    that could go into making bridges. So I said, Can we use these, and they said
                    sure, welcome to them, just haul them away. We couldn't haul them away - they
                    were too heavy - so we got a helicopter. A big helicopter should do it. And then
                    we had a Seabee team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Construction Battalion team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, Navy Construction Battalion, a team of about 12 guys who were
                    all really good, cross-trained in all their specialty. And so we got these
                    things together and we went out and talked to villages and said, “Would you like
                    a bridge to make things easier for you?” And most of them said sure. So we built
                    the bridges, and then in March of 1969 they all got blown up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, they had sort of a Tet II offensive in late February or early
                    March, and all our little bridges got blown up. And so we went back and said,
                    “How come...” By this time we knew that the Vietcong never just turned up
                    suddenly. They always sent a guy out before hand with a little notebook and he'd
                    measure the abutments so they'd figure out how much C-4 plastic explosive they'd
                    need. So we said, “Why didn't you tell us when this guy comes around standing by
                    the bridge making notes measuring the abutments? Why didn't you let us know?”
                    Well, the basic reason boiled down to they didn't really think it was their
                    bridge. It was the American bridge, and they were not going to get into trouble
                    over the Americans' bridge. So at that point we said, okay, if the bridge is
                    going to be rebuilt, it will be by you guys. So I told the village chief we'd
                    provide some money for it, but apart from that we'd have nothing to do with
                    that. He would have to get the labor himself. So I probably learned from that
                    experience what every advisor before me and after me had learned, that you can't
                    do it yourself.</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: You can't do it as an American project. But then we did another one
                    which did last. It's a big bridge, about two hundred feet long, a pretty
                    good-sized bridge. It was across one of the tributaries of the Mekong, and it
                    opened up an area that we hadn't been in before. The Seabees built it, and one
                    of the things that I was able to do was to steal a pile-driver for them -
                    intercept a pile-driver - an old Eiffel. You know, Eiffel built the Eiffel
                    Tower, but Eiffel also even then was selling machinery in Southeast Asia, the
                    Eiffel Company. It was a little one-lung pile-driver with a two-stroke engine -
                    bum-bum- bum - that would pull the pile up and drop it - bang. It drove the
                    piles, built the bridge, and that still was standing in 1970. Might still be. I
                    don't know. I may go back and take a look for it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find relations were with the Vietnamese, both
                        thmilitary and the civilian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Vietnamese?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It depended on the military unit. You had your elite units, your
                    Vietnamese Marine or Airborne or Ranger outfits were just different as night and
                    day from local troops. As it was in the Army. Have you been in the Army?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in the Air Force, enlisted man.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I think the units that we worked with were mostly the popular force
                    and regional force. The regional force were the companies that could be used
                    anywhere in our province, and the popular force were restricted to their village
                    for operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your time like that you were working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: We had a large team with about, oh, I guess maybe about 100 people or
                    so, and maybe about 15-20 civilians and the rest military. So I think we got
                    along pretty well. There were sometimes towards the end there, when I remember I
                    got my orders to go back to Washington, and I couldn't get out for a while. What
                    I was going to do, my wife and I were going to go to Phnom Penh and then down to
                    what is it, the big... you know, where the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Angkor Wat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Angkor Wat. And we had our visas and everything for that, and then we
                    had to cancel that because of our invasion in 1970, April, '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was May or April.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: April, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: April, '70.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: So then I said, well, I'll get out of here in June and we'll go back
                    through Europe for a month or so and then I'll come back to Washington. Well, I
                    had my orders to depart, but because it's a military outfit they wouldn't let me
                    go until my replacement turned up, so that caused a little strain. I went to
                    John Paul Vann and I said, “I've got my orders and I'm supposed to get out of
                    here. I've been here two years.” I was getting a little antsy, and because by
                    that time we'd gone through what seemed like three different sets of military
                    advisors and they all were able to get out when their time came up... So I had
                    to wait and finally got a replacement. At the replacement, I threw my stuff in a
                    box, put it in the back of a Scout and left for Saigon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Philippines. Were you ever under attack, or not,
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: In Vietnam?</p>
                <p>'Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes, yes. It was pretty mild stuff. There were mortar attacks
                    basically. We got mortared fairly frequently, and we got ambushed once, and I
                    still like to tell that story of our ambush, and I had to get out of the Scout
                    and jump into the rice paddy, which is not such a benign place to jump into if
                    the rice patty is just full of human waste basically, and fired back. And then
                    we got out of there. There was a truck in front of us with a .50 caliber machine
                    gun, and somebody got up and was working that. And we got about a mile down the
                    road and there was some kind of officer - a U.S. Ranger officer - and we were
                    kind of dirty and a little bit shaken. He gave us each a beer, a cold Budweiser.
                    This was probably at 11 in the morning. And I lit up - I smoked at the time - I
                    lit up a Marlboro and took a drag on that, and I swear to God, the smoke went
                    all the way down to my toes and back up - the best drag I've ever had on a
                    cigarette - and the beer tasted as good as anything I've ever had - better. I
                    guess at the time the greatest fear I had was driving down a road that was on a
                    berm. I could see far enough ahead. There was a roadblock, and the guys on the
                    roadblock, I couldn't see what kind of weapons they had, but I could see the
                    weapons had banana clips, which was a feature of the AK-47, and I thought, I'm
                    done for. So I had the M-16, had that loaded, cocked, and I was going to drive
                    on and see if I could drive on through. And it turned out they were our people,
                    our Vietnamese, who had welded or soldered the magazine so it wasn't a square
                    magazine, but a banana clip on the M-16. That was a big relief. So anyway, we
                    left.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm trying to portray this life. I mean, here were a bunch of essentially
                    civilian diplomats out driving jeeps in very dangerous country.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, but it was interesting times, anyway.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting some of the new officers? You were getting young Foreign
                    Service officers coming in, weren't you? I've often thought, you know, we were
                    getting some of these guys had been protesting or demonstrating in the streets
                    in the United States against the war six months before, and then they went to be
                    nice cushy diplomats and the next thing they know they were in My Tho or some
                    other place like that driving around. What was the spirit, morale, or whatever
                    you'd like to talk about?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I don't recall that we ever got anybody down there. Howard Gross and
                    I were the only Foreign Service officers in My Tho. Then we had one guy also a
                    Foreign Service officer down the road in Vinit Kiem, and then everybody else was
                    an AID officer. And it was an AID Foreign Service reserve, but I never ran into
                    anybody who thought, My God, no, I went into the diplomatic service and here I
                    am. And the Foreign Service officers up at the embassy always struck me as
                    pretty dedicated to the effort. So I never ran into anybody like that.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned Howard Gross. Howard took me on a tour of his bridges. I
                    remember this. I came from the embassy to My Tho, and Howard and I had served
                    together in Yugoslavia. We probably met at that point, but Howard took me out to
                    see his bridges. He was very proud of these. I was very antsy because I was a
                    Saigon type, and I hadn't been out in the-</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: He called them his bridges, Howard did?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I know, his bridges - I mean I just remember he took
                        me tbridges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, those were my bridges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they were your bridges. Well, he took me to
                        bridges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And showing me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, I used to have the exact opposite impression. I was more at
                    ease in the country than I was in Saigon. I'd get up to Saigon and have the
                    feeling of being a country boy in a very big and bustling city. I didn't know my
                    way around, and I didn't like it very much. And I'd go to the embassy or go to
                    AID headquarters and think, what am I doing here? What are these guys doing
                    here? You remember that AID complex? They had guys there that I don't think knew
                    what they were doing. They'd come down every once in a while to My Tho, which
                    was close in, and want to take a look at a village. It might be the chief of the
                    Village Development Division of AID. You know, “That's a village, eh. That's
                    what it looks like.” But they were interesting times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you left there in 1970, how did you feel things
                        wergoing? Whither Vietnam in your opinion at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was pretty confident that we had turned the tables on the war, that
                    the Vietcong had hurt themselves tremendously in 1968, and many of their cadres
                    had been killed in this tremendous uprising. The Vietnamese Army never looked
                    particularly good, but at least it looked as if it was big enough, heavy enough
                    that it couldn't be overturned, and it seemed to be there was more peace in the
                    Delta most of the time. Some exceptions where they'd have a hard-core Vietcong
                    or NVA battalion would come through, and they were very, very tough and very
                    difficult to... They could really inflict damage on our local troops. The
                    consequence was that we would have to have South Vietnam Marines or Airborne or
                    Rangers down to match them. And we were the first, the Delta was the first part
                    of Vietnam from which our troops were withdrawn, beginning in '69, and so it was
                    a sort of a cockpit of Vietnamization. And it really seemed as though things
                    were going pretty well. I left there and figured I'd never have to go back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about corruption? How did you feel about that, or
                        what diyou observe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes, there certainly was corruption, but it didn't affect... It
                    was really pretty much a Vietnamese thing, Vietnamese demanding money from other
                    Vietnamese. But we would... There were things we didn't know. We didn't know,
                    for example, why the budget had been proclaimed up in Saigon and yet our
                    province didn't have its budget for months and months and months. As it turned
                    out, it was either being lent out along the way at exorbitant interest rates or
                    it was being ripped off. But where I was the corruption didn't seem to be all
                    that much. I mean it was not... This was really out in the country, out in the
                    sticks, and we didn't seem to have as much there. Now I guess up in Saigon you
                    must have had a good deal of it. It must have been endemic, but I never had the
                    impression that it was really affecting daily operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you want to do, and how did you want to sort of
                        direcyourself when you were getting out in 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, Howard had told me a lot about Yugoslavia, and I wanted to get
                    back to Europe, so about that time, sometime in early '70, John Burns, the
                    director general of the Foreign Service came out, and he saw everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: He came down to this little room I was in, and he said, “Well, where
                    would you like to go after Vietnam, after your tour here?” And I thought, Wow,
                    that's a pretty nice offer. And I said, “Tell me, where do you have me pegged to
                    go now?” And he had a guy with him, and he asked the guy, and the guy says,
                    “Indonesian language training.” And I said, “I'd much prefer to go back to
                    Europe.” At that time, I had thought that I had done my overseas service. And I
                    thought, well, one of the ways I can beat the rule that requires domestic
                    service is to go back for hard language training and then go back overseas. And
                    only years and years later - I think you'll like this - I discovered that as far
                    as the State Department was concerned, service in Vietnam counted as domestic
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? I didn't know that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: You didn't know that? It counted as domestic because the State
                    Department had, in effect, assigned you to AID, but that transaction had taken
                    place in Washington, and then what AID did with you after that was of no concern
                    of the State Department. So basically it was domestic service, so I could have
                    really said, “I'd like to go back to France,” or “I'd like to go to Italy,” or
                    something like that. But I picked Yugoslavia for that reason, and enjoyed
                    that.</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, Key Boulevard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Father Milosevic and Mr. Jankovic - remember Janko?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: And Popovic was the voice on the tape. We never haPopovic as a
                    teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You missed something - not much, but you missed
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: At the time we used to have to drive down as a department and listen
                    to the tapes in the Department. And listen to Mr. Popovic say “Dobur dan!” And
                    he was supposed to be... If the king's folks had won and dominated or managed to
                    dominate after the end of World War II he was going to be the interior
                    minister.</p>
                <p>Q: He would have been a very good minister under Milosevic, too, for the
                    interior. He was a very inflexible person. As a matter of fact, I found him a
                    very good source for understanding Yugoslavia later on - almost revolted against
                    him. In fact, a group of us had taken... We were assigned to Popovic; we were
                    not allowed to study with Jankovic, and we ended up revolting and asking that
                    the classes be mixed, much to their dismay.</p>
                <p>Just to end this phase of learning about the language, what were yopicking up
                    from your teaching and reading about Yugoslavia?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, I guess what I was picking up there was the kind of myth that
                    the Yugoslavs like to portray of themselves as rugged and stalwart defenders of
                    their country against the Germans and that sort of thing. They're very proud of
                    that. I just got the impression from Janko about a country that was a vigorous
                    and happy place, and he was very sad that he couldn't go back to it because of
                    the political situation. Our other professor was Father Milosevic, a Serbian
                    Orthodox priest, but a man with a great sense of humor and jolly, a heavy-set
                    fellow. And you got nothing whatsoever from either of them of any kind of
                    internal stress between Croats, Serbs, Slovenes, and so on, except in kind of a
                    joking way like Serbian recruits in the army ask how many pairs of undershorts
                    they want. A person somewhere says, one, two, three, and then finally a guy from
                    Macedonia says, “I'll nee12,” and then, “What do you need 12 for?” and he says,
                    “Januar, Februar...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, the months. So it was that kind of a... you got that kind of
                    impression of it, and you had really no sense of underlying animosity... nor for
                    that matter did I get much sense of what ___________ between the nationalities
                    when I got to Belgrade. The Croats in '71 had a nationalist phase, and it wasn't
                    even really an uprising. They just had some people out in the square, and that
                    was repressed very harshly. And the Serbians, the government in Belgrade, was
                    always very concerned about the Ustasi. They had an incursion of people from
                    Australia and Canada into the Bosnian mountains, all of whom were either killed
                    or captured and then executed. But you know, you never really felt any deep
                    hatred. One of the few times I've really been shocked was looking at a Time
                    Magazine on a plane coming back from Paris in '91, I think, and it showed
                    pictures of guys with masks on and combat fatigues with the dead civilians
                    they'd just killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Bosnia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes. It was after the war with the Slovenians and after the Vukovar
                    battle with the Croats. And this was just guys that had come down in the mud and
                    they'd killed all these... Bijeljina - it was at Bijeljina, in Bosnia... killed
                    all these old folks, lying there, and there was a picture of a guy with an AK-47
                    taking a kick at the head of one of these dead people. And I said, these are not
                    the Serbs I knew.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: They were solid and very hardy and rugged folks, but you didn't think
                    they would go after old women and old geezers [men], but they did. And so you
                    just had to reexamine our feelings about the Serbs. We loved Serbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, we did, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: We had a marvelous time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had five years there, and just loved it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Our kids loved it. Our kids learned to play soccer with Yugoslav
                    kids. I used to run sports programs there, and I'd seek out Yugoslav kids to
                    come and play soccer. They taught the American kids; they also didn't take any
                    guff either. And I just thought they were terrific people. But of all the
                    countries I served in, I think that would be the one I would not go back to at
                    this time. I'd have a hard time with that. Have you been back?</p>
                <p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: When?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Last year and the year before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, okay. How do you find it?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it's a different world, just a different world. I find I had very little
                    sympathy... I have no sympathy for the Serbs. Some of my fellow officers who
                    served there, I think, can't get rid of that bonding or something, but I
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I just could have no sympathy whatsoever for anybody that did that.
                    And I'm sorry, in a way, that in this war that we have just waged in Kosovo we
                    didn't come to grips with these people, the Captain Arkans and Seselj crowd.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me stop here. We'll pick this up the next time. We've talked a bit about
                    your time in language training in 1970-71 and all about what you were picking up
                    from it, and we'll go to when you went to Serbia, or to Yugoslavia, in 1971.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was there from 1971 to 1974.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was an economic officer and covered pretty mucwhatever anybody
                    wanted done on economics, from oil to trade to -</p>
                <p>

                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes, quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: When I got there it was Bill Leonhart, and very shortly after I got
                    there he was called back and was replaced by Malcolm Toon, who was the
                    ambassador for the three years that we were there. And I think I met Leonhart
                    once, just on arriving there. And he had, as you know, had a major problem with
                    his DCM, who was Tom Enders, and he got rid of Tom Enders, but shortly
                    thereafter the Administration called him back and replaced him with Toon.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a very well-known blow-up. I mean, I think it had been growing for a
                    while but it happened at a country team meeting before your time. But was the
                    aftermath of this sort of hanging around when you arrived? How would you
                    describe sort of the mood of the embassy and what you were getting?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it was kind of curious because they had pro-Enders and anti-
                    Enders groups, and people would invite you into their office, close the door,
                    and then tell you in hushed tone what had happened at such and such a time
                    between Enders and Leonhart, and who had wronged whom. It was really quite a
                    show. I didn't have anything to do with it. I wasn't there long enough to pick a
                    side or to have a side picked for me, but I was very happy that I didn't have to
                    go through that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the problem at all what we would call “substantive,”
                        or wathis just purely personality as far as your -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I think it was purely personality, from what I heard. There may have
                    been some substance involved, but it just was two people who apparently simply
                    did not get along with one another and had apparently developed a very strong,
                    more than just dislike but almost a hatred of one another. They apparently could
                    barely be civil in each other's company. It was really a curious affair. It was
                    nice to avoid.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Malcolm Toon as the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: He was really quite good, really professional. He was a very, very
                    tough guy. He always prided himself on that. He was later ambassador to Moscow,
                    and the Russians refused to accept him for about almost a year, nine months or
                    so, because he was so very, very tough with them, and he was known as a man who
                    enjoyed giving them bad news and, indeed, never shrank from giving anybody bad
                    news. As I say, he was a very tough guy, very forceful fellow.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel he came with an attitude? I think he'd had previous Soviet
                    experience, and my impression was, I remember, when Spike Dubs came to Belgrade
                    from Moscow, he had sort of a carryover, thinking that Yugoslavia was a
                    miniature Soviet Union for a while, and things just were really so different
                    that it took a little while to sort of adjust to it. Did you find this at all
                    with Toon?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I had the sense he was flexible enough to come into a place like
                    Yugoslavia, assess it, assess its leadership, find out very quickly how it
                    worked, and as in the Soviet Union, it was the Party in Yugoslavia that made
                    things happen, and then the superstructure, to use a communist term, that we all
                    dealt with. Actually, the League of Communists was very closed to the embassy.
                    We could only very rarely go and talk to one of the people who were running the
                    party, you know, somebody like Stane Dolanc. There was also a screwy guy that
                    was the ideologue, who used to go on television every once in a while and spout
                    real nonsense, and sometimes I would translate that, because Workers'
                    self-management was the big deal and had some kind of resonance in the West in
                    France. There was a lot of theory about it, and I'd sometimes have to translate
                    the stuff and put it into English and send it to the States, and I remember Toon
                    saying to me once, “Bill, this is a load of crap.” And I said, “Well, I can't
                    help it. It's not my writing; it's...” I can't remember the fellow's name now,
                    but he was the number two or the number three to Tito.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Kardelj?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, it was Kardelj, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Edvard Kardelj, yes. He was Slovenian, I think, wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, what an obscurantist he was. He never made sense, never used a
                    simple word when he could use a complicated one. Did we ever discuss the
                    language training?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, we did. Did I tell you the story about coming to Yugoslavia and
                    our teacher - remember Mr. Jankovic, and he had come from éabac - did I tell you
                    that story?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you tell it again? We can eliminate it if
                        necessary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: And he'd grown up in éabac, which at the time, I guess before the
                    war, had cultural pretensions as a competitor, challenger to Belgrade. And of
                    course after the war, éabac sank into obscurity and became a pig-farming center,
                    a hog-raising center, and Jankovic's Serbian never changed. He was pre-war and
                    had a éabac accent, and so a generation of Foreign Service officers apparently
                    went to Yugoslavia with a really rustic accent, out-of-date Serbian that was
                    pre-war, never really learned how to use the intimate verbs. And we had this
                    wonderful lady in the embassy - I think she was probably there when you were
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Angelovic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Madame Angelovic, who took us all in hand and he taughus Serbian. It
                    was like a finishing course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in 1971, what was the
                        political-economisituation in Yugoslavia as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Right after I arrived, there was a challenge in Croatia to Tito or
                    tot the Communist Party. It was a nationalist movement in Zagreb that was a
                    pretty mild sort of movement, but it was put down very harshly by Tito, who
                    realized - as we've seen since - that any kind of insurgent nationalism can have
                    very serious impact on the other nationalities within Yugoslavia. And so he shut
                    that down pretty hard, put people in jail, broke up demonstrations, all sorts of
                    things. Then in '72, another curious event hat I recall was the invasion of the
                    Ustasi. Fifteen or so heavily-armed guys came in from Austria, who were Croats
                    from Canada, Australia. They came in and they took over a little town up in the
                    mountains in Croatian Bosnia, way up in the mountains. They took that over for a
                    couple of days, and then the police and the army came in and wiped them out,
                    captured a lot of them, and then held them incommunicado, and then apparently
                    interrogated them pretty thoroughly to find out who had sent them, who had
                    financed them. For about three or four months they thought that the Americans
                    were behind it, but they never released any of the testimony and, as a matter of
                    fact, shot everybody that they had captured. It really was a “dead men tell no
                    tales” sort of thing that took place.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>But it could be a very suspicious place. Another thing that we had at that time
                    was the detente with the Russians, and the Russians embassy was a large embassy
                    there, larger than ours, and they put on a real charm offensive, and Toon was
                    sensitive enough to realize that this kind of thing bothered the Yugoslavs.
                    You'd see the Americans and the Russians having lunch together, at receptions in
                    honor of one another, so he'd sort of tried to damp that down a little bit. But
                    it was an interesting time. Every country I've been to I've really enjoyed being
                    in for one reason or another, even Vietnam. It's just a marvelous place, and I'm
                    sorry we didn't make more of it than we did. But Yugoslavia was a terrific
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the economy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it worked to some degree, because people were willing to
                    overlook a lot of things. They had tremendous problems. They owed debt to one
                    another within the country, and they never paid it off. They'd just keep on
                    building the debt. Finally, it just seized the whole economy up. But they were
                    very open to imports. They also had, I thought, a very poor banking system.
                    That's one of the things I followed. I got to know all of the people that ran
                    the National Bank because I could speak Serbian. These guys preferred to speak
                    either English or French, which I could also speak, so I'd go over there. I
                    remember one time I was supposed to have an interview. It was supposed to talk
                    to the man who was known as the “Gray Fox of the National Bank.” He was the guy
                    who did their foreign exchange dealings. And I got over there, and they said,
                    “Well, he's not available.” And I said, “But I've got an appointment with him.”
                    And he said, “Well, he's off listening to a lecture by Milton Friedman.” And
                    then another guy I tracked down was somebody over in the Plan, in the Ministry
                    of the Economy, I guess it was, who was in charge figuring out the prices for
                    all the inputs of industry everywhere in Yugoslavia. And I went and saw him and
                    met him a few times. He was very interesting. He was a professor, a Macedonian,
                    but he was absolutely... I figured he was a little bit nuts, because he didn't
                    have a computer, and he tried to figure out the relationship of all these input
                    prices, one to the other, and could never get them all right, so he'd get
                    something wrong and the farmers, for example, would start to drive their cattle
                    across the border to Italy to sell it rather than sell it this artificially low
                    decreed price. But there were always things like that. A couple of people came
                    to see me once and they said, “We have a proposal to make to you for developing
                    a nickel-mining operation in Macedonia.” They said, “This is a surefire thing.
                    All we need is $200 million.” And so they gave me a one-page prospectus on this
                    and said, “Well, what do you think?” I said, “Well, that's not the way to get
                    $200 million from international lenders - or from anyone. You really have to
                    have it studied, looked into.” But believe it or not that actually became a
                    project. Somebody did lend them the money; they built the... Actually, it's down
                    in Kosovo, the northern part of Kosovo, in Kosovska Mitrovica or somewhere, or
                    Trepca, and it's a great big nickel facility, and it did get built. It was also
                    the kind of country that foreign lenders liked because it was developing, there
                    was a cadre of people who had been to school in the West who seemed to know what
                    they were doing. It was a relatively open society. It was just streets ahead of
                    everybody else in Eastern Europe, so people liked to come and lend to it. It was
                    an interesting economy.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, what would you tell an American who came in and said, “I'm interested in
                    opening up either a trade relation or a factory or something here in
                    Yugoslavia”?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, you'd have to look around for a reliable partner, somebody who
                    could help you through the regulations. I'd translated all of the banking
                    regulations in to English for people, and some of them didn't make any sense no
                    matter what you did with the translation, and I went and asked this fellow, the
                    Gray Fox, and I said, “What is the meaning of this? I don't understand this.”
                    And he said, “You're not supposed to understand it. It was written that way.
                    That was not to be followed, not to be understood; it was just to make people
                    come see us, and then we make the decisions.” To American businessmen, I'd say
                    be very careful, somebody looking to invest in Yugoslavia, find a reliable local
                    partner. There were outside organizations - the World Bank. There was an
                    Investment Corporation of Yugoslavia that Tony Solomon ran. Go check with them
                    and find somebody reliable, but then don't throw all of your money into it. Be
                    very careful with it. It was a kind of an economy that lent itself to anecdotal
                    evidence. The statistics were baloney for the most part and did not take into
                    account all of these payments that had seized up between companies. And as I
                    say, I followed the banks, and the local banks had sort of a Western fa�ade to
                    them. You know, you'd go in and do a foreign exchange transaction sometimes and
                    they were reasonable, but of the six major banks, I remember one time a U.S.
                    banker came in and said, “What's going on with this bank?” and I said, “Well,
                    the manager's just absconded to Western Europe with a lot of money.” He said,
                    “What about this one?” “Oh, the president is in jail.” But there was always a
                    lot of corruption, peculation, cooking books, and so on. Which is why you needed
                    somebody reliable to make your way there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find the self-governing enterprise
                        systeworked in reality? Were you able to get a fix on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, pretty much so for the self-governing workers-governed plant or
                    factory, the real final arbiter of most arguments or difficulties was the local
                    Party rep, and all of this other superstructure was just that - and very
                    complicated. They had levels of representation and a lot of workers involved in
                    it, and I guess in that sense, if you weren't very sophisticated, you'd think
                    that was the way it ran, but basically, if they did have an investment problem
                    or had a real labor relations problem, you went to the Party, and the Party
                    decided at the local level, and if they couldn't do it, then they took it to the
                    municipality and then further up.</p>
                <p>It was a fascinating place, and another thing we liked about it, my wife and I,
                    was that of the many places we'd been it was the one that had one of the closest
                    most cohesive diplomatic communities in it. Do you recall that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, very much so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: We're still friends with some of the people we made acquaintance with
                    in Yugoslavia. We'd go out. There was an English-speaking hunting group. There
                    was a French-speaking hunting group, tennis tournaments. They had all sorts of
                    things going on, and they did a lot of parties and a lot of smaller embassies
                    were there that didn't have any idea what was going on... that were kind of
                    clueless, and nobody spoke Serbian and so on. So they were always happy to hear
                    what sort of opinions we had of the place.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you able to make trips out into the country?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes, quite a lot, and we used to go pheasant hunting down in
                    Bosnia, down around Brcko. A lovely area, you go out, and there were always... I
                    spoke Serbian, but the embassy always wanted you to go out with someone else.
                    They didn't want you to go out into the country by yourself, so I always went
                    with my assistant, whom you've probably met - Anda Miloslavjevic, who used to
                    work... Well, anyway-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I knew him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: -he used to go out with me, and we'd go various places, all over, and
                    the Ministry of Finance would always send this very small and timid man to come
                    along with us so there'd be three of us, and he, it turned out, was a sort of an
                    agent for the UDBA, the secret police at the time, and would report on what we
                    were doing. We weren't doing anything... you know, we weren't going around
                    taking pictures of sensitive installations. So we'd go out in this trio, and I
                    remember we went to Kosovo Polje at one point in time. I just wanted to see
                    that. And I remember Anda Miloslavjevic, who was a fairly sophisticated guy,
                    burst into tears when he was on the Kosovo Polje. You know, the battle the Serbs
                    lost 600 years earlier. So we'd go around, we'd talk to municipality officials,
                    we talked to businesses, and always do it in Serbo-Croatian, unless we ran
                    across somebody who was really good in English. And I always got a good
                    reception, partially because we had the secret police guy with us. Anybody give
                    us a problem, they'd have a bigger one in return. And the secret police guy was
                    a very nice, very gentle little man. It turned out that he had some years
                    earlier been picked up, thrown in jail by the UDBA, just beaten unmercifully, so
                    much so that he apparently could not stand to be by himself once darkness fell,
                    and so he'd always come into Anda's room and sleep in Andre's room. There wasn't
                    anything going on between them, but he was just afraid of the dark and so badly
                    brutalized by the cops.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Sometimes we'd go someplace and somebody would just... any question we asked, the
                    reply would be some sort of doctrinal thing, you know, “As Edvard Kardelj has
                    said...” but for the most part people were happy to see us, seemed to be,
                    anyway. One of the jobs I had, I got about $1000 a year in travel money from
                    AID. They wanted somebody to go around and look at all of the projects that
                    they'd built and see if they were still there - the steel mills in Skopje, the
                    dam up above Dubrovnik, you know, that sort of thing - and I thought, fine. I
                    had a four-wheel drive vehicle, I'd just go all over the place and stay in
                    little hotels in little towns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get over into Croatia, Slovenia at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Not much, just we did a... we'd go through there. Of course, they
                    have a consulate in Zagreb, and they covered those two areas pretty thoroughly.
                    We'd just drive through. My wife and I would make two runs a year to the PX up
                    in-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aviano?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Near Aviano - it was Vicenza. And we'd go through Croatia and
                    Slovenia and then in to Italy, and each step of the way there was more electric
                    lighting, the roads were wider, better. You know, the whole thing, sort of
                    observable degrees of economic development got better until finally you went to
                    Italy and got into Italy and it was really so much brighter than towns like
                    Belgrade. We'd go up there, and we'd do a day's PX shopping. We had three kids.
                    We'd fill up our station wagon with stuff, and then to entice my wife to do
                    this, I'd always promise her dinner in Venice. So we'd put all the stuff in the
                    room and take the car down to Venice, take the boat, and have a nice dinner.</p>
                <p>Q: How was our consulate general in Zagreb reporting on this clampdown on
                    Croatian nationalism? Was our consulate general seeing a different Yugoslavia
                    than you all were seeing it in Belgrade, do you think?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I don't think so. I think he was just seeing another aspect of...
                    We could tell that this r�gime had some very serious concerns about nationalism
                    and regional differences. But as far as I could tell, there was no conflict
                    between the consulate and the embassy, as I recall. I may be wrong. Most of the
                    reporting from the consulate came through the embassy before it went back to
                    Washington, and so, no, I never noticed, or I never picked up any real
                    dissension between the two posts.</p>
                <p>Q: Later, of course, these things we're talking about now - we're talking in 1999
                    - and Western Europe and the United States have been very heavily involved in
                    the breakup of Yugoslavia - did you get any feel for the divisions in that
                    society?</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I never did, and the funny thing is that both my wife and I spoke
                    Serbian. We had Serbian friends. We traveled a lot within Serbia. We liked the
                    place. We knew the people. People could tell that we liked it, so that helps
                    them to be more open. We always admired the Serbs, thought the Serbs were
                    terrific, straightforward, gutsy people. But you got a sense that a lot of
                    history had passed between these people, but you never had any slightest inkling
                    that they would ever take after each other the way they did. And I remember one
                    of the most shocking things I've ever seen was coming back on a plane from Paris
                    to Washington after a meeting in Paris and reading Newsweek, which I never read.
                    I picked it up on the plane and read it, and I saw a picture of one of Captain
                    Arkans' people in Bijeljina, in Bosnia, and it was just after they'd finished
                    killing some unarmed civilians, and they were lying in the street-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the Bosnian-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, this was '91, right in the beginning. And this one guy, this
                    thuggish looking guy, was kicking one of these dead people in the head. I think
                    you'd recall the picture if you saw it again. I was shocked by that. I said I
                    couldn't believe that Serbs could do this sort of thing. I always thought that
                    they were... because they had propagated this myth that they had fought the
                    Germans to a standstill in World War II, which as it turns out was a myth. The
                    Germans only had a few divisions in Yugoslavia, and for the most part these guys
                    fought each other. But still the myth lasts that they were brave and forthright
                    kind of people that wouldn't kill women and kids and old people, but it turns
                    out that they did. But you didn't have the impression going around Yugoslavia
                    that this sort of thing was just beneath the surface, but it must have been.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting a feel towards - now we call them the Kosovars or the
                    Albanians there; we called them Sciptars in those times - I guess it was a
                    derogatory term - but did you get any feel towards the Serb attitude towards
                    those people at that time?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, Serbs didn't much like them, but at that time Kosovo was
                    autonomous within the Federal Republic, and so they had rights there. They had
                    rights until Milosevic took them away in '88-89. But it was dirt poor. It was
                    really a dirt-poor area. There wasn't much going on there economically, and so
                    we would go down to Pristina sometimes and talk to people. We didn't spend a lot
                    of time down there. It didn't seem like there was much going on. And there was
                    no or very little Serb-Albanian... Serbs and Albanians didn't mix but they
                    didn't seem to... they weren't at daggers-drawn - or at least not to an
                    outsider. Have you been back?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes, you told me that. That's right. I'm not sure I'd want to go
                    back. It's one of the only places I've been, I think, that I wouldn't want to go
                    back to because Serbs that we knew would talk sometimes about Kosovo Polje and
                    it's a historical kind of thing, and people talk about the Civil War here. But
                    then who knows who you're talking to. How they managed to elect a government
                    like Milosevic and support or at least tolerate people like Seselj and Arkans
                    and thug outfits like that.</p>
                <p>Q: I have to say that I had a wonderful time, same as you, but I don't have any
                    feeling of sympathy for the Serbs. I mean I find myself, these people, as a
                    people, unfortunately, are responsible for some of the greatest horrors
                    certainly in Western Europe.</p>
                <p>Well, then, in '74, whither?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Back to Washington, in '74 to '77, and I went to the economics course
                    at FSI and then went from there to the Bureau of Economic Affairs and worked
                    '75-77 in the Office of International Commodities, which was active at the time
                    because we were doing issues like the Common Fund, the CIEC discussions with
                    developing countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, that's the Conference on International Economic Cooperation, and
                    it was something that was forced on us by the oil producers in '75, who were
                    looking for some way to spread the blame for higher oil prices and the impact of
                    the prices on developing countries. And so they got us to go along with a
                    two-year cycle of conferences to see what could be done to help the developing
                    countries, but it took a lot of time and a lot of work. And then the Common Fund
                    was a UN idea that countries would contribute substantial amounts of money to
                    help stabilize primary commodities so that they would not have the fluctuations
                    that you have, you know, very high prices followed by very low prices. But that
                    never worked because they always wanted to - insofar as you could figure out
                    what an equilibrium price was - they would always... they couldn't agree on it
                    because the producer countries of one product or another always wanted a higher
                    equilibrium price. It's sort of an effort to suspend the laws of supply and
                    demand, and it couldn't be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the impetus coming from for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It originally came from the developing countries and the
                    oil-producing countries and some of the larger developing countries - countries
                    like India, Algeria, Latin American countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Q: Well, this was the end of the Nixon-Ford time. How was the State Department
                    responding to these efforts to it? Were we just doing it because we felt we had
                    to be there, or were we trying to work with them?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, we participated with an effort to try to put some aspect of
                    reason into it, make sure that it wasn't going to cost a huge amount of our
                    money and that it wasn't going to screw up the international economy. And I
                    think we were pretty successful at that. The whole edifice crashed about early
                    '77, the whole CIEC conference crashed. The Common Fund idea never got off the
                    ground. Although we signed it in 1979, it really never got... we never
                    contributed any money to it, and it never really got going. And there was a sort
                    of time when a sort of new international economic order, and that was pretty
                    much an attempt to put a template of government control over international trade
                    and finance activities, and we said no, we're not going to do it. So we fought
                    against it and managed to either neuter it or kill it off.</p>
                <p>Q: How were some of the major trading countries - ourselves, Germany, France,
                    Japan, Great Britain - how were they responding to all this?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, they always keyed on us, and we would be assumed to always take
                    the most right-wing position, and then countries like France and Germany - the
                    European countries - and Japan would always take a position nuanced from that
                    and more towards the developing countries, who were united then in the Group of
                    77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: and less ideological than we were presumed to be. And there was
                    expectation that that would change after the end of the Ford Administration,
                    Ford and Kissinger departed. And to some degree it did. There was an effort to
                    be more accommodating to developing countries, but by that time nobody really
                    had their heart in it. We did, as I say, sign this Common Fund agreement in
                    1979, but it never went anywhere - happily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of the feeling within the Economic Bureau
                        thathis all sounds fine but it's going against the economic tides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It didn't even sound fine. We had within the government ferocious
                    fights with the Treasury Department over policy. In that sense we didn't like
                    these ideas any better than Treasury did, but Treasury always had a very hard
                    ideological position with Bill Simon, the Treasury Secretary, and so we used to
                    have ferocious fights, really, about the nuances of our policy, how we would
                    approach something. The State Department would always try to sugar the pill a
                    little bit, but the pill was always very bitter as far as developing countries
                    were concerned. The Treasury Department always said, “Just shove that pill down
                    their throats.”</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Q: Was the feeling sort of that this was India and other countries that
                    essentially wanted us to take the losses or what have you and pass it on to
                    them?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, basically they wanted a transfer of resources from the developed
                    countries, the rich countries, to the poor countries. And they wanted those
                    resources in the form of assistance, either official assistance or unofficial
                    assistance in terms of price maintenance and so on. And at that time the level
                    of official assistance in developing countries from the United States started
                    down, and even then, I think, people were beginning to realize that it didn't
                    really work. So basically that's what it was. It's very essence was an argument
                    over transfer of resources. We didn't want to transfer the resources, and we
                    certainly didn't want to transfer them in this under-the-table way of
                    maintaining prices, because it just would hurt us, and it wouldn't
                    necessarily... as the old expression goes, one of these price-maintenance
                    agreements would be taking money from the poor in a rich country and handing it
                    to the rich in a poor country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: The plantation owners and so on. The coffee growers.So I spent three
                    years doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling you were fighting a rear-guard
                        guerillaction or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, we really though we were winning the war. These people weren't
                    going to get any of our money. These proposals were going to be stuck back in
                    their box, and they were. It was successful.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the Economic Bureau at this time? Did you find it was a well-
                    managed organization and people knew what they were doing?</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: For the most part, yes, I think so. It was very well run. Jules Katz
                    had been in it for so long he knew everything everywhere and knew where all the
                    bodies were buried. So it ran pretty well, and it had authority within the
                    Department. In part, the State Department had immense authority at the time
                    because Henry Kissinger ran it, and you always knew if you had a real policy
                    disagreement, say with Treasury Department or somewhere else in the government
                    and it couldn't be resolved at a lower level, it would gradually go up, and
                    Kissinger was so smart and his influence was so great that he would - if you had
                    to take it up there - he'd win it for you. And so there was a real esprit de
                    corps. Working for a guy that good was just terrific. The State Department
                    was... We actually had people say, “I want to work for the Bureau of Economic
                    Affairs because I want to learn how to roll over people.” So it was interesting,
                    but the problem with Washington at the time was prices were going up, but the
                    salaries weren't. By 1976, I said, we've got to get out of town, or I've got to
                    quit, or I've got to get a second job, something. I had three kids, one in
                    private school, the other two in elementary school in upper Northwest DC. Second
                    finishing elementary school and then the problem of where to put him for high
                    school. So I decided to lobby for an overseas post and got assigned to
                    Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were doing that, what was the role of
                        oil? Now it was all impacting on what you were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes, very much so. Oil was the single commodity where the
                    producers had managed to get together and take control of the market and impose
                    their scheme of things on prices. They kept raising prices, and finally another
                    crisis came to pass in 1979-80 with Iran. But the oil prices were what drove the
                    whole Economic Bureau at time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the oil expert cadre in the
                        EconomiBureau at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, it was first-rate. Steve Bosworth ran the oil operation, and I
                    worked for him in the commodities office, and he was just as good in his way as
                    Katz and Kissinger, just as smart, just as sharp, just as hard-working. And at
                    that time everybody in the Economic Bureau worked late at night. If you got out
                    at seven o'clock you felt you were a shirker. And so it was an interesting place
                    to work and again, the finances were such that you couldn't really stay in
                    Washington and survive with three kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Brussels in '77, and you were there till
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was at the embassy there, and I was again -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, the embassy to the Belgians. I was one of the three economic
                    officers, and I did pretty much the same things that I did in Yugoslavia and got
                    into energy a little bit more, did science work. I did science, labor,
                    economic-commercial stuff. That was the time when the commercial service was
                    split off from the economic part of the house, and we resented that because we
                    thought that we'd provided very good service to American businessmen. Everywhere
                    I'd been we had. And I remember somebody from the Commerce Department coming in
                    looking at my office and at one point saying to me, “Well, this is going to be a
                    nice office. I'll really enjoy working here.” And as it turned out they didn't
                    have the guns, couldn't do it. They got a huge number of posts, including most
                    of the ones with a lot of largely commercial posts in Africa, Latin America,
                    Asia, and they couldn't staff them. And they finally gave them back to the State
                    Department, minus, of course, the positions. And the State Department had to
                    staff those places from static resources. The Commerce Department kept the
                    places in Europe, nice posts, but they were still, in our view, very weak on the
                    basics, and they could not give really good advice to businessmen because they
                    weren't experienced enough, didn't know enough about the countries they were in,
                    both developed or undeveloped. Now I can tell you a story later about that when
                    we get to Australia.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find Belgium at this particular time? It's always been sort of in
                    the heartland of the economic world and all, but what was your impression
                    there?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Impression of Belgium? It was very highly developed, was crippled by
                    the linguistic divisions and also was a very high-cost place, and at that time -
                    '77-'80, '81 - it was very, very expensive to live there on a dollar salary. The
                    exchange rate was low the entire time. It struck me the more you got into the
                    Belgian economy, the more you realized it was just an adjunct of the German
                    economy. It was the supplier of one thing or another to the German economy, and
                    it was tied to kind of an informal Deutschmark grouping within the European
                    Community. And the Germans pretty much dictated the level of interest rates. If
                    they raised interests rates, everybody else was obliged to do so. But it was a
                    very comfortable society. People were very capable and highly developed.
                    Terrific infrastructure, roads, railroads, telephone system - the whole thing
                    worked much better, as I recall, in terms of infrastructure, than France in the
                    '60s. It was a pleasant place to be, very easy to live there - great food, very
                    friendly people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Flemish-Walloon division inhibited
                        theconomics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Of the country?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes. It made for a great deal of inefficiency because they really
                    did have two of everything - at least two of everything. They would have two
                    postal services sometimes, in areas like Brussels, which had a mixture of
                    Walloons and Flamands. They'd have two different postal systems working the same
                    street. They had, in Brussels anyway, which was one of the truly bilingual
                    places of Belgium, and most of the shopkeepers and a lot of the people who
                    worked there were Flemish but spoke really good French and were happy to speak
                    French with you as an American. When you got out into the Flemish part of the
                    country, people wouldn't speak French with you. Sometimes when you're overseas
                    and you have a foreign language, that's the foreign language that comes out
                    first wherever you are. But if you came out with French in Flanders, people
                    would stare at you. They knew it perfectly well, but they didn't want to speak
                    it. But then you'd speak English, and they were really good at English. That was
                    another thing that was extraordinary in that country, that virtually everyone
                    spoke English, and good English, and in higher levels of their army and
                    bureaucracy they all spoke English, and in some cases in the army, rather than
                    speak either French or Dutch, higher commanders would speak English to one
                    another and write memos in English to one another. And so it was really a thing.
                    It seemed to be a country that was at least coping with this problem. But it
                    also had some other serious problems. They had a lot of dying industry down in
                    the Walloon part. I followed the steel industry very closely with a lot of
                    interest in the steel trade back in the States. And that was really a rust belt
                    industry and way overmanned, underinvested, and just a pure loser. And they had
                    a lot of restructuring to do, but it really was a highly developed country.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you sort of carrying on a watching brief? I know in so many of my
                    interviews when we get into Africa we get the Union Mini�re, and that and its
                    influence in the Congo/Zaire. Was that at all a factor by this time?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes. I was the guy in the embassy who was charged with that, and
                    I had a lot of contacts at the Union Mini�re, people that I got to like, saw
                    fairly frequently, and these were the people that had a lock on the cobalt
                    supply, and the cobalt was necessary to make jet engine rotors, and there
                    apparently was no real substitute for it. Cobalt was very expensive, and these
                    guys kept a monopoly on the production with their Zairois friends or colleagues
                    or co-conspirators or whatever you want to call them, and they kept the price
                    high, and a lot of people made a lot of money off that, and a lot of it was sort
                    of misspent down in Africa. But we kept very close tabs on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to do anything to loosen them up on that,
                        or wletting that sort of monopoly work its way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I think we sort of faced the facts. It was a monopoly. It would
                    be hard to break it up - break it up into what? The Zairois company was called
                    Gecamines. Gecamines was controlled by Union Mini�re and it worked in Katanga,
                    the old breakaway part of the Congo. I don't know that we could see any
                    alternative at the time to the UnioMini�re, and what finally broke the monopoly,
                    in effect, was that they kept the price too high, and so people started to
                    search for substitutes for cobalt and they found some to make jet engine rotors
                    for commercial jets, that didn't have to be made out of cobalt. The still needed
                    the cobalt for fighter jets, much higher temperature rotors, I guess. We've
                    never had a really conscious policy, as I remember, of trying to dismantle this
                    monopoly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Anne Cox Chambers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find her and her interest in the economic
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: She didn't have all that much interest in the economic side of it.
                    She was a Carter appointee who had been very influential on getting Carter known
                    nationally and financed him very substantially in his election campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a publisher in Georgia, was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, the Atlanta Constitution and the big investment is Cox
                    Enterprises - cable TV systems, worth billions of dollars. And she and her
                    sister owned the thing - they're both billionaires, and unlike a lot of people
                    with that kind of money, she's very generous, so that the staff would get the
                    benefit wherever it could. We had representational funds the ambassador never
                    used. The embassy's representational funds would have disappeared in a New York
                    minute the way she spent money, but she left it all to the troops, so I had a
                    very large representation account, so I was able to entertain a lot of people -
                    and always got repaid for it. She was very generous. She really liked being a
                    part of the activity, seeing and meeting famous people, participating in
                    meetings with the President and that sort of thing. And she was very jealous of
                    her ambassadorial prerogatives, too. She had problems in keeping DCMs. We had
                    three DCMs in the four years I was there. A couple of them were canned for
                    getting too far into what she considered her zone, her prerogatives. But she was
                    a good person. As I say, she was generous.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize we had an embassy there dealing with what I
                        guess wathe European Union at the time, or was it the European
                        Commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: The European Commission.</p>
                <p>Q: The European Commission, but it went through several manifestations. But what
                    was your impression of the Belgian connection to the European Union?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, the European Union was very important for them and it gave them
                    more of a voice in European affairs than they would have on their own, the size
                    of the country and so on. They derived a lot of benefit from having it located
                    in Brussels. A lot of money was spent by the European Commission in Belgium, in
                    terms of salaries and building buildings to house these guys. They got far more
                    out of it, I think, over all, than they were able to put into it. They were
                    happy to have the European Commission there, although they complained about all
                    the allowances and perks that people who worked for the Commission got - no
                    taxes, breaks on cars, very substantial living allowances.</p>
                <p>Q: I must say that looking at this whole European thing, they live quite well,
                    don't they, these European representatives. What was your impression of the role
                    of controls, bureaucracy, on the economy? I have the gut feeling that by the
                    time the Europeans are through they'll strangle themselves by over-controls,
                    particularly coming from the German and the French side, but how about
                    Belgium?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, they had a lot of control, but the Belgians were used to this,
                    and they were pretty good at evading needless restrictions. The whole country,
                    where it could, it ran on a cash economy so people wouldn't report a lot of
                    income. As a matter of fact, on their national accounts, they could never
                    balance the national accounts because they always had a tremendous imbalance
                    between what was produced and then what was reported as paid for. Any kind of
                    personal service - you know, you get your car fixed, furniture repaired - people
                    would always quote you a price in cash and a price if you wanted to pay by
                    check. And so it always made sense to pay cash, and so they evaded it that way.
                    There really was a lot of tax evasion.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the political parties play much of a role in the economy, or even the
                    royal family, or was this pretty much a business-run economy - business people
                    running the economy?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, parties had major roles in business. Any kind of public contract
                    was pretty much determined by the parties, and just before we left - I thought
                    it was '81 - when they had big contracts. We sold them the F-16. We were in
                    competition with the French, who wanted to sell them the Mirage, but we won it,
                    and we think we won it fair and square, although I'm not so sure any more. I
                    think there was a lot of money passed. We sold it. I was involved in doing some
                    of the offset work. The Belgians and the Dutch all wanted to buy the plane, but
                    they wanted to have the costs of these things offset by work that would be given
                    them by General Dynamics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is General Dynamics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: General Dynamics, the maker of the F-16's. And so the embassy worked
                    very closely with General Dynamics, so we won that contract, and we won it
                    basically because General Dynamics realized that the people who ran the Belgian
                    Air Force were all fighter pilots, and the F-16 was an incredibly quick
                    airplane. And so what they did was they'd arrange things, they'd have all these
                    guys out to the airport, and they'd have an F-16 on one runway and an F-4, which
                    at that time was the first-run aircraft, and they'd have them both take off at
                    the same time, and the F-16 would take off so much faster, and then it would
                    loop, while the F-4 would take off. And the F-16 would already be on its tail.
                    And the F-16 was so highly powered that if you revved the engine up on the
                    ground you had to tie the wings down. So these guys loved this. This was just
                    like riding a rocket as far as they were concerned, so that's what they had to
                    have. So they persuaded the government that they had to have it. But there was a
                    tremendous scandal with the helicopter contract, where the Italians sold them
                    Bell Agusta choppers. And there was a tremendous amount of bribes paid for that.
                    And somebody who was involved in it was a socialist politician, a Walloon
                    politician involved in this, and he got murdered, and they never found out who
                    did it. And a socialist who became the Secretary General of NATO, Willy Claes, a
                    very capable guy, was forced to resign from fall-out years later from this
                    helicopter scandal. But any big contract, anything that went out to bid, would
                    quite probably have a kind of pot-de-vin attached to it, a kind of bribe. It was
                    a very small country and very rich. It had a lot of public expenditure. And as
                    we've seen since, it's a very carelessly run place. People escape from jail.
                    Some very strange things go on in Belgium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a large �migr� group, say from the Congo or from
                        Rwandor the Belgian colonies, and did they play much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, not much of one. They had a lot of guest-workers, Gastarbeiter,
                    from all over, but they had a lot of North Africans, Zairois, Rwandans, but they
                    didn't play that big a role in the economy, it seemed to me. They weren't that
                    visible in the economy, and they were mainly factory workers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the unions? You think of France and the unions
                        arinto everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, well, there are very strong unions in Belgium, too. They're tied
                    to the political parties. They have French-speaking unions and Flemish-speaking
                    unions. You get the impression, as I recall, that the unions were stronger in
                    the Walloon part of the country because that was the declining region. The
                    declining region is where the jobs were being lost, and they had some really
                    derelict towns, towns which were one-industry steel mill towns, and they were
                    really looking pretty bad by 1980-81.</p>
                <p>Q: You've been following this at this time. Why was it that the big steel
                    complexes in the United States and Western Europe and all were going downhill at
                    this time? Was the demand for steel going down, or was it being picked up
                    somewhere else? I mean, what was causing this?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, partially it was technological and partially it was wage costs.
                    And the wage costs were too high in the Western countries and the United States.
                    And then the U.S. steel industry just didn't keep up with the technology of
                    steel-making, and people like the Japanese and the Koreans did, and so they were
                    able to undercut, sell steel at a much lower price, and so that's what caused
                    it. But basically it was technological, because now, the United States is among
                    the most competitive producers of steel in the world, beating out the Japanese
                    and Koreans because we dismantled the whole old steel industry, closed it all
                    down, and now we've got steel mills that use the technology, the oxygen furnace,
                    which uses scrap iron and produces steel much, much cheaper than the old
                    furnaces. And all sorts of technology. I don't know that much about the -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a lot fewer people, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Lots fewer people, and they're non-unionized. And they're just
                    leaner, and they're more fixed on producing steel that their customers want and
                    when they want it.</p>
                <p>Q: I was consul general in Naples around this time, and there were a couple of
                    steel mills outside of Naples, one in Taranto, and the problem was that the
                    government couldn't shut them down because in those days they employed a hell of
                    a lot of people, and so they were running them at a loss because they couldn't
                    afford to throw 5,000 people out of work.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it was a big problem back here, but they finally, in the '80s,
                    shut down those big West Virginia and Pennsylvania mills, and really, we had the
                    most competitive steel mills in the world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes. So you could see all of these steel mills declining in Belgium
                    for basically the same reasons. They were heavily unionized, high-cost, and
                    high-cost raw materials and outdated technology - poor management too. The steel
                    mills didn't benefit, basically, from very advanced management. They really were
                    not in the vanguard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the port of Antwerp? That must have been a
                        majoengine in the Belgian economy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, it sure was, no doubt about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you watching this and how things were going
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: We had a consulate general up there, so they would keep track of it.
                    Pretty much everything on northern Europe either comes through Antwerp or
                    Rotterdam, and both are gigantic ports. Both are very efficient ports, and
                    they've got this tremendous infrastructure of roads and railroads that tie into
                    them, and airports. But the whole thing is really integrated and really
                    works.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we watching that and picking up... I mean, were we looking at, say, a
                    complex like this and passing on ideas, saying, Gee, this would work - why don't
                    we do this in the States? Or do we just let industry pick this up for
                    themselves?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Where we would come across something that we thought was interesting
                    and could be used in the United States, since I was the science officer there
                    and was later science officer in Australia, you would see sometimes I really got
                    to like the idea of reading obscure journals and going out and seeing things.
                    One of the things I tried to push from Belgium was in situ coal gas, where you'd
                    fire up some coal underground and then draw off the gas and use the gas, draw
                    off this natural gas. And I used to write airgrams and send the documents about
                    this process back to the Department of Energy, and I finally got them so upset
                    that they wrote me and said, “Stop sending us this stuff. This wouldn't work in
                    the States. The coal seams are different.” But that sort of thing. Where we
                    would find an innovation and report it back to the government, but then the
                    government doesn't do very much with information like that back here. In
                    Australia I remember finding somebody who had invented a natural replacement for
                    red dye number two, the food color. Instead of costing $1500 a pound, which is
                    what it costs to make it artificially, it cost $50 dollars a pound. So I wrote
                    that up and sent it back. But once it goes back to the government, it goes back
                    to the Department of Commerce, what do they do with it? You know, that's one of
                    the poorest outfits in the U.S. government. I'm not sure they can get out of
                    their own way, those people.</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, I tell you, it worked all the way down through thranks of

                <p>WEINGARTEN: '84. When I left, Washington in '77, I used to tell the story that I
                    swore on the heads of my wife and kids that I wouldn't come back to Washington
                    again, and so we went straight from Brussels to Australia and came back on home

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No they all were in school in Brussels, at the American School there,
                    which became my project. We got there and the school was terrible, the American
                    school. It was a military school - a military school in the sense that it was an
                    overseas school and had a lot of military kids in it, small school, but it was
                    really badly run. So after a year or so I got on the school board and later
                    became the president of the PTA, and we tried to get the State Department to
                    pull the State Department kids out of it. It was drug-ridden; it was very badly
                    run. And we got two of the ambassadors, Ambassador Chambers and Dean Hinton, who
                    was the ambassador to the European Commission, supported the effort to get the
                    State Department kids out of the school and get them an allowance that would
                    enable them to go to one of the other two schools, the Brussels American School
                    in Brussels and St. John's. Both were good schools, but the NATO ambassador
                    didn't want to do that because he thought that the military kids would then have
                    to go to a boarding school in Frankfurt and he wouldn't get topnotch officers to
                    work at NATO. So we finally wrote a memo or a telegram that was made into a memo
                    and presented to Ben Reed, who was the secretary of the Department or
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was the head of administration, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: And it had the three alternatives, and as you always do, he was
                    supposed to pick the middle one. That's the way it was written, like a Confucian
                    essay. You're supposed to pick the middle one. He didn't pick the middle one; he
                    picked one of the extremes. The extreme he picked was to give the military
                    another chance, and so the military pumped all kinds of resources into the
                    school, new people, new money, and so on, because we had a four-star general who
                    was a kind of ally of mine, Bill Knowltan, who was at NATO, and four-star
                    generals have amazing clout. So on a back-channel basis, he got all sorts of
                    people in the Pentagon interested in this, and so he really transformed the
                    school. And so the first year they did that it did have a major impact on it.
                    They fired the principal, fired some dud teachers - you know, fired in the sense
                    that they just moved them somewhere else within the Overseas School system. But
                    the school turned around. They got a really tough principal who reinstilled
                    discipline in it in a very tough, no-nonsense kind of way. So the school still
                    wasn't any kind of an intellectual... didn't really nurture kids in that
                    respect, but at least we got rid of the drugs, we got a policy in force that
                    people who had kids using drugs were themselves sent back to the States or the
                    kids were sent back. I can tell you, the culture of the school - I had all three
                    of my kids in it - and I couldn't afford to send them elsewhere - that's what
                    really annoyed me. I didn't make enough money to pay the tuition, and you didn't
                    get any support from the government if you did. And it really annoyed me because
                    these other schools were much better. And so anyway we stuck it out with the
                    school, and I was on the school board and was the president of the PTA in my
                    final year. We did the best we could with it. Anyway, that's the one project I
                    got into over there that I was really kind of wound up in, that I was really
                    into in a big way.</p>

                        were ourelations with Australia during this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, they were terrific, really. We had very good relations with them.
                    Initially, Malcolm Fraser was a Conservative prime minister, and after he was
                    defeated in '83 by Hawke, Labor. But we had good relations with both
                    governments. Back in the '70s, Australia had really been a sort of Foreign
                    Service resort, and when they had a change of administration, they had a Labor
                    prime minister and nobody in the embassy knew anybody on that side of the policy
                    divide, and so the embassy was out of it for a long time, and so we determined
                    that would not happen to us again. They sent Marshall Green out there as
                    ambassador, and we got relations reset, and then after that, since then for the
                    most part we've sent political appointees to it. The ambassador at the time I
                    was there was a very nice man, a Cadillac dealer from Thousand Oaks, California,
                    who was a friend of Reagan's. So we had a very good DCM, whose name was Steve
                    Lyne. And of all the embassies we've been in, the embassy was one where
                    everybody got along well, everybody worked together, and- (end of tape)</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, I wasn't. I was just the number two guy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I mean to do economics, because economics aren't a

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, we did. At the time the Australian economy was very much state-
                    controlled in a lot of ways, so we had a lot of activities - trade and financial
                    issues - with the government in Canberra, but we used to travel quite a bit to
                    Sydney and Melbourne, and the commercial attach� there had got himself
                    transferred from Canberra to Sydney, but he didn't have the first clue what he
                    was doing, so I wound up taking that over, doing mostly commercial work.</p>

                    the other thing, and the other guy doesn't pick it up, you pick it up yourself.
                    And so at one point, I think it was in '83, I went to Tokyo. They had a meeting
                    of Commerce reps in Tokyo, and they wanted all the commercial attach�s, so the
                    ambassador said, “Well, you should go; you're doing it.” I went it, and I went
                    to the meeting, and they said, “You shouldn't be here. You don't work for the
                    Commerce Department. You work for the State Department. In fact, you're our
                    enemy. We don't want you here.” And so, well, I said, “That's fine.” So I went
                    off and had a three-day holiday in Tokyo. I just went around Tokyo. And these
                    guys didn't want to have anything to do with me, didn't want to talk about
                    commercial work while I was there, assuming I was a spy. That's great. I'll take
                    three days off. And then they fired this guy finally, the Commerce
                    Department.</p>
                <p>We just took care of all of the stuff for him and kept his files, kept his
                    accounts, and he was a nice guy. He liked it. We got along with each other fine,
                    but he just didn't know the first thing about operating in the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main economic concerns in Australia from our

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, trade restrictions that we had, that we would threaten to impose
                    on the Australians. What else? It was not all that much, I guess. We did a lot
                    of reporting from Australia that I suspect nobody really paid much attention to
                    in Washington, but we kept ourselves busy. But basically trade restrictions,
                    ours and theirs, were the major -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the trade restrictions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, we would sometimes have trade restrictions on things like
                    imports into the United States of Australian lamb. We would annoy the hell out
                    of the Australians by subsidizing our exports of wheat to third countries where
                    they were major exporters - that sort of thing. We would object to the tariff
                    structure that they had in Australia, which kept foreign products out. They had
                    a very high protective tariff on a lot of things that we wanted to sell into
                    Australia, and one of them was automobiles. They had a high enough tariff rate -
                    100 percent on luxury cars - so as soon as you get there people would say,
                    “Would you like to buy a BMW?” And you'd buy a BMW for about a third of what it
                    cost an Australian, and then you drove it for a couple of years and then you
                    could sell it back to the dealer or on the market for about twice what you paid
                    for it. So that was just kind of anomaly of what happens when you have very high
                    tariffs. People do this kind of thing. Once you said you'd sold your BMW or
                    Mercedes back into the system, the Australian who bought it didn't have to pay
                    there tariff on it, so he got it for a lot less than he'd have to pay for it
                    new.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine unions were quite powerful there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, they really were. They were extremely powerful. We had a labor
                    attach� who took care of them. Of course, they were Labor supporters. They were
                    very fragmented. They had a lot of small unions. We calculated once there were
                    36 unions between the coal mines and the ports and loading it onto a ship, and
                    36 different unions that could go out on strike and cut off the supply, and
                    often did. There were a lot of strikes. A very politicized labor movement.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that the unions were taking sort of an anti-American view. I'm
                    thinking were they picking up almost a classic leftist view shown in the British
                    unions and some Canadian unions?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, in some respects they did. But I don't know, the Australians are
                    so friendly and so outgoing, they never seemed to have a grudge against
                    Americans personally. They had a big problem with... we had a number of bases in
                    Australia, one at Alice Springs, another up on the upper northwest part of
                    Australia that tracked Soviet submarines and things like that. They were very
                    secret, and the Australians and the New Zealanders at that time were very
                    worried that these kinds of bases were very excellent targets for the Soviets in
                    case there was a war, so they were very resentful of these bases. And I recall
                    in '83 that the White House wanted to send President Reagan out to do a trip
                    through Australia, and the idea was to get a lot of campaign footage that would
                    show a lot of smiling little white kids waving flags and so on for the campaign
                    coming up in '84. And we had to tell him that if you send him out here to make a
                    speech or to do that sort of thing, it would provoke full-scale riots. They had
                    been in Vietnam, and Johnson had twisted their arms. They sent troops to
                    Vietnam, and they felt they'd really been euchred by us on that, and so they
                    were very suspicious of us and what they regarded as our bellicose attitude. Now
                    they didn't send Reagan out; Bush came out. Bush did a -</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: He was Vice President then. He came out and did the Coral Sea
                    celebration. Every year they celebrated the Coral Sea Battle, which was the
                    battle that kept the Japanese from invading Australia and was one of the
                    setbacks to the Japanese in '42, one of the few setbacks they had. And so that
                    was always kind of the touchstone of U.S.-Australian relations because the
                    Australians were unable to defend themselves at the time because their troops
                    were all fighting for the British in North Africa.</p>

                    mines. They were very competitive, but they were hampered by labor unions. They
                    could produce coal as cheaply as anyone else in the world, but by the time they
                    managed to run the gauntlet of all these unions and get it on the water, it was
                    no cheaper than American coal or South African coal. So there were a few
                    industries that were world class, and everything was... They had some automobile
                    firms that were established there behind this very high protective law. General
                    Motors had a couple of plants there. Ford had some plants there. They produced
                    cars that really looked like the previous generation of U.S. cars. They weren't
                    modern at all. If they'd permitted tariff-free imports of automobiles, these
                    companies would have gone out of business. Agricultural products, of course,
                    they were world class, too. World-class wines, wheat, and so forth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the commodities tariff subsidy
                        problems,both American and Australian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: How did we deal with them? Well, we just tried to damp down the
                    outcry, I guess. We had restrictions put out from Washington. We didn't have
                    much input into that decision. And then as far as... the structural problems
                    that the economy had through this high tariff law, we could never persuade the
                    Australians to bring that down. I don't think the embassy had much impact either
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then after this, '84, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, after that I went from there to Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aha. So you were in Canada from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: '84-87, and I was the energy officer in Ottawa, and I hit that at a
                    very lucky time, because that was when the Canadians decided to deregulate their
                    energy industry, and they export a lot of oil and gas and electricity to the
                    United States. It's a major trade sector, ran about $10 billion a year. And so
                    we had a specifically designated energy officer up there, so I loved that job -
                    terrific job. And I got to go out to Calgary, where the energy industry was
                    located, got to know all the oil company people, helped the government, which
                    was very friendly. It was the Mulroney government. It was very friendly to the
                    United States. We helped them deregulate, dismantle their very complicated
                    regulations that they had that prevented the U.S. investment, and so we played a
                    major role.</p>
                <p>Q: It had been a policy, I guess initially under Trudeau, hadn't it, to try to do
                    something about our energy for us and not... had that been gradually changing
                    over the years?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it changed. Part of this is some of the research I'm doing now
                    for this project I'm on, but in the early '70s, in '71, we put restrictions on
                    Canadian imports of oil because they were swamping our import control system.
                    Two years later the Canadians put on export controls to keep the oil from coming
                    down to the United States and causing them shortages. But then later in the '70s
                    and '80s, the Canadians had some major energy projects, and it's a small country
                    so they don't have the investment pool to draw from, so they needed U.S.
                    investment, but they were very reluctant to have U.S. companies come in and take
                    control of things. And then the Mulroney government in 1984 came in, and they
                    changed the policy 180 degrees, and they welcomed investment, and they
                    dismantled the regulations that kept U.S. investors from... They did this
                    progressively, over the three years I was there. And so trade boomed; big
                    projects got underway; offshore projects, arctic projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about water projects from Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: For the electricity?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Those were big projects. We always had problems with that because it
                    was a question of reliability, but in the other sense of reliability, not the
                    sense that they couldn't supply it. But they had these gigantic, very high
                    tension electric power lines that spanned all the way from James Bay, up in
                    northern Quebec, down to New York, but if any kind of lightning struck one of
                    these things, it would make the whole East Coast system of the United States
                    wobble because it made such a major contribution. And normally, in the United
                    States there are so many interconnections and doubling that if one main line is
                    put out the system can adjust very quickly to compensate, but not in when that
                    big Canadian line goes out. And as I recall, that's what happened in '79 when we
                    had that big blackout in New York. That was where it originated, up in
                    Canada.</p>
                <p>The Canadians did not like the idea that they were hewers of wood and drawers of
                    water, just selling raw materials to the United States, and so there was a
                    terrific degree of sensitivity to that in Canada, which made the job interesting
                    and made the... It was really one of the few countries I've been in where the
                    embassy really made a difference. We could really get into serious problems if
                    you didn't understand what was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: How would this work, for example? You said you were helping another country
                    deregulate or take away its own regulations. How did that work out?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: You'd just say, “Hey, that's great, atta boy [good job].” Take them
                    down and show them how things worked in the States. Basically, we just
                    encouraged them to do this. It's sort of like pushing on an open door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking and saying, “This is causing problems;
                        that'causing problems”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes. And we'd tell them that this is slowing investor interest in the
                    states and this doesn't work and you ought to consider getting rid of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The impetus was that the prime minister said, “It shall be
                        done”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, and so then we'd track it and make sure it was donan identify if
                    there were a roadblock to it, try to identify that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Canadian bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It depended. The Ministry of Finance was very good. The Department of
                    Energy and Resources was good. The Foreign Minister was probably the one most
                    sensitive to slights. The people in the Foreign Office could be rubbed the wrong
                    way very quickly. There was always a kind of envy and distaste, maybe equally
                    balanced. They don't like a lot of what they saw going on in the States, but
                    they can't help but be fascinated by it. Also, Canada's not a very competitive
                    sort of place, and it has a host of restrictions on cultural things and so on.
                    And they have restrictions on Americans buying property up there. They want to
                    keep Canada for the Canadians, but on the other hand, they also have expressions
                    like, “If you're so good, how come you're still in Saskatoon?” So Canadians that
                    want to make it, there's the U.S. to go try your hand at, New York or LA, San
                    Francisco or Chicago. So there's just a host of difference between Americans...
                    Canadians are very keen on being different from Americans, and there are
                    differences that most Americans wouldn't notice, wouldn't consider to be real
                    differences. But it's a terrific country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Quebec power grid. Was there anything
                        thacould be done about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: No, not really. On the receiving end you just had to be very careful
                    and try to have enough power elsewhere to compensate for sudden loss of it
                    coming down. And so they'd have to make those kinds of preparations back in New
                    York State, basically. And then selling all this power to New York, which needed
                    it, but then they got involved in... Environmentalists in Canada objected to
                    these gigantic projects for environmental reasons and also because of the impact
                    that they had on the indigenous Indian people up there. They'd flood huge parts
                    of western Quebec to build these dams. It was country that people figured was
                    really not productive in any way. But they didn't really consult very closely
                    with the Indians, and so they had some real problems. And New York finally
                    decided against importing a lot more extra power from Quebec, in part because of
                    the reliability issue, and in part because of the environmental issue and also
                    in part because they figured they could promote conservation and coax people to
                    use energy more efficiently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the oil? I would assume that oil producers in
                        Canadwould be delighted to sell their oil wherever it would go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Sure, and there were always tensions between the people in western
                    Canada who produced the oil and people in eastern Canada who ran the government.
                    And it was even more acute than that. They had the same kind of problem in the
                    States, Washington and some of the outlying areas, when we were doing a
                    free-trade agreement, the forerunner to NAFTA. We discovered that the Bonneville
                    Power Administration in Washington State, which is an autonomous outfit but
                    comes under the Secretary of Energy, and they didn't like what the federal
                    government was doing with the Free Trade Agreement, and so they were able to
                    have an effective veto over it. And they made that stick. You know, here's an
                    autonomous federal government agency, and they made their view successfully
                    known through the Congressional delegations from those four states out there,
                    from Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and Montana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: They were concerned that we were going to give the Canadians an
                    opportunity to get into the California electric power market by forcing
                    Bonneville Power to let the Canadian power come in over its lines to California.
                    It would have made sense for the consumers in California. They would have got
                    cheaper energy, but we couldn't get that through. Bonneville refused to go along
                    with it. But that was a much more acute relationship or controversy between the
                    federal government in Canada and the provinces, which have a great deal more
                    independence in most respects than the states do vis-�-vis the federal
                    government.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this a matter of nationalism with the central government, or was it a
                    matter of things being diverted from going to Ontario and going south? Did sort
                    of the petroleum grid and electric grid go east and west, or was it pretty much
                    designed just to go north- south?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It pretty much goes south, north and south, and the two economies are
                    complementary in the sense that you have your big surge in electric power use in
                    the States during the summer when it's much cooler up in Canada, so they had
                    spare power; and then vice versa in the winter time. And so the oil pipeline
                    grid doesn't extend in to eastern Canada. It doesn't go to Quebec, and it
                    doesn't extent to the populated part of Ontario. It heads south, and so the
                    Canadians find it more economical to sell it to us. Of course they could build a
                    pipeline across the whole country, but it wouldn't be economical. It wouldn't be
                    competitive with oil that came in from pipelines that begin in Maine, for
                    example, and go up to Quebec. And so they have a line, the Ottawa Valley Line,
                    and pretty much east of that is where there are 100 percent imports. The oil,
                    and especially now natural gas, in Canada is very competitive, very sought after
                    on the West Coast and Midwest markets and also in the East. It complements the
                    gas that's brought up from Louisiana and Texas and Oklahoma. And we have a
                    system that is so big, so enormous, of pipelines that they can connect into at
                    various places. They make a lot of money on it, and they negotiate very tough
                    contracts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Sometimes. Once in 1987, there was a $5 billion deal where Amoco in
                    Chicago was going to buy a big Canadian company called Dome, and the chairman of
                    Dome, who was never accessible, came to Ottawa and saw the finance minister in
                    the morning to tell him that he was going to sell to Amoco, told the foreign
                    minister in the afternoon, and had lunch with me in the interim and told me
                    about it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, and it also was to look into the federal anprovincial
                    regulations and see where there were obstacles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find it was the federal regulations that

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, much more so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, and it's a much more consensual form of relationship between the
                    provinces and the federal government than it is in the States. The federal
                    government had constitutional crises with the oil-producing province of Alberta
                    in the late '70s, and part of it was the same sort of thing that you get here.
                    The people in the west say, “These goddam people in the East, these people in
                    suits in Washington who don't know what they're doing are screwing up our
                    business.” It was very acute up there.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Not really. It was an advantage to speak French there, but you didn't
                    really need it, because there were very few energy - apart from the electric
                    power people in Quebec - very few people that you would find to speak French to
                    in business terms. And the French up there is a French that's got a lot of...
                    it's sort of the French of Brittany of 300 years ago. It hasn't evolved to the
                    extent that modern French has, and so it's really a dialect. And my wife, who
                    speaks really good French, lived for 24 years in France, always spoke French in
                    the market... In Ottawa they all come from across the river in Quebec and sell
                    goods, sell their fruit and veggies and meat and so on. And she always figured
                    if she spoke French to them, they would have a higher regard for you, give you a
                    better cut of meat. So she'd speak French to these guys, and they'd all respond
                    in English, in very good English. And she'd insist. She'd speak to them in
                    French. And finally, they would speak back to her in French, but it wasn't the
                    French they were used to speaking. This was fran�ais de France -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: School French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, school French for them. It wasn't their dialect, which is really
                    hard to understand. It's called Jouale. You really had to have a sharp ear for
                    that. Of course, you go up to Quebec City or Montreal, and if people took you
                    for Canadian they would really insist that you spoke French, but if you were
                    American, you know, they'd just give you a pass.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Maritime Provinces play any role in what you were
                        tryinto do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Did they what?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, were they of any concern to you on the energy
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes. There were some big projects off Newfoundland and Nova
                    Scotia that we were interested in that were being promoted to provide gas to the
                    northeastern part of the United States or to provide oil. Oil from Canada was
                    always considered a much safer source. At one point in time, we had an actual
                    tariff preference for oil from the Western Hemisphere. It's no longer there, but
                    people are still anxious to see Canadians develop these projects because they
                    are more secure sources of oil than many of the other oil producers you think
                    of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on? Was it a lot of exploration?</hi>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: A lot of exploration and a couple of big projects, both of which have
                    taken place, finally, only recently. They were pretty high cost. They were
                    offshore projects, an offshore gas project and then an offshore oil project off
                    Newfoundland. And so they've both come on stream, and presumably I think they're
                    both making money.</p>

                <p>WEINGARTEN: I came back to Washington and did Washington five yearthis time. The

                <p>WEINGARTEN: Great. Okay.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 26th of August, 1999. 1987 you're back. Where
                        diyou go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, I came back and went to the Bureau of Economic Affairs, and I was
                    the deputy director of the Office of Fuels and Energy. It changed names several
                    times in the interim. Anyway, it was the energy office in the Bureau of Economic
                    Affairs, deputy director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First a little bit about how it was set up. Who was in
                        chargand up the line a bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: The fellow in charge of the energy office was Bill Ramsay, an old
                    friend of mine and somebody I'd served with in Brussels back in the late '70s. I
                    called him from Ottawa and said, “I need a job.” And I said, “I'm not really
                    sure I'm going to get promoted. I'm in the last year of my open window, and if I
                    don't get promoted to the Senior Foreign Service I'm out on my ear.” So I said,
                    “I don't know how much time I can spend with you, but I would like to take a
                    shot at it.” And he said, “Okay, fine, come on down here.” Then it turned out
                    that that year both of us got promoted at the same time to Senior Foreign
                    Service, and it was really kind of a surprise to me. That's a very tough hurdle
                    to get across. But I got across it, and then spent five years in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: What were the issues of your particular interest, I mean your office of fuels
                    and energy? The great crises of the '70s were sort of past, weren't they? What
                    were we looking at?</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, basically, we were tracking what OPEC was doing. We were
                    maintaining good relationships with our major suppliers, the Saudis, the other
                    moderate Arab countries in the Gulf, the Canadians, the Venezuelans. That was
                    basically it. We worked with the Energy Department. We staffed out a lot of
                    international conferences. We did a lot of travel in this office, a lot of it to
                    Paris, as far as the travel money, which was always short, would carry us. And
                    basically we did that. The first couple of years there, you're right, there were
                    not crises, and so the office kind of dwindled. We would lose officers who would
                    be pulled out to work in other places that seemed to be more active, more in the
                    spotlight, and so I worked a couple of years at that, really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>Q: While we're still on this particular period, how did we see OPEC at this, say,
                    '87 to '90 or whatever, while we were going through this preliminary period, and
                    how did we deal with it at that point?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: We didn't deal with OPEC itself so much as we dealt with the
                    individual countries that made up OPEC. We had very poor relations, as you can
                    imagine, with both Iran and Iraq and Libya, three major members of it. We didn't
                    go to OPEC conferences. We had as a tenet of our policy that we would not
                    consent to any kind of overall producer-consumer dialogue because it would be
                    seen in the outside world - in the energy world, anyway - as the producers and
                    consumers conspiring to fix price levels that the market wouldn't have fixed. So
                    we stayed away from OPEC as such, and we dealt with the moderates. We traveled;
                    we tried to keep the Saudis happy. They were anxious to have annual
                    consultations with us. Kuwaitis, all of these more moderate countries.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm thinking of the Italians, the French, and the Germans at this time - were
                    any of them playing a different game? The Japanese, were they playing different
                    games than we were?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, well, somewhat, but not one that made a very big difference as
                    far as we were concerned. I think the French had better relations, say, with the
                    Iraqis than we did. The Italians still had some relationship with the Libyans.
                    The Europeans in general wanted to renew a dialogue with the Iranians well
                    before we did. We worked out most of that at the OECD in Paris - actually at the
                    International Energy Agency in Paris. So it wasn't a major bone of contention,
                    as I recall, between us and the Europeans. It was just something - you know, we
                    had different emphases, some cases where traditional friendships or traditional
                    links were maintained even on an attenuated basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Venezuela and Nigeria? These are two other big
                        oiproducers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, Nigeria - we actually didn't have a great deal of relationship
                    with Nigeria. Nigeria was always a place with a tremendous amount of low-level
                    turmoil, and it was very difficult to... I never traveled to Lagos. Venezuela
                    was just the sort of country that was so linked to the U.S. market. 90 percent
                    of its economy is based on oil, 90 percent of its government receipts come from
                    oil, and the U.S. is basically the only market, because the transportation
                    addition to the oil price makes it uneconomic for them to ship oil to Europe
                    most of the time. We also nurtured a better growing relationship with Mexico,
                    which became a major producer over this period of time, and of course, the U.S.
                    market was a natural for them. So it was really a case of managing various
                    relationships to ensure that we got continued uninterrupted supply of oil and
                    gas.</p>
                <p>Q: This was a time of great prosperity, comparative, in Mexico, wasn't it? They'd
                    gone thorough sort of a boom-bust. Weren't they in a boom at that point, or how
                    were they?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, they had had a major oil industry back in the '30s. They'd
                    nationalized it and it had declined substantially in the '40s and '50s, '60s.
                    And they found still more oil, and they began to develop that in a big way in
                    the '70s, and in the '80s were major suppliers to the U.S. Their oil company was
                    kind of a textbook example of a corrupt and inefficient state organization - way
                    overstaffed, not particularly good at either exploring or developing the oil
                    that it did find - and kind of a textbook example of a place where it really
                    needed a good infusion of U.S. expertise. The U.S. international oil companies
                    have just no equal. They are innovative, they're way ahead on the technical side
                    of it over all the other ones, Europeans as well, and if you want to find oil
                    and you want to develop it inexpensively, those are the guys you have to go
                    through. But the Mexicans have it embedded in their constitution that oil is a
                    national treasure of some sort that cannot have any kind of foreign ownership of
                    it.</p>
                <p>Even at that time, there were still a lot of countries developing offshore oil,
                    for example, which had been found in the '70s, when prices were high, and
                    sometimes the process would take as long as 10 years to come to fruition. And so
                    they were finally coming on stream, and that was helping to keep the price very
                    reasonable in the late '80s. As I said, I did a couple of years of that. It was
                    very interesting, a lot of fun. And I did do a lot of traveling.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find when you were working, was there a sort of a band of fuels and
                    energy people that you would be dealing with all the time from other ministries
                    and other countries and all?</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, pretty much so. And within the U.S. government as well. There
                    was a cadre of people who followed energy and were interested in it, at the
                    Department of Energy, the Department of the Treasury. The Agency at the time had
                    an oil and gas branch that had considerable technical expertise and also had a
                    kind of funding that enabled them to buy gigantic computers and produce maps and
                    so on and kind of gee- whiz briefings. They had a book they brought over and
                    opened it up, and it was a kind of automatic computer-driven slide projector.
                    They had stuff like that. Sometimes it was fun to bring them in when we had
                    foreigners in and show them this stuff. They were very impressed.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the State Department and you and your colleagues bringing to these
                    consultations and various things? What were you about?</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: With these other agencies in the government?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, what the Department of State was about, your
                        group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, we were responsible for the international aspect of all energy,
                    energy writ large. And we could pretty much go into any aspect we cared to go
                    into, and we could... Within the State Department, we had the expertise... hat
                    we would have a lot of struggle sometimes with the regional bureaus over policy.
                    And then within the U.S. government, because we had this international focus as
                    opposed to domestic focus that most agencies had, and so we'd have to work out
                    compromises or just in some cases just steamroller people to get an accord. And
                    then only after that did we go out and deal with the foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's always the greatest negotiation - within the
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, once you get through that process, it's almost cinch to go out
                    and talk to your international colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Soviets - they were still the Soviets during this
                        time -were they playing any role? They were a big oil producer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Big oil producers. Yes, they began to play a role because it began to
                    look as though they might be open, towards '89-90, to foreign investment. And
                    they produced a lot of oil, but they produced it very inefficiently and in a
                    very environmentally incorrect manner, and both for the long-term future of
                    their oil fields as well, they drew out so much oil that they would cause
                    flooding. The existing reservoirs would be flooded with water, and by pulling
                    out too much oil now, you lost a large chunk of it for the future. So there were
                    times when we'd look into ways that we could help our companies get involved in
                    one way or another with the Russians. But we always had in mind the idea, we had
                    this inexorable increase in demand for oil products - for heating, automobiles,
                    and so on - and we tried to make sure that the supply would be more than
                    adequate, because we recalled that OPEC's power in the '70s and then again in
                    '79-80 came out in the fact that if there were any problems within an OPEC
                    country, there was no spare capacity elsewhere that could be brought on line to
                    make up for the oil that had just like that disappeared from the picture. So I
                    liked that job. I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine - it was in 1990 - it would have been a
                        cruciatime, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It was, and we were, I remember, my wife and I decided that summer of
                    1990 not to go to Europe on vacation but went to Sea Island, Georgia, instead,
                    and that's when Saddam invaded Kuwait. And I knew that we were going to be
                    working seven-day weeks when we got back, and on the way back - we drove back -
                    and we drove past North Carolina, and you could already see troop movements on
                    the road. The 82nd Airborne was going off. And I was right. When I got back
                    there was a tremendous amount of work. We did work seven days a week. But also,
                    just before I'd gone down to Sea Island, Bill Ramsay, who was the deputy
                    assistant secretary, asked me if I would take over his food policy operation. We
                    had the commodities office and we had energy and we had food. And I was
                    initially reluctant to do it because it had a reputation at the time of just
                    being kind of a place where junior officers who had started out and hadn't done
                    particularly well on their first tour were shunted. And so I said, “Okay, I'd
                    like to do both of these.” And Ramsay said, “No, no, really, that's a very
                    complicated job, and I'm not getting the kind of results I need out of the guy
                    who's got it now.” So I said, “Okay, I'll do it.” I did it, and as it turned
                    out, that was the best job I've ever had.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Food policy. What was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it was made up of several components. It did have a lot of odds
                    and ends to it. My office was responsible for the agricultural component of the
                    NAFTA agreement with the Mexicans and Canadians. We were also the State
                    Department component of the annual government determination of where food aid
                    would go, in conjunction with AID. We also did, for the State Department,
                    commodities such as sugar, coffee, both of which were agreements we belonged to
                    at the time. Another aspect that was negotiating with the European Union and
                    participating in negotiations with the European Union on the agricultural
                    chapter of the trade round. But the thing that took up the most time was a
                    program that we had, that Congress had mandated, whereby we supported U.S.
                    farmers, U.S. companies selling grains and other commodities overseas, basically
                    against European competition. What we were supposed to do was provide what was
                    called an “export enhancement program” - that's basically subsidies. Well,
                    they're kind of complicated subsidies. A company would go out and make a sale,
                    make a commitment, say, to provide China with six million tons of wheat. And the
                    Europeans would also be in that market as well, and the Europeans would offer a
                    subsidized price. We would try to offer a price below theirs to beat them out of
                    the market, and the difference between the world price and the price we were
                    offering in China would be made up by a subsidy. We would pay the U.S. seller a
                    subsidy based on this difference, but the subsidy would come out of the
                    warehouses where we had all this surplus food stored. So eventually we were so
                    successful in that program that we wound up cleaning out all the warehouses and
                    saving the government billions of dollars in storage fees - putting storage
                    companies out of business, though, but there's an ox gored on every issue. But
                    the problem there was getting these things through the government, because all
                    of the regional bureaus were ferociously opposed to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would that be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, partially because most Foreign Service officers come in with
                    drummed into them the notion of free trade and so on, which is right. But these
                    were short-term expedient policies. And they really didn't like them. We had
                    very bad relations with the Australians over grain, with the New Zealanders over
                    dairy products, and the Argentineans on grain. And so the desks didn't like it.
                    And so we would up with a lot of these things, we had to send them up to the
                    undersecretary, who was Bob Zoellick at the time, for determination. And so what
                    I did, I had this corps of 12 junior officers - most of them junior officers -
                    and what I did was teach them how to write papers that would get Zoellick's
                    attention, to write it in a way that after he reads the title he's going to want
                    to read the rest of it, all in bullets and tics. I trained them all in that, and
                    I really worked them very hard, and I said, “You work for me, do this right, and
                    I'll do my best to get you promoted.” I got them all promoted, every last one,
                    including some very... I'm sorry, I missed on one, a kid who just didn't pay
                    attention, a kid who actually died later because he fell into a river up in
                    Central Asia, died of hypothermia. But he was the kind of kid who was careless,
                    the kind of kid who when he was a consular officer he left the consular seal out
                    overnight a couple of times, and they got on his case about that. He just was
                    not cut out for it. But all the others, we got them promoted. I had a corps of
                    hotshots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Desks trying to stab you in the back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes. Desks would try to work around us, and that was back in the
                    days of rather than having dueling memos go up to the Secretary or the
                    undersecretary, we always had what we called split memos - different opinions -
                    and so we used to say, well, we'll put in whatever you want to say, and we did.
                    And I was just appalled at how badly written some of these things were and how
                    illogical they were. We just put their stuff in there and let them kill
                    themselves. But anyway, I really enjoyed doing that, and putting this stuff up
                    to Zoellick, who didn't like the process, but after all, it was Congressionally
                    mandated. We had to do it.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I would have thought that some of the things you mention are terribly
                    political, always have been - sugar, coffee, rice, particularly.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Coffee!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about some of those commodities that you
                        were dealing with, and maybe the Congressional component.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, we had the international agreements on coffee and sugar. We are
                    of course the major consumer of sugar, the major consumer of coffee, and we
                    decided early on that we didn't want to participate in these international
                    commodity organizations any more. They cost us money; they tried to maintain
                    prices higher than the market. So we worked with the USTR, and we got out of the
                    sugar agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: U.S. Trade Representative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: U.S. Trade Representative. Then we went and worked on the coffee
                    agreement, and tried to get the coffee agreement to have more of a market bias
                    to it than it had. And that one we had to work on very seriously because it was
                    the centerpiece of JFK's Alliance for Progress - you know, in Latin America in
                    '62. We couldn't make the coffee agreement work the way we wanted it to work,
                    and so we finally opted out of that as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that mean, by opting out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it means that we said, “Well, we're not going to abide by the
                    rules of the coffee agreement. We'll just buy coffee at the market price - buy
                    it if the price is low, if the price is high, we'll buy it high. We'll let the
                    market set the prices. We're not going to get involved in buffer stocks and so
                    on.” And so none of these countries wanted us to leave, because we are so big,
                    the U.S. market's so enormous that without it a lot of these agreements feel
                    that they have failed. So we said, “Well, go ahead and fail.” You have to
                    remember, this is the late '80s, and as the 1980s or early '90s, those were the
                    years of the market.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reagan-Bush being -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Reagan-Bush, yes. Anything that had a market orientation to it had
                    favor in the Administration. So that's what we did. We had some political
                    things, too. We had a sugar quota. We'd maintain a domestic price for sugar
                    that's far higher than the world price, and this is to favor some major sugar
                    producers in the south and southwest and the west, sugar beet producers and so
                    on. So we maintain a high price, and we do not import sugar, except via a sugar
                    quota, which we distribute among various countries in Latin America and Central
                    America - little countries like Dominica and the Dominican Republic. And for
                    them, the sugar quota is a major thing. And there's a lot of money to be made on
                    it. There are a lot of lobbyists involved in it. So we would have annual
                    meetings about it over at the USDA, at the Department of Agriculture, and the
                    undersecretary would begin the meeting by saying, “Now if this goddam thing
                    leaks one more time” - our decision - he says, “I'm calling in the FBI.” And it
                    always leaked, and it always leaked out of the Department of Agriculture, not
                    out of the State Department. But those were the sort of things we did.</p>
                <p>We did the AID stuff, determining food, PL-480 levels for various countries. And
                    it was a very busy job. As I say, I really enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about rice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, rice is another one of those sorry chapters in our history. We
                    grow a lot of rice, and we grow it very inexpensively, or at least on the
                    surface it seems inexpensive because we don't take into account the water used
                    in growing it, and we sell it and disrupt and displace a lot of foreign rice
                    producers. But the only time we got involved with rice was. After the Iraqis
                    invaded Kuwait, we cut off all our trade with Iraq. Iraq was one of the biggest
                    importers of rice and other commodities on the PL-480 program, and they were not
                    that good a customer. Sometimes they'd be late with their payments and so on,
                    and so a political decision was made, and there was a big hullabaloo after the
                    war broke out, who was responsible for approving the PL-480 shipments to Iraq.
                    And that's still a sensitive issue. But we got involved in it to try to cut off
                    these things, and we had a lot of, for example, a U.S. broker who'd loaded a
                    ship, set to sail for Iraq when the war broke out, with 27,000 tons of rice on
                    it, and we refused to give him a license to export it, and he was really upset,
                    and he said, “You'll put me out of business.” And so he then hired, what was it,
                    Boggs and Blow, the big lobbyist firm, and we'd get people yelling down the
                    phone at us at seven, seven-thirty, eight o'clock at night saying, “You've got
                    to let this stuff go.” We said no, and we had support. Maybe I'm glossing over
                    things in retrospect, but that was the nice thing about that: the Baker-Zoellick
                    State Department would back its people. If you could make an adequate
                    explanation of what you were doing, then they would support you. So anyway, we
                    blocked that rice, and this guy would come back and say, “Well, I'm going to
                    ship my rice to such and such a port.” And we said, “No, you're not.” Because
                    the Iraqis are the only serious rice eaters in the Middle East, we said, “No, we
                    know where that's going, and we're not going to let you ship it.” And finally,
                    it spoiled and he had to sell it at a cut rate.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I would have thought that one of your major things would be the
                    perennial battle, which will continue, much more than the Northern Irish problem
                    of the Catholic thing, and that is between the United States and the European
                    Union over agricultural products. We're talking about two groups with very
                    strong agricultural lobbies where it's more than just money - it's a way of
                    life, it's everything you can think of.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it is, or at least it's sometimes presented that way, but
                    there's very little difference between major commodities like rice and grain and
                    corn and dairy products. For the most part, all of the major producers exported
                    are derived from big farms, big agricultural enterprises, and with few
                    exceptions - the New Zealanders, the Argentineans, and Australia, who have a
                    major advantage in either more fertile land, cheaper labor, or better growing
                    conditions - have the lowest price; and the others have to scramble to meet that
                    and meet it with subsidies or - in the case of the European Union - a
                    combination of subsidies and tariff barriers to keep other people's grains out.
                    You recall, back 35 years ago, we had a major export market in Europe for grains
                    and agricultural products of all kinds, and that's gone, disappeared. And we
                    discovered in the '70s high barriers in Europe, very high prices inside, so they
                    over-produce, then they have to sell that overproduction, and they sell it
                    abroad, and they sell it against the efficient producers, and to beat them they
                    have to subsidize it. So they lose on their agricultural policy two ways. They
                    produce more expensive food, and the consumers have to pay much more for it, and
                    then they pay a second time in the subsidies they have to pay to get rid of the
                    excess. That's extremely inefficient. It's a real money eater. We would fight
                    against them, but you're right, it's a political issue, and it was the issue
                    that stalled those trade talks for years and was finally resolved at a very high
                    level in '92.</p>

                    the GATT, and they've got probably more problems than the GATT did. The problems

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing with Japan? Did this involve you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Japan was a major consumer, but I don't recall that Japan was that
                    big a factor. They tried to keep their market, make sure there was a balance in
                    their market between suppliers from Asia, suppliers like us, and suppliers from
                    Europe. And we would have problems with them, for example when the... I'm
                    thinking about the Koreans, who are big rice growers and wanted to... where did
                    they want to dump some rice? They wanted to dump it somewhere, and it's a major,
                    very politically potent lobby in Washington for rice, so they would come and
                    beat on us to stop this, which we did. But the Japanese - I don't recall we had
                    any real contentious problems with them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing with China, as far as a market and
                        dealing witit? Did you get involved with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, just in these export enhancements, the question of selling six
                    million tons of wheat. But I would get involved in just making sure that the
                    State Department was behind either the original proposal or get the proposal
                    modified so that we could support it, and then it would take place.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in Paris from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: '92 to '96.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: I was the minister counselor for economic affairs at the OECD
                    mission. I had selected that post or for some years, kept an eye on it, because
                    I had promised my wife back in 1968 and told her that I'd take her back to Paris
                    some day to live, and I hadn't been able to do that, and this was the time to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the OECD at that time? I mean, what was its
                        coverage?I mean, what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, at the time, it was an organization that includes all of the
                    major Western industrial democracies plus Japan, New Zealand, and Australia, and
                    it was pretty much a sleepy organization until about '91-92, and it was kind of
                    a terminal place to go. Nobody ever gets promoted out of the OECD. It's kind of
                    a pre-retirement tour for a lot of people. But then, it was also the place in
                    the '70s and '80s, where if you had a really intractable international problem
                    that you couldn't make progress on politically, you'd shunt if off to the OECD,
                    have it looked at, have it staffed, and have it studied and talk about it there.
                    That takes it out of the spotlight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OECD stands for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It's the
                    outgrowth of the old OEEC, which was the operating system for the Marshall Plan.
                    And so over the years, for example, the International Energy Agency was created
                    within the OECD structure to address the energy problem in the 1970s. And then
                    in '92, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all of these Eastern European
                    countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and so on, all wanted links with
                    the West. For example, the preferred one was NATO. They wanted NATO, but NATO
                    had a clause that commits every member to defend every other member, which was
                    not something we were anxious to do with respect, say, to Poland. The other
                    organization they angled to get into was the European Union, but the European
                    Union has very high barriers to entry, and economically these countries weren't
                    ready for that. But they wanted some form of link with the West that would keep
                    them happy and would fend off the day when we would have to consider them for
                    NATO or the European Union, so the OECD came into the fore. So we wound up
                    bringing in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and then we added Korea during
                    the time I was there. And we had to, in effect, interview each of these
                    countries very, very carefully because the OECD is not an organization without
                    entry barriers of its own. You have to have convertible currencies; you have to
                    have free capital movements - so on and so forth. So we did a lot of work in
                    examining these countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it when you say “we” you're talking about the
                        othemembers, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, the other members. The other thing that's interesting about the
                    OECD is that all of the ideas, all of the motivations for the organization all
                    come from the United States. It's really quite extraordinary. The U.S. is
                    basically the only country that proposes new things for the OECD to consider.
                    Nobody else does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that would have sort of a stultifying
                        effecon the rest of the group.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: It does, and we never intended it that way, but they did not use the
                    OECD or did not see the OECD as an instrument that could further their national
                    policies, and we did. And so we used it. And then finally, I think it got to be
                    a habit. They just sort of sat back and let the Americans take the lead.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have though the French would have... you know, it's in Paris, and the
                    French don't like the United States leading anything. I would have thought they
                    would have been a -</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, sometimes they would be the ones that would say, “No, no, you
                    can't do this” or “you shouldn't do that” or “you should do it this way.” But
                    they never had ideas of their own, nor did the Europeans as a group were 16 of
                    the 27 members. But the French were very critical of some of the U.S. proposals,
                    and could get them modified if they made a convincing persuasive case, but they
                    never really projected... One time they sort of floated the idea that maybe the
                    OECD should extend its reach into North Africa, but they never pushed it very
                    strongly. It never seemed to be more than just an idea thrown up but not pushed
                    very hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the OECD doing? I mean, what was its
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, they had a vast variety of things. It ranged all the way from
                    setting standards for fruits and vegetables to international aviation standards.
                    We did aviation. AID standards, untying aid, reporting aid transactions. It was
                    an international energy agency; it was a forum for trade debates, sometimes very
                    technical, sometimes policy level. And then one of the things that was done
                    while I was there was to extend a hand to these newly independent countries of
                    Eastern Europe and give them assistance in the form of advice on how to set up a
                    central bank, how to set up statistical systems that enabled you to measure how
                    your economy was doing.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds like there are a lot of other organizations. The European Union is
                    setting up fruits and vegetable standards - whether cucumbers can be curved or
                    not - and you have the ICAO dealing with aviation - you know, I mean, each
                    country is going out and doing its own aid program and all - it sounds like you
                    were doing things, but any other countries were just doing what they or other
                    organizations were doing their thing.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, in a sense yes, but the OECD had this coordination function.
                    All of the members would keep each other in the picture on what they were doing
                    in these various fields, and one of the important things that the OECD had was
                    kind of a peer- pressure aspect. As you review somebody's economy - and another
                    part of their activity was to do an annual review of each economy, and they'd
                    provide advice or guidance - and we, for example, in the U.S. economy, we would
                    always try to send over somebody very senior from the Treasury Department who
                    would get a lot of questions about U.S. deficit or about other aspects that
                    weren't so hot in our economy. Sometimes they'd get very angry at being
                    questioned like this.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Q: From what you're saying, though, you're saying it's sort of a sleepy thing,
                    but it sounds like a rather key organization within the industrial world.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, it is, and it's probably not recognized as such by all that many
                    people. It is a key economic organization, and you're right, it could be a very
                    sleepy place at times.</p>
                <p>Q: But it sounds like a... The types of decisions and all that would be coming
                    out of here all sound controversial as all hell, that would set standards or how
                    to distribute aid and all that would all seem to be very political.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, yes. It was all politicized, but to the extent possible, it had
                    some of the political sting that these issues could have if debated openly,
                    pitting one country against the other. In the OECD, you could debate these
                    things, set standards, and inform each other of what you were doing and do it
                    sort of out of the limelight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what would happen when you'd set these standards?
                        Would countries go along with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, basically, it's a financial organization. It sets financial
                    standards for capital movements and so on, so that's a big part of the
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: The first ambassador was Alan Larson, who was a Foreign Service
                    officer and is now assistant secretary for economic affairs and may become the
                    undersecretary for economic affairs in the Department. He was there the first
                    year, and he was the one who hired me. I knew him pretty well. I'd worked for
                    him before, and so I went and saw him and asked to be considered for this job.
                    And I had a lot of push from Washington because I had done this thankless food
                    policy job and enjoyed it. So I got that job. That was Al's third year, and then
                    he was replaced by David Aaron, who's now the undersecretary for international
                    affairs at Commerce. And so he was there the three years, the last three years I
                    was there. I did a four-year tour there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major issues that you were in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: The major issue that I was involved in was the opening of Central and
                    Eastern Europe, and I did pretty much anything that anybody wanted done or the
                    ambassador wanted done. I became a speechwriter, wrote a lot of speeches for
                    him. And it was kind of funny because he's a professional writer. He writes
                    potboiler mysteries. And I wrote speeches for him. Basically, it was a nice
                    assignment. It was not a particularly testing one. I didn't really work
                    flat-out. But I sure lived flat-out in Paris. It's really a nice place.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, what about the new countries coming out of the former Soviet Union and
                    the Soviet Bloc? The criteria to get in, you must have had to cut a lot of
                    corners in order to get them in because they were - I mean they were coming out
                    of this authoritarian system.</p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, well, you did have to bend the rules. There were some rules,
                    though, that were critical to the organization, and one of those was the
                    convertibility of the currency, the free capital movements. You had to have
                    that; pretty much everything else could be negotiated. And what those countries
                    got out of it, was they would undergo the same kind of reviews that the others
                    did and point out to them some of the policy mistakes or any shortfalls they
                    were making and problems they were causing for themselves. I benefited them. It
                    does sort of knit you into the Western world. And it's still very sought
                    after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that your delegation and other Western
                        delegationwere acting as sort of tutors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, basically, that's it. They basically asked to btutored, and we
                    were happy to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with the Europeans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: We dealt with them... one of the things that made it easy to work in
                    the OECD was that all of the representatives to it were either located in the
                    same building or in the immediate vicinity, so it was really easy to stay in
                    touch with these folks. So we had good relations with everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then - '96, where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a wrench for your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Well, it was very hard for my wife. She had by that time, also, she'd
                    lived 24 years in France, really liked it, and so we came back and basically
                    came back to do the three years that I needed - I was 60 at the time - I needed
                    three years to get locality pay factored into my pension, and I will have that
                    in about another week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What have you been doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Since then I've worked in... I came back and did energy again. I did
                    that for two years, pretty much the same issues, although we had a little more
                    cooperation with OPEC this time. We went to producer meetings, but never at a
                    very senior level. They always send me. I remember I was in Goa, India, and my
                    instructions were just to keep my mouth shut, and all the other representatives
                    were ministers - Iran, Iraq, the UK, and so on. I got there and discovered that
                    they wanted to pass a resolution that I thought would be very damaging to our
                    interests, and it was a weekend and I couldn't get back to Washington to get any
                    instructions, so I just made up my own and made it very clear to the, you
                    know... It was one of those set-piece things where you have to notify the
                    Secretary a couple of days before you intend to make a submission, and then you
                    have to give them copies of it, and so on. And I said, “No,” I sort of broke in,
                    “I have to make a statement.” I read out a statement that I'd prepared that said
                    the United States objects to this and will not participate in this kind of a
                    meeting and so forth and so on, just sort of threw the cat among the canaries.
                    And as it turned out it was absolutely the right thing to do, but it really
                    caused a commotion. It caused a commotion there and it caused a commotion
                    afterwards. We had people coming up to for at least a year after and saying,
                    well, can't you modify that a little bit and have some formal meetings with
                    these OPEC producers? We said no.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I used to go back to Paris fairly frequently to attend IEA meetings. The other
                    thing, because I had a lot of experience with Canada, I always kept that as a
                    kind of a dossier that I was interested in, and the last year I was there I was
                    negotiating with the Canadians on renewing an electric power treaty that governs
                    the operation of one of the big dams in the Columbia River system, the
                    Bonneville Power Administration System, and then after a couple of years of
                    that, Ramsay retired, went to Paris to be the number two in the International
                    Energy Agency. By that time, my wife and I had become responsible for a pair of
                    aged old friends who had no children and no relatives, and so we had to take
                    over their affairs. And my wife, it turned out, became their sole beneficiary.
                    And so I had a couple of overseas possibilities. I wanted to go back overseas,
                    and I thought, Locality pay is fine, but this is not the place I want to be. So
                    I had a possibility of becoming the consul general in Istanbul, or going to
                    Brussels and working at NATO as some sort of deputy assistant secretary general
                    doing something with respect to energy with NATO. I couldn't pursue either of
                    those. I had to stay here. And about that time I started to have some real
                    problems with my knees, and so I wound up, by the time I knew I had to stay
                    here, the jobs were gone except for the... I tell you, this just feels kind of
                    funny... except for the job that was director of Canadian affairs, and I went
                    and I saw the guy who was recruiting for that, and he said, well, I'd had the
                    experience and negotiating with the Canadians, and he said, “Wow, you'd be just
                    perfect for this job.” So I thought I was really in on that one, and then I was
                    told that they wanted an ambassador as country director, because the Canadians
                    wanted somebody more senior. So they wound up with probably one of the few
                    five-way shootouts. They got five FEMC officers -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FEMC meaning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Meaning minister counselor level, very senior people - competing for
                    this job. And I had the most support for it, and so my career counselor thought,
                    well, you've got this made. So I went off to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan on a trip
                    and came back, and I didn't get a call, and I called in and I said, “What
                    happened?” He said, “Well, we had the five-way shootout - 13 people voting -
                    and, “ he said, “you got six votes in the first round, the other seven scattered
                    among the other four candidates.” And he said, “The guy who would have been your
                    seventh vote had to stay home and take care of a sick kid.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: So I never got the seventh vote. They had three or four votes, and
                    they finally gave it to this other guy. So I went and talked to the Office of
                    the Historian. By that time I figured I'm going to retire. I need one more year,
                    and I'll get out of here. So I talked to the Office of the Historian, and they
                    were looking for somebody to do the collating and writing of the documentary
                    history of the 1973 oil crisis, and they said, “Well, you have the experience
                    and knowledge.” And I said, “Yes, I'd love to do that.” But in the interim, I
                    had to get both my knees operated on and had both knees replaced, and so I was
                    basically out from September through to March doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of what, of '97?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Oh, that would be September of '98 to March of '99, and I've worked
                    at that since I returned in March, and I'll work up until the end of the year on
                    that and then I'm going to retire on December 31st. I was going to retire a
                    little bit earlier, but then I was afraid the Department might get efficient and
                    send me my leave check in '99, which would mean I'd have to pay taxes on it in
                    2000, so I decided... I always figured it was very unlikely that the Department
                    would be that efficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you can't tell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: You never know. I figured, well, it's worth working another couple of
                    weeks to get that. So I retire on December 31st. I may come back if they can get
                    me hired; I may come back to finish the job on a part-time basis, but if not,
                    then I'm gone - 41 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. That's a long time..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: Yes, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every place I went to. I had all
                    assignments that made me grow in one way or another. I would go back to any of
                    them except Yugoslavia right now. But I had a great time. I really enjoyed it,
                    and when I came into it I never figured I'd wind up doing 41 years of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEINGARTEN: That's a long time. It sure is. Anyway, it was fun. That's 41 years
                    of government service. I had 37 or 37 � with State department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great. Thank you.</hi>
