                <p>RONALD K. SOMERVILLE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: William D. MorganInterview date: September 21, 1999</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Mr. Somerville.]</p>
                <p>Q: This is an interview of Ronald Somerville. We worked together for many years
                    in consular affairs. Ron was the executive director of the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs and in many other positions in the United States government. He will
                    fill us in on how he came to the State Department and what he did there. Ron, as
                    a starting point, what brought you into the State Department and the United
                    States government?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Let me say at the outset, Bill, a disclaimer. Everybody who seems to
                    rise to a certain rank level wants to imply and leave the impression that this
                    has been a planned progression. In my case it was not. It may be unbelievable at
                    points but no matter how carefully you plan you don't know where it is
                    going.</p>
                <p>I came into government in the late '50s after the McCarthy mess, prior to the
                    Kennedy election campaign. I was a management intern with the old Civil Service
                    Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is now . . .?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Now it is OPM (Office of Personnel Management). It has a rather
                    different role now than it did then. Back in those days in the wake of McCarthy,
                    the Civil Service Commission included the International Organization Employee
                    Loyalty Board. In that capacity they ruled on the loyalty of candidates that the
                    US was proposing for appointment to any UN organization. They would work as US
                    citizens in the UN. They had to be cleared by the board. That board reflected
                    security responsibilities that were given in the wake of the McCarthy mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point of time are you talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, there had been many firings as a result of McCarthy; for
                    example, Robert Service in the State Department. There were many people who were
                    thought to be “pinkos” or fellow travelers and were removed and subsequently
                    became employees again. There was a defection, which you may remember, from the
                    National Security Agency in 1959. National Security was then known merely as a
                    part of the Department of Defense. It was at Fort Meade and did all the code
                    making, breaking, etc. Two gentlemen defected through Cuba to Russia and they
                    were thought to have taken great secrets with them.</p>
                <p>That triggered the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal
                    Security SubcommitteJay Sourwein, chief clerk, a nasty fellow; Carl Mundt,
                    senator from Montana, or somewhere, and a bunch of guys who had been strong
                    supporters of McCarthy. They were deeply imbued with the thought that the State
                    Department, in particular, was, had been and may still be run by “commies,”
                    pinkos, sympathizers, etc. Feelings were running high. They began clamoring for
                    jurisdiction as to who could hold a hearing and bare all the stuff that was
                    going on. I was called in by the director of personnel, with two
                    colleagues...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an intern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes, as an intern. I had no hooks, had been nowhere in the government
                    and therefore in a sense could be presumed to be unbiased. I was taken to a room
                    that was windowless and files were wheeled in on a cart. It was
                    unbelievable.</p>
                <p>These were the files of all the employees, many of whom were State Department
                    employees, who had been accused or alleged to be communist sympathizers, etc.
                    These were people who had been fired or suspended, many of whom were
                    subsequently, after the heat was down, put back on the roles in non-sensitive
                    jobs in other agencies. Many had gravitated back to the State Department if that
                    had been their original place of employment. This was after the “Who lost China”
                    stuff had all died down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was 1959, before the conventions of both parties in 1960 when a
                    deal was made. The chairman of the commission at that time was a gentleman named
                    Roger Jones. He was an Eisenhower Republican. He was trusted by the right wing.
                    He had the utmost integrity. A nice guy, too. A deal was made that in order to
                    keep this defection issue and the spin off issues (the Internal Security
                    Subcommittee and the Un-American Activities Committee wanted to get into a great
                    public display) from destroying the government, it was agreed that it would stay
                    out of the campaigns if both parties would agree that immediately upon election,
                    Roger Jones would move to the State Department, take custody of the files and
                    clean up the mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a balanced and non-political way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That went without saying. The election campaigns proceeded. Where
                    were all these people who were alleged to have been communists? The election was
                    held in November and by December of 1960 Roger Jones was moved from the Civil
                    Service Commission chairmanship to what was then called deputy undersecretary of
                    State for Administration. The position is now called the undersecretary of
                    State. His role was to clean up the mess in State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Find the spies and get rid of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: The whole bit. In any event, upon his arrival he immediately drew up
                    a reorganization that included a commitment we had not known about in the
                    commission during the campaigns. That commitment included the transfer, in toto,
                    of State Department's personnel security structure to the Civil Service
                    Commission. It merged with the security structure of the Commission which
                    included the whole government. In those days, all background investigations were
                    done by them and we were separate. If you wanted to be an employee of an
                    international organization, for instance, you had to be cleared by them. They
                    also did security up-dates [renewals of former clearances]. An exception: some
                    agencies like the FBI and State Department had their own. Well, it was presumed
                    because of “all” these pinkos in State and those “Who lost China?” types, and
                    all this background [involved], that the only way to clean up the mess in State
                    was to transfer all personnel security to the commission and merge it with a
                    legitimate operation. So, after Roger Jones had moved to the State Department,
                    before a new president was even in office, we in the commission began to draw up
                    tables of organization, tables with names, ranks for merging cross agencies,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And all the people we were talking about in State were
                        CiviService or were they both Civil Service and Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Both.</p>
                <p>Jones immediately set up a reorganization in which the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs, because it was internally security linked in those days, having deep
                    security connections because of refugee movements and East-West connections,
                    etc. It was set up as the supervising bureau over the Office of Personnel, the
                    Office of Security, the Inspector General, and the Office of Budget. All the
                    sensitive elements of the central structure of the State Department were placed
                    under the Bureau of Consular Affairs.Roger Jones reached into the Civil Service
                    Commission for one of his regional directors, Bernie Rosen, whom he brought over
                    as director of personnel for the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of personnel was under him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: You got it. He also neutralized the Director General so that the
                    Foreign Service could not get their hands back on this personnel cluster. So you
                    had Roger Jones, chairman of the commission, as deputy undersecretary of
                    administration anBernie Rosen as director of personnel. Then he brought in a
                    brilliant guy from the Rand Corporation which did a lot of defense stuff and was
                    clean. He became a principal deputy and planning architect.</p>
                <p>Things began to roll down the road. I worked in inspections, then in the Civil
                    Service Commission, and was involved in inspecting federal agency personnel
                    systems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including now the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, not at the time I was in the field. Later on I did inspect part
                    of State's allegations of Kenny O'Donald and a number of the Kennedy rat pact
                    who were running rough shod over Merit Rose and hiring only Catholics. There was
                    a great Catholic-Jewish brouhaha in government during the Kennedy
                    administration. You may not recall that the Labor Department was seen to be all
                    Jews and the average mafia had to take over. We had some of the same problems in
                    the State Department and there was an investigation by the Civil Service
                    Commission of these allegations that the Kennedy crew had corrupted the
                    personnel system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the entire State Department overseas assignments under
                        thCSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Absolutely, how else could they get control? How coulyou reveal and
                    discover and purge?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are saying the one of the objectives was to
                        purge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. That was part of the arrangement made before the elections,
                    including Roger Jones moving over to the State Department, whether the
                    government was Democratic or Republican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't see how it worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It worked marvelously. It defused this battle between the Un-American
                    Activities Committee and the Internal Security Subcommittee that could have
                    destroyed the executive branch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you suggesting that was why it was done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That was the deal that was made going into convention when it was
                    apparent that Kennedy would be the winner. It was done in order to prevent this
                    from getting into the campaigns the nominees agreed that would happen no matter
                    who was elected. That was the solution and it worked. Maybe there were better
                    ideas. I don't know.</p>
                <p>Anyway, my immediate boss in the Civil Service Commission was transferred over to
                    the State Department as another deputy to Bernie Rosen, the new director of
                    personnel. In this capacity he had to do with Foreign Service hiring. Obviously
                    the whole thing was being de-Wristonized [laterally commissioned Foreign Service
                    officers from the Civil Service], or whatever, and converted into a non-Foreign
                    Service kind of an organization. It had that flavor.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I arrived he called me and said, “Hey, Ron. We are going to have
                    some fun. Look at all the things that are going to be done.” By then I had
                    become an inspector but still had the idea that merit should rule and politics
                    or corruption shouldn't influence. I was not cynical but very idealistic. I felt
                    this way, based upon what I knew from the onset of the defection of the guys at
                    NSA down through what was evolving under the Kennedy administration. I thought
                    that it might be a lot of fun over there [in the State Department] and there
                    might be a chance to do some things. So, I said, “Yes, I would.” I transferred
                    and became the chief of non-Foreign Service officer employment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give us a date on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That would have been in 1962. The year before thassassination.</p>
                <p>By that time a whole lot of things had gone wrong. There was a new secretary of
                    state, Dean Rusk. The new deputy undersecretary for administration had been
                    fairly well neutralized by a force so potent that he never realized it could
                    exist. It was the Foreign Service. He had become rather neutralized. The
                    reorganization placed [him in] CA (Bureau of Consular Affairs)...it was headed
                    by the administrator of Consular Affairs. At the time it was the only statutory
                    position in the entire Department of State. It was the only position that could
                    call upon, or be called upon, by a committee of congress other than those having
                    normal oversight. The judiciary committees [of the House and Senate] controlled
                    immigration. It was unique. Because of its uniqueness in that way it was watched
                    by [House] judiciary and judiciary in the Senate [which] included, of course,
                    Internal Security.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The reorganization had begun to go awry. They spun off personnel first, the
                    inspector general second, and security third to be individual entities reporting
                    through an A (Administration) structure, not as a part of CA's jurisdiction.
                    They had appointed a gentleman who was very close to immigration interests
                    organization as an administrator. He was a true, trusted political hack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds familiar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Because of what was being attempted, the [Democratic] party felt they
                    had to have a certain kind of individual. So rather than being a Rusk person he
                    was a Kennedy person. However, he had certain weaknesses. Among those were a
                    pension for painting the walls in his office over one weekend six times,
                    different colors of pink and lavender. It conjures up a certain image. Well,
                    that was conjured by Frances Knight and pumped out through her husband, Wayne
                    Parish who was the Cleveland Plain Dealer representative in Washington. He owned
                    US Airline Guide and Aviation Daily. He was a very influential journalist.</p>
                <p>To digress for a moment, Frances' background was a public relations speech writer
                    type. When Richard Nixon first ran against Helen Gilhagen Douglas in California,
                    she is alleged to have written speeches that conjured up Douglas as soft on
                    Communism. This was published in a pink paper's notice which is where the word
                    pinkos comes from. So, of course, Nixon won that election. During the later
                    Eisenhower years, around 1957, when Marge Shipley retired from the Passport
                    Office, Frances Knight replaced her and became a fixture because of her links
                    that were very tight with J. Edgar Hoover, Bill Sullivan, his deputy, and a
                    third man whose name escapes me, in the FBI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We must take pause to let the reader know that Frances
                        Knighdied just last week.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: By way of her background she was extremely right wing. She was known
                    to be behind a prolific system of tracking US citizens travel abroad. She dealt
                    through the cable system directly with consular sections in shadowing Americans'
                    travel abroad. She provided to the FBI and received from the FBI comprehensive
                    reporting on the movements of Americans abroad. She was very active in denying
                    passports to people whose loyalty might be questioned. She was very active in
                    all kinds of travel control programs that were launched from time to time. She
                    was a very tough lady.</p>
                <p>Q: Today, anyone who is wanted by a United States magistrate is subject to alert
                    through the State Department and perhaps to extradition back to the U.S.
                    jurisdiction..</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes, that has always been legal. That is entirely different from
                    prohibiting the travel of an American citizen not indicted, a free citizen. If
                    there is no court involved you have the constitutional right to travel. It was
                    alleged that she was abridging that right by her denial patterns.</p>
                <p>Q: But, it held up. It was documented. There were the cards and “airgrams”
                    (surface mail, versus telegrams) that went out from her office. Cables
                    [telegrams] also were sent out.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It went on until Dean Rusk personally admonished her anordered her to
                    cease and desist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To cease and desist all of these things that you have
                        listed thawere not legal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That's right.</p>
                <p>Let me give you a little bit more of the dynamics that were happening at the time
                    I arrived. The new Administration obviously wanted to hit the deck running as
                    fast as it could. They had a mess in the State Department but they delivered on
                    their commitment to bring Roger Jones over, began some organizational changes.
                    They brought in some very tight but political-hack type people from the Kennedy
                    administration who were not much on governmental expertise perhaps but very keen
                    politicians and very close with the family.</p>
                <p>The security apparatus in the State Department had been successfully defeated
                    with plans transferred to the Civil Service Commission. A gentleman from the CIA
                    was hired as the head of security. You can see the pattern here. All of the
                    controls were replaced in the State Department. I wouldn't say it was a purge
                    but it was damn close to it. This was arising from dynamics set in motion many
                    years before with McCarthy, picked up again with the NSA people and arrangements
                    and commitments made going into the election. Kennedy was not soft on communism.
                    He was a harsh as Eisenhower ever was.</p>
                <p>Despite these changes in personnel and structure, the [State Department's] Office
                    of Security was successfully damaging the flow of appointments of ambassadors,
                    under secretaries, who by the right wing were suspect of being at least soft on
                    communism if not card-bearing. These were choked in the pipeline. Clearances
                    didn't get finished. Clearances were not granted preventing appointments. There
                    is provision in law, in Executive Order called “180 day clearance”. In an
                    emergency a cabinet officer has the right to bring a person on board in a
                    sensitive position prior to the granting of a security clearance. So, the Rusk
                    administration began to use this 180-day clearance procedure as its only means
                    of filling the jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't mean there wasn't a security procedure that had
                        beedone or was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was an ongoing thing. No appointments were made without the
                    initiation, to my personal knowledge, of at least the federal agency check. The
                    House Un-American Activities Committee had an index; Internal Security had an
                    index; Justice had an index etc.; and those were checked minimally. But the
                    field work of background investigations and interviews, etc., were not
                    completed.</p>
                <p>The system became clogged and more or less in desperation the Administration went
                    to a prolific use of the 180-day waiver. This, of course, inflamed the
                    right-wing who were sure that this was nothing more than Kennedy bringing in a
                    bunch of pinkos. And some of the names involved were very liberal.</p>
                <p>There was a gentleman in the Office of Security who was so pained by this change
                    that he became a public figure, an obstructionist, alleging that gross
                    improprieties were taking place in security in the State Department. His name
                    was Otto Otepka. For many years he had been the head of the investigating
                    division. He had seen his empire almost transferred to the Civil Service
                    Commission and the efforts of his field agents, which were being so thorough,
                    that nothing moved, usurped by the 180-day procedure. He went public through The
                    Richmond News Leader, an extremely right-wing publication at that time. He
                    became a pariah. While this was going on, I as chief of Officer Employment
                    discovered that I had two employees who were involved. One, as a flow point for
                    Otepka's material.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by “flow point”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was through her that Otepka's material was being feto The Richmond
                    Leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I presume this was more than just sensitive material.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I won't say that it was security sensitive but certainly privacy
                    sensitive and damaging stuff about some of the people who were being appointed.
                    Information from security backgrounds, etc., material that could only come from
                    security files. Very suggestive stuff. Anyway, I found that I had another
                    employee who was actively involved in dealing with senior candidates in
                    distributing J. Edgar Hoover's book. She had a crate of these damn things in her
                    office and she was passing them out to all the candidates to warn them. Well,
                    here I am, a young guy from the Civil Service Commission not knowing anybody in
                    the State Department trying to run an operation and I had to deal with the
                    folks.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Well, it turns out that Otto Otepka was typing his material in Frances Knight's
                    office. I told you this was unbelievable. He was producing his material in her
                    office with her knowledge, using J. Edgar Hoover intelligence. I knew this
                    because there were times I was in her office and she would telephone across and
                    get input from over there. I was required to chastise and stop what they were
                    doing. I couldn't stop the flow to the Richmond News Leader because that was
                    done off premises, but I got rid of the publications, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who ordered you to stop it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I do not recall but I think the relationship between me and my
                    supervisor and his supervisor and the deputy under secretary for Administration
                    was such that perhaps there wasn't a need for an order. I was an idealist young
                    guy and had an idea how the government should work and these operations were not
                    the right way. You don't destroy people's reputations with information you are
                    privileged to have, and should treat it accordingly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the officials concerned felt, if not ideologically
                        exactly ayou did, in principle, that this was the wrong thing to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. My immediate superior was a Foreign Service officer, a very
                    senior guy of impeccable credentials and not a captive of the sabotage that was
                    being perpetrated on the new deputy under secretary for Administration. So I
                    enjoyed working for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had been in State long enough to have a feeling
                        for whawas evolving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. That was a little bit of the climate that existed. I had nothing
                    to do with CA at this time. I was solely in the Office of Personnel as a
                    recruiter seeking officers, and getting them through clearances, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sort of lost. Wasn't it part of CA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: By the time I arrived it was functioning autonomously again. Let me
                    put it this way. The person who had been appointed by the new administration to
                    the CA administrator's job, with all the subordinates under attack sufficiently
                    by then, felt that it was wise to spin apart the pieces. That combined with the
                    kinds of pressures that the “system” was bringing to bear on Roger Jones
                    because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Inspector General?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That was sacrosanct. It was a different idea than it was now. It was
                    wholly and solely a Foreign Service entity. It solely looked at embassies and
                    that sort of thing. Non-Foreign Service management did not diddle with the
                    Inspector General. Well, that had been taken away and put under this guy from
                    the Civil Service Commission. You can see the anger. I won't say it was right or
                    wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that legal? It was in the Foreign Service Act.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was legal. Administratively you can move it wherever you want to.
                    Remember you didn't have the Inspector General Act that you and I are used to
                    for the last 20 years. Then it didn't exist.</p>
                <p>And the responsibilities of the Inspector General inferentially were the totality
                    of the non- Civil Service part of the personnel system as stated in law. So they
                    made it an ineffectual job. It was a sit on the side, get out of the way, we are
                    running the show.</p>
                <p>Q: It was perhaps more a job of looking into things that might need cops, if you
                    will, rather than today's role of an inspector general on policy.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, in those days a major objective of having the Foreign Service
                    inspection operation wasn't limited to the appropriate stewardship of money,
                    property, etc. It was also to make sure that we didn't have ambassadors and
                    staff who went native. There was a great concern of clientitis in those days.
                    That the staff would become strong advocates for a point of view that they were
                    no longer functioning in the broader U.S. national interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That still is a question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: And it always will be. This concerned Kissinger when he came in and
                    he designed the GLOP program. He took people out of their geographical areas and
                    made them move, because their loyalties became distorted, internally and
                    externally.</p>
                <p>Q: Let me stop, Ron, for just a minute. There is something that I think the
                    reader needs to know a little more about. What was your background before you
                    became an intern. Where did you grow up and go to school?</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I am from Pennsylvania and spent a couple of years in the Service.
                    Always had an interest in government. In high school I came down for an
                    inauguration of a president with a bunch of friends. Strange as it may seem
                    there is a building catty- corner from the White House, across from the Old
                    Executive Office building. We came down, pulled down the fire escape on the
                    back, climbed on top of the building and were opposite the presidential
                    reviewing stand watching the parade and waving at everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't do that any more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I graduated from Pennsylvania University in industrial psychology. I
                    went through the management intern exam including interviews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the way you came into the Civil Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That was the mechanism then from which I got my firsassignment to the
                    Civil Service Commission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you are now plugged in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That, of course, was totally concerned with personnerelated
                    activities for the government.</p>
                <p>Here's is a little aside that is funny. When I joined the State Department you
                    filled out a little piece of paper to go into the Stud Book (Biographical
                    Register). I was required to state what I had been doing previously. I put down
                    Civil Service Commission, listing no responsibilities. So, for 15 years I was
                    seen to be a CIA plant in the State Department.</p>
                <p>Along the way I was offered the job of personnel officer for what was then the A
                    Bureau, the Administration Bureau, which was different than it is presently
                    concocted. It had fiscal operations as well as other operations. It did not have
                    security, the inspector general or personnel. By the time this happened, the CA
                    superstructure had nearly been dismantled administratively, not legally. The
                    administrator was more and more isolated from operations and greater autonomy
                    had been given to the Visa Office, the Passport Office, and Services to
                    Americans Abroad Office, which Frances Knight (as head of the Passport Office)
                    was still trying to gobble up.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CA had become a holding company. It didn't have its own budget. There was a visa
                    budget, a passport budget and no significant central control between those and
                    the Department, OMB and congress. By intent, it was being dismantled. This was
                    because of the fracas about the political appointee who had been placed in the
                    administrator's position by the Kennedy administration.</p>
                <p>In moving to the A Bureau personnel officer job I moved into one of
                    responsibility again for servicing CA to the extent anybody supported them to a
                    personnel sense because the CA assistant secretary's level had no involvement.
                    It was very strange. So, I did the classification, assignments and all the
                    personnel stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the staff to go along with these
                        responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I inherited two people who came from CA. Bear in mind this was not
                    really a control structure. Nobody wanted to sit on top of Frances Knight.
                    Nobody wanted to get in her way because they would be shot. The Foreign Service
                    was an overseas thing by itself and the Visa Office didn't really deal anywhere
                    else.</p>
                <p>At this time I was also given residual responsibility for the care and feeding of
                    Otto Otepka. By now his case had progressed through “grievances” [appeals] in
                    the court and he was in a holding pattern. They placed him in a building by
                    himself where Virginia Avenue now exists. There was a State Annex there. It was
                    a building that was to be torn down and Virginia Ave was to be constructed. He
                    called in reporters and showed them the rats and the mice and all hell was
                    raised about the mistreatment of this poor super American patriot, etc. I had to
                    give him desk space, meet with him once a week, make sure he got all the
                    directives in the system and create the charade that somehow he wasn't an
                    outcast. He was integrated into the organization, and given all the
                    communications he needed to do his job, etc. In the mean time he is hold up in
                    Frances Knight's office producing a book. Through some contortion and
                    convolution in the security stuff, I became suspect of being one of his flow
                    points to the Richmond News Leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. You associated with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Without mentioning any names it became known to me that the space I
                    was in, then State Annex 2, had previously been security space and had
                    microphones and those were turned on. I will tell you, Bill, for about six
                    months I had the most marvelous time. I worked late and engaged in fictitious
                    conversations and fed more stuff. Oh, it was marvelous.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>In the service role of the Bureau for Consular Affairs, I was called by the then
                    deputy under secretary for Administration, a gentleman by the name of Bill
                    Crockett, and told there was a lady in an office on the fifth floor, for whom we
                    have to create an office organizationally and staff with two people. This will
                    become a second special advisor to the secretary. There was a senior advisor to
                    the secretary on refugee affairs. This was to be something like that, a senior
                    advisor on consular affairs. Go see the lady and set it up.</p>
                <p>So, I went to the office and Barbara Watson was sitting there. She introduced
                    herself and didn't have the foggiest notion what the State Department was. She
                    had been brought down from New York City to be appointed in this consultant
                    role. I didn't know what was going on. I created, honestly, an office to support
                    this senior advisor outside of CA. I got space, set up an office, got a couple
                    of secretaries, etc. After this was all done I learned that this was a
                    transitory position to the administrator for Security and Consular Affairs. Bare
                    in mind this was just a shell and existed only in law and not at all
                    administratively, authoritatively, budget-wise, or position-wise. She was
                    sponsored by John Rooney, who had been the district attorney in Brooklyn, and a
                    close friend of Barbara Watson's-Barbara was there preparatory to being
                    appointed the Administrator of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs,
                    which at the time comprised only the Passport Office, the Visa Office and the
                    Office of Citizen Services. The only security aspect that it had, had to do with
                    the prevention of security risks from entering the U.S. via the visa processing
                    system or curtailing of travel by Americans under indictment, on the passport
                    side. These were both under legislation. The first one under the Immigration and
                    Nationality Act; the second, I think, was in the act that created the
                    bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get a date on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: In September of 1968, Barbara Watson was nominated,confirmed and
                    appointed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her predecessor was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: A name I cannot remember. [Abba P. Schwartz 1962-66] The position was
                    vacant at the time. It was a person who had been fired. Rusk called him and told
                    him he was no longer an employee having been targeted by the right-wing on the
                    Hill, and engaged in practices that became notorious. Although in ethnic and
                    migration circles he was highly regarded. He was a lawyer with a long time
                    association with legal immigration issues, particularly with regard to
                    refugees.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The election took place in November and of course Richard Nixon won. In reviewing
                    his appointments he decided very early in the game, in January, the month of his
                    swearing in, that it was in his political and administrative interest to retain
                    the very fresh, brand new administrator for Consular Affairs, Barbara
                    Watson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In skills. In terms of credentials and background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: She was qualified and more importantly she was politically important
                    in that Nixon had to deal with John Rooney on the appropriations side, with Dr.
                    Morgan Utters on the international relations side, with Carl Mundt and the
                    current conservatives who had found her sufficiently acceptable to confirm her.
                    And lastly, if he opened the position up, he would have grave difficulty getting
                    through the various factions and interests anytime soon to appoint a
                    successor.There was another element that was not seen and that was that Barbara
                    Watson was the most senior black woman ever in the history of the State
                    Department. First black assistant secretary, first female assistant secretary.
                    She broke many, many of the old “rules”. Politically acceptable to both parties.
                    She could not be penetrated by Frances Knight. Here you have Nixon, for whom she
                    had worked many years before, as a new president reflecting what he knew to be
                    the case in terms of dealing with Frances Knight.</p>
                <p>He left Barbara Watson in the position. Strengthened her by recreating the
                    bureau, authorizing the creation of a staff and directed that the staff should
                    manage a bureau entity and that all office directors within the bureau should
                    report only through the administrator for the Bureau of Security and Consular
                    Affairs. The visa director at the time was Ray Collum, a strong personality.
                    Frances Knight, a very partisan political person would be managed by a black
                    woman who had good political credentials, was astute, bright, imposing, and
                    seemingly acceptable by the State Department's Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter I was called and asked if I would please come aboard. In truth
                    she didn't know where to turn. It was suggested by the then assistant secretary
                    for administration, John Thomas, with whom, I had grave disagreements — I cared
                    not at all for some of his style — that she consider me as personnel
                    officer/deputy executive director. He noted that she had to have a Foreign
                    Service person in as executive director because the organization was principally
                    overseas, a Foreign Service organization. Because of our problems, he offered to
                    give her my position, with me. So, I had the distinct honor of arriving with the
                    position on my forehead, thus removing a thorn from his side and fulfilling an
                    obligation that he had to make sure that the bureau was put back into a
                    structural soundness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And with someone who was qualified to do it and knew
                        enough abouthe department and the machinations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Probably more the latter than the former. This was the time when
                    there was a gentleman by the name of Bill Crockett who was the deputy under
                    secretary for administration, now called the under secretary for management.
                    These fit together very nicely because Barbara came in from outside, a total
                    non-fit for the State Department, being senior black and senior female. The
                    Foreign Service didn't like either one of them, and arranged its affairs
                    generally for them, except in very subordinate positions or in consular
                    sections. Bill Crockett, who was very close to John Rooney, was a Foreign
                    Service Staff officer whose wife never forgot the indignities that she suffered
                    from the Foreign Service officers. Mr. Crockett was also very close to Wayne
                    Hays.</p>
                <p>During those years we went through a very stressful “Oh, dear, what should we be?
                    Oh, dear, what should we be?” There were personnel studies after studies. Should
                    we be Domestic Service? Should we be Foreign Service? Should we merge? How
                    should we restructure ourselves to be effective? There was commission after
                    commission. The Wriston Commission. The Hoover Commission. Anyway, it was
                    decided with Wayne Hays' strongest support that we really should be one Service
                    and that is the only way you are going to get rid of this rivalry between the
                    Staff officers and the Foreign Service officers and the Civil Service
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was getting more extreme and more complex and
                        confusing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Wayne Hays was chairman of two powerful entities on the Hill. First,
                    for the State Department, he was chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
                    foreign operations in the State Department. Probably of greater interest to him,
                    and the Congress, was that he was full chairman of the House Administration
                    Committee. What does that mean? He assigns space, staff, dollars and parking
                    permits to every congressman. Therefore, he had in those days ultimate power.
                    There was no congressman in the Hill structure that had more power.</p>
                <p>In any event, Wayne Hays, John Rooney and Leo Ryan hated Frances Knight and
                    supported Barbara Watson. Nixon decided for all these reasons to keep her in
                    place to put together the bureau. I joined the bureau as personnel officer with
                    the new executive director, Jerry Wetzork, a nice fellow. We began an operation
                    which rapidly was perceived to be one of outcasts. Outcasts of the Passport
                    Office because it was seen as a non-player, and outside the purview of any
                    professional interest in the State Department. A non-player as far as the Visa
                    function and its massive staff abroad, because those were technicians who
                    handled those dirty smelling foreigners and didn't go to the parties or have the
                    same titles. They rarely got the decent space abroad because they had to have
                    big waiting rooms with lots of immigrants coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And still a lot of staff officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was a mixture, but mostly Staff officers despite the Rogers Act in
                    1924. But then because of the Hays program it became really bastardized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't told us about the Wayne Hays program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Wayne Hays felt that the Department of State could only be
                    effectively managed if we got rid of the rivalries. We would have one type of
                    officer that he saw as a Foreign Service Reserve/Foreign Service officer. He saw
                    the Reserve officer as a transitional mode to a single structure of Foreign
                    Service officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Staff, to Reserve, to officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: From staff to reserve and eventually to officer; or on the Civil
                    Service side, from Civil Service to Reserve to officer. He felt strongly that
                    only with a single service could you get rid of this rivalry once and for all
                    because the problems were readily apparent. We had no consular officers in
                    significant senior positions in the Department. They could not aspire to be
                    ambassadors. They rarely got to be principal officers even though a post's
                    primary staffing function and responsibility was consular. A Foreign Service
                    officer, typically going the political route, was perceived and in fact was the
                    most favorite when it came to the more responsible positions, and therefore
                    promotions. Rarely did a consular officer who was also a Foreign Service officer
                    ever become what was then FSO-1, the senior most Foreign Service rank. The
                    reason they didn't had less to do with their abilities and performance but more
                    to do with the fact that they were not permitted to seek assignments that
                    qualified them both for visibility and for a record of performance in the more
                    senior jobs.</p>
                <p>Q: I might throw in what was true at the time of the Rogers Act, and continued:
                    consular work tended to be more technical, more repetitive...</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It tended to be like that other non-starter in the Foreign Service:
                    administration. There were many efforts over the years during my tenure to join
                    together the two career specialties. They both stem from law and regulation and
                    finite fixed things and merely required you to relate a body of written
                    information to a situation to a solution, without any real analytical judgment.
                    They didn't have to understand [substantively] foreign governments and peoples
                    and culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It took care of the social superiority of the diplomatic
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: How much Wayne Hays saw of this on his own and how much he was
                    influenced by Bill Crockett, no one really knows. There was then an attempt to
                    pass legislation to merge the two. The Foreign Service officers were very
                    strongly against what was seen by them as diluting their ranks. They were
                    instrumental in having other elements in congress stop the legislation. Wayne
                    Hays vowed that with his hammer over the State Department he would show his
                    colleagues that the employees, other than those blue noses, really wanted to do
                    this. He encouraged the Department to administratively achieve the same
                    objective. Hence we began what was called the Hays program. This was a program
                    of convincing the employees, Staff and Civil Service officers, that it was in
                    their best interest to volunteer for conversion to the Foreign Service Reserve
                    Corps carrying with them their career status and eventually moving into the
                    Foreign Service retirement system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Reserve officer corps at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: The reserve appointment authority [in the Foreign Service Act] began
                    to be used, and some would say bastardized extensively, by the new Kennedy
                    administration. They saw themselves being hamstrung in every other direction
                    they took to assume the reins of power in the State Department. They couldn't
                    get their own people in easily and when they did, those people were not able to
                    get control of the structure. They were titularly there but not really there.
                    There was an intervening structure they had to create and they did it by the use
                    of the FSR, the Foreign Service Reserve appointment authority which until then
                    had been used only for doctors, deep, deep specialists, or clearly transitory
                    appointments from Social Security Administration or Department of Defense, etc.,
                    some other appointing authority; it didn't stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And an appointment that could only last five years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. That was non-renewable administratively. Legally, the
                    appointment was limited to five years but there was no statutory language
                    prohibiting subsequent FSR appointments. So there were people who served for a
                    number of tours successively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By and large, however, they were in positions that no one
                        woulever raise a question about, like a medical officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. A highly specialized skill. They weren't a threat to anyone's
                    career field or assignment opportunity. They were non-threatening.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The Hays program was a massive one. It was a very costly one for the US
                    government. It was one of the stupidest things that was ever done. I had the
                    dishonor or ignoble job to be responsible principally for the program. We had
                    daily seminars and briefings and I had to call Bill Crockett's office every
                    evening at 5:00 and tell them how many people converted that day, from the Civil
                    Service or the staff. That was then passed over to Wayne Hays to further
                    convince him and keep his eye on the ball in getting the rest of his colleagues
                    up there to agree to release the Hays Bill which would give us statutory basis
                    for this.</p>
                <p>Q: The staff corps could see that it was advantageous to it, other than from the
                    competition aspect. If they got the word correctly they would have realized they
                    wouldn't vie successfully in most cases because of the officer promotion system
                    which was highly competitive. But, the civil servant in State could see,
                    perhaps, how he could grow with this conversion.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Not only could [the Civil Service officer] grow, but he was clearly
                    told that this was what his management wanted him to do. For example, for family
                    and personal reasons I did not feel free to try and join the Foreign Service.
                    However, I felt greatly constrained to convert to the Foreign Service Reserve
                    program because I was charged with making it work. So, I converted to the
                    Foreign Service Reserve. I never had an intent of going abroad. I accepted the
                    appointment under the ground rules that were then in place administratively,
                    which was no obligation to serve abroad. It was to be as though I had continued
                    in a Civil Service capacity except that my label would change, my pay system
                    would change and my promotion system would change. I became an FSR-2.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were competitive with FSRs or with FSOs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Bill, it was mumble-jumble over the years. The criteria changed over
                    the years. The composition of the boards changed. I was very fortunate and
                    promoted from FSR-2 to FSR-1. I am sure there were Foreign Service officers who
                    wondered “who the hell is this? A non-Foreign Service person taking up a slot.”
                    And, I am sure there was resentment. Naturally so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because there were just “X” number of promotions and
                        you goone in your class as an “R.” How did that manifest itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, because of where I was in CA, I don't think I experienced much
                    of anything from my colleagues whether they were Foreign Service or Civil
                    Service. I was seen more as an executive director and was working for a powerful
                    assistant secretary of Consular Affairs. We either intruded ourselves or were
                    invited into the assignment process, promotion number allocation, not the panel
                    process of deciding who won. We obtained the resources necessary to create the
                    positions, staff them, furnish them. I didn't recognize any resentment to
                    me.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't think there was either, because you did all these things that were
                    necessary and good for the consular bureau. I think few knew of your promotion,
                    or cared. It was a non-issue because you did absolutely everything; and even
                    more: you taught us how to do it. Now, everyone would walk away smiling.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: To digress. Up until the time we began to recreate, reconstitute and
                    reform the front office of CA there had been little opportunity for consular
                    officers to get involved in anything that would expose them to how the Hill
                    worked, how the Office of Management and Budget worked, how the Internal
                    Acquisition and Allocation of Resources worked. They knew nothing of the
                    processes.</p>
                <p>Q: They didn't want to know. It was only when they served in personnel or some
                    place associated with you, like the computer in the Visa Office as I was, that
                    one realized that there was power, in the good sense. And you supported them and
                    translated some of these “technical” things. You protected me in the Visa Office
                    from somebody who hated that sort of thing, and was scared of it. SOMERVILLE:
                    This was an anathema to Julio Arias, who kind of epitomized the old staff
                    consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was an employee out there to get through to
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That was the man who was thrown out by Frances Knight and for
                    political reasons we were asked to find a home for him. I didn't solve this
                    problem, Diego Asencio did. Immediately after appointment as assistant
                    secretary, he got a call from the Hill. Wayne Hays was sitting on the State
                    Department authorization bill and had been doing this for a period of several
                    weeks. There was a real risk that we would not be reauthorized. Pat Kennedy went
                    to visit the gentleman with the then under secretary for management. I had
                    warned them in advance what was going to happen. Pat Kennedy called Diego
                    Asencio from the office on the Hill to say that his first payback opportunity
                    was coming now and here is what it is. “You have a gentleman in the Passport
                    Office who is isolated, ostracized, sitting in an office with no lights and no
                    heat and you are going to have to do something for this person”. So, you got
                    him.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Q: He was on board when I arrived as deputy director of VO (the Visa Office). I
                    was told that part of my new job I was taking on was to keep this “special
                    politically sponsored soul from the Passport Office” and Julio Arias, the head
                    of the Visa Office, apart, from each others' throats.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Was Helen Mulholland still there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, she had left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: She sued Barbara Watson for sex discrimination for bringing that
                    gentleman in and taking her responsibilities. This reached the point of
                    depositions, after Barbara had been de-hired [and replaced by a Republican
                    appointee: Leonard Walentynowicz]. She served twice you know. She came back with
                    the promise that Carter would get rid of Frances Knight. That was the only
                    caveat she insisted upon to come back to the office.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, the reader should know clearly that none of this is gossip. This is all
                    personnel management of the highest order and all true. This is all factual,
                    interpersonal relationships.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: The first time Barbara was de-hired she was made ambassador to
                    Malaysia. The second time she was de-hired she returned to civilian life. The
                    lady in the Visa Office whose job was usurped by the gentleman [from the
                    Passport office] sued Barbara Watson for sex discrimination having given a
                    female's duties and responsibilities to a male. I went over and wrote Barbara's
                    deposition in her apartment on Queen Ann's Lane, she being a non-employee at the
                    time but not at the time covered by the suit. The lady didn't succeed because
                    the case had no merit. It was a very unfortunate case because she was a nice
                    lady and had put a life time of effort into the job and felt she had been
                    terribly treated.</p>
                <p>Q: And this is the bottom line of so many personnel, congressional, executive
                    branch, intercessions in personnel actions. It's real and you just happen to
                    have one of those jobs that stayed mostly to the center of that.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Okay. Let's take a little digression into the area oautomation, work
                    engineering, process design and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, do that in terms of the point in which we have
                        reached iour discussion: the establishment of the new bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Okay, but in truth I have to go behind that a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you should.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I am essentially relating to you things in which I was personally
                    involved, not things that evolved around me. I had to meet with Wayne Hays on
                    numerous occasions carrying him ammunition to fire at Frances Knight. I had to
                    meet with John Rooney in his office on the Hill carrying him ammunition to throw
                    back and shoot at Frances Knight. I spent time with him creating scenarios that
                    could be used to strengthen the consular function, whether it was dealing with
                    the secretary, the under secretary for management, etc. These comments are only
                    things in which I participated in.</p>
                <p>Q: I would argue that the first things that you faced in terms of our chronology
                    here of setting up CA was Frances Knight. I think, excuse the expression, she
                    has to be done away with in the sense that Barbara had a terrible time as the
                    new leader, leading in comparison to other “principals” - heads of bureaus - in
                    the State Department.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Before we go to the automation side let me talk about that. As
                    Barbara Watson assumed her new duties she was immediately targeted by Frances
                    Knight for demise. Frances worked her will on the Hill in an attempt to further
                    disestablish the bureau and prevent it from being reconstituted, recreated,
                    reorganized. She attempted to have it de-funded. She accused Barbara Watson of
                    needing officers around her all the time. She alluded to the senior staff
                    members around Barbara Watson as hand holders. She alleged she only spoke words
                    that were stuffed in her mouth by others. She alleged that the woman had to be
                    scripted for everything that she did. She did this through her husband, Wayne
                    Parish in the Cleveland Plain Dealer which had entree into a very strong Ohio
                    Republican congressional delegation. There were some very strong folks through
                    Karl Mundt. and basically through the ideological right wing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a holdover from the McCarthy era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. Frances built up a fierce reputation as a hard nose manager. She
                    got the job done. She created statistical material every year about how much
                    money she made for the Treasury and how little it cost. Of course, she didn't
                    compare it against anything. What we found early in the game was that in
                    reviewing the annual financial data as we began to put together a coordinated,
                    consolidated, single CA presentation, I discovered negative obligations in a
                    particular account in the Passport Office, which meant that somehow an account
                    had more money in it at the end of the year then had been given at the beginning
                    of the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They made a profit.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I wondered, what the hell is this? As it were, this came to the
                    attention of the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that governed
                    the State Department. The structural situation was such that the only way it
                    could be addressed was externally. He sent a group in from the House survey and
                    investigations group, which is a group available to the entire appropriations
                    committee in the House from the FBI and from the GAO (General Accounting Office)
                    and the Defense Department's contract audit agency. A gentleman by the name of
                    Loft from the FBI and two other guys came over to investigate the books. What
                    they found was there had been created in the Passport Office during Ms. Knight's
                    tenure a “special handling fee.” From the time passports were first created you
                    had a dead period, and then a peak period in the spring when everybody is
                    thinking about going abroad. It is difficult to staff for peaks and valleys.
                    Work in the peak season accumulated. Backlogs are a natural, built-in fact of
                    life. The real management issue was how should you define a backlog and how big
                    should it be because it is always going to be there.</p>
                <p>Well, a scheme had been thought up whereby a special handling fee, an extra
                    charge, would be an elective made available to the applicant during the high
                    season if they wanted the passport on time. What we found further was that
                    Frances Knight had a great publicity activity every year of parading a vast
                    public image that she had been starved of resources and therefore there were all
                    these backlogs and people couldn't travel abroad missing their trains and
                    planes. Of course, when that publicity was out, the attractiveness of her
                    special handling fee became very high.</p>
                <p>What happened is she had been able to create this picture that created so much
                    cash in her communications, telephone and postage account that the inflow of
                    money for special handling more than offset all the expenditures. Of course, the
                    congressional group passed it over to the GAO and the GAO said it was illegal
                    and it has to be terminated. You could not take to a court of law malfeasance in
                    the sense of a connection between the publicity, the imposing of a fee and the
                    offset in the appropriations thereby giving her an unseen amount to use for
                    other purposes. Nobody took the money away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't she have good financial people to tell her that
                        such a fewas against the law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: She had competent staff but you had logic type compartments, the
                    financial guys did financial stuff and management guys did management stuff,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weighed very carefully going into the director and
                        saying,“this ain't legal.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Q: And you had to do it in this way since it couldn't be done by some memo. She
                    had to be confronted. Because if she didn't know what she was doing was illegal,
                    she knew it was self serving.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: In my mind I don't believe the lady had a dumb bone in her body. She
                    was very bright. She modernized the Passport Office, give the devil her due. She
                    created a work environment in which the work got produced. She created a
                    political environment by which she got the resources that she needed. She
                    further created a political climate that preserved her empire and insulated her
                    from meddling above. She viewed anybody who came from above, as meddling. She
                    obviously felt her political strength was such that she could get away with the
                    apparatus for tracking Americans travel abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had links with J. Edger Hoover.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I discovered in my first year in CA on looking at the physical
                    facilities a dozen desks in the Passport Office that I couldn't figure out.
                    These were to accommodate 12 FBI agents who were normally resident in her office
                    for the file information she had. She had the largest colored photographic
                    collection of US citizens that existed because she had a duplicate photo of
                    every person who had ever applied for a passport. She had familiar link
                    information that exceeded anything available elsewhere in the government. When
                    the privacy act came into existence we got rid of them. No agency can go pawing
                    in your file now. It has to be requested, purpose stated, authorized and
                    recorded.</p>
                <p>She saw herself as an integral part of a security apparatus. Don't disregard the
                    title of the bureau - the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>Scott McLeod has a certain reputation in an ideological perspective. He was
                    instrumental in the creation of the bureau with that functional perspective.
                    What you had there was the classic art of the over reach. It never really
                    materialized in any broad way except for what was conjured by Frances or in the
                    visa process. You know the Department has certain links elsewhere on visa
                    clearance issues. Except during that very brief period after the Kennedy
                    election when for gaining control purposes it was seen desirable of putting
                    together all the pieces that had ever been contemplated in the bureau in
                    statute. The bureau was created in statute during the Scott McLeod days long
                    before I ever got there. This was what they had in mind at that time but they
                    couldn't pull it off. Scott McLeod was in the bureau at the time that Frances
                    Knight was appointed. He was never confirmed as the administrator for Consular
                    Affairs. He could not be confirmed. His name was finally withdrawn. He served in
                    an acting capacity. There were a series of two or three appointments there that
                    were very messy and very politicized and ideologically driven. The history of CA
                    leading up to my association was far messier than after I arrived.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I faced an demand that we would open Detroit. It wasn't necessary but it was the
                    cost of getting rid of Frances Knight and they would seriously consider opening
                    two other agencies. Upon her retirement and the ascension of the first
                    non-political type in many years, Lory Lawrence, from the Foreign Service, as
                    head of the Passport Office, we had to carry through with the commitment to open
                    Detroit, which was subsequently closed a few years later when the political heat
                    was off. We created studies and forwarded them to congress about the need for
                    two additional agencies but did not open them. And, with that we will end the
                    career of Frances Knight. She retired and the State Department resumed
                    management of the passport function probably for the first time in 25 years.
                    Between Marge Shipley and Frances Knight, the Passport Office had been more or
                    less untouchable for about a quarter of a century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For obvious political reasons, but also political
                        securitreasons of a right-wing inheritance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That, but I have to be fair to the incumbents, Bill. The State
                    Department managed everything poorly, if it managed at all. It was almost
                    anathema to the profession of most concern to the Foreign Service and, these
                    were production operations. They demanded a totally different style, a different
                    hand at the helm, a little more rigidity, and very service oriented. The State
                    Department would not have given good stewardship anyway, I'm tempted to say. The
                    good stewardship that followed didn't happen by accident. Lory Lawrence, in fact
                    a career senior person, was carefully selected for that position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And succeeded?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Lory succeeded tremendously. What he succeeded in doing was
                    reorienting a Civil Service Passport Office shop, ruled by a tyrant totally
                    outside the sphere of the State Department, and bringing them into the fold.
                    Whether it was more efficient or not is not something to be argued. What he did
                    was to reorient management and employees and brought them into CA firstly, so
                    that CA for the first time in probably 30 or 40 years and maybe since the Rogers
                    Act, began to function as a bureau sharing resources, staff, management
                    philosophy, and becoming a global looking organization encompassing both US
                    domestic as well as overseas functions. That was a big change.</p>
                <p>Q: This was supported, enthusiastically I presume, with all of the ramifications
                    of management and integration by Barbara Watson. Were you now the deputy
                    director?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Oh, yes, long before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you actually become executive director of the
                        Bureau oConsular Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was about 1971, somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Barbara came on when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: In 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had at least three years of experimentation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Apprenticeship. The change in the management of the Passport Office
                    was not universally embraced. Political forces on the Hill, in particular, were
                    very unhappy at the thought of a “careerist” going into the job. The Foreign
                    Service wasn't universally enthusiastic about the idea of getting into that sort
                    of thing. I think it was accepted primarily on the thesis that it was consular
                    and was therefore not really relevant to other things being done in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or wouldn't use resources that were needed in other
                        areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes, and there were other concerns, too. The Passport Office hiring
                    system was generally to hire people at the base, not as professionals, to train,
                    promote and develop them and finally they became officers and some were damn
                    good. There was no exam entry comparable to the Foreign Service. The State
                    Department by and large was bifurcated with most serious positions being held by
                    the Foreign Service, domestically and all positions abroad, except Foreign
                    Service National positions. There was no Civil Service assignment abroad at all.
                    There were very few interims, like FSRs, which included security and very
                    specialized activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not even to make them stronger and more experienced
                        througtraining of a sort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: None. From the departmental personnel policy standpoint there were
                    prohibitions. For example, a Foreign Service officer who didn't want to go
                    around the world any more was prohibited from converting into the Civil Service.
                    A Civil Service officer could apply for lateral entry but he wouldn't get it
                    unless he was lucky enough to be a Wristonee or under a Hays program or some
                    special program that was blessed. In the normal run of the mill to and fro year
                    after year a civil servant could not cross the line into the Foreign Service nor
                    could a Foreign Service officer cross the line back into the Civil Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a tremendous need of personnel at the end of World
                        War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Right. And that was what brought the Wristonee program but not the
                    normal Civil Service program. There was one other, but it was very oriented to
                    employees already in the State Department and I can't think of the name of it
                    but it was patterned after the navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Macomber's Mustang program, which I think still
                        existtoday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That was more or less oriented towards staff corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We needed more people but we needed the right people who
                        would bcompetitive for jobs and hopefully for professionalism. And it
                        worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, there is very little continuity over the years itechniques for
                    meeting overseas staffing requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: You went from a Wriston program that was deemed successful and then
                    deemed a failure. After it was deemed a failure, the Department bumped along for
                    a few years and came up with the Hays program which initially was for Foreign
                    Service staff, to recreate a strong Foreign Service staff, recognizing that the
                    broadening of the Foreign Service officer corps to cover consular and
                    administration was really so resisted that it couldn't work. And the Hays
                    program failed because you were creating a two class society.</p>
                <p>I have to tell you that Barbara Watson was dead set against the Hays program. She
                    saw it as parallel to her experience in the black community. You had the water
                    workers and then you had the carriers of water. The carriers of water analogous
                    to blacks were the staff people. Even though this would have given her in the
                    consular corps access to a lot more talent she needed, she did not support the
                    staff conversion program, the Hays program, because it was a two class
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were under instructions to implement it as a
                        StatDepartment executive director.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I was on both sides of the camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, one paid lip service to Caesar and one does in thhalls and
                    behind the doors what one has to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you also were against a two class system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: We have to separate this by time a little bit, Bill. My primary role
                    in flogging the system to get conversions was before coming to CA. It was in the
                    A bureau and M, and that constellation that serviced CA, budget and fiscal,
                    personnel and all that. In that context I had a relationship with the Hays
                    program. When I moved to CA, I was the CA person. My relationship with Wayne
                    Hays and his staff became one primarily of gaining support for consular interest
                    issues, whether it was budgetary or not. Now Wayne Hays was both House
                    administration and foreign affairs committee. So, he was a king pin in congress
                    and he was important for us. My relationship with him had a lot to do with
                    containing and controlling Frances Knight. He became a primary power and
                    influence when it came to doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that dominated all other issues in the beginning, I
                        presume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. So, the issue of staff corps and conversions, etc. in my
                    relationship was a different one. I was more able to carry out I guess policy
                    stands that Barbara would have wanted and that was: “Get us the talent, get them
                    regular. Get me the junior officers. Don't tell me to hire all the spouses.
                    Don't tell me to hire the kids. Don't tell me to hire the DOD overseas families.
                    And, don't get me staff people. Give me FSOs solely.” She did not seek to have
                    Civil Service people excursions, nor did she seek a Mustang kind of thing. She
                    supported the Mustang program primarily as an EEO thing, not as something
                    functionally tied to the consular staffing requirements abroad.</p>
                <p>She recognized what they had to be, to be the most effective in their jobs. They
                    had to be respected in the mission, literate, capable of analyzing issues and
                    drafting, because when she arrived she found as a result of the kinds of
                    staffing patterns that had taken place prior to her arrival, a lot of consular
                    officers, in fairness, were not competitive. They were adequate to stamp a visa
                    or issue a passport, but they couldn't carry on an analytical conversation. They
                    had no local contacts that would be useful to the mission in terms of
                    information gathering or information spreading. They had no public diplomacy
                    sense at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And maybe a chip on their shoulder to a degree where it
                        made iworse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: They tended to isolate themselves. There is no questioabout that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was a mass of people affected by this over
                        severayears, so it wasn't just like turning a clock on and off. No way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That is correct and they were confronted year after year with the
                    proposal that they merge with their brothers and sisters in the admin function,
                    who likewise were seen as pencil counters and bean counters and floor washers,
                    etc. The admin folks had a very low reputation. There was very little movement
                    from admin or consular into any other endeavor in the State Department. There
                    was very little movement to senior management positions except in those fields.
                    There was very little cross over.</p>
                <p>There is another aspect that has to go in the deck and that is that the situation
                    was one in which both the admin folks and the consular folks maximized the use
                    of their own jargon, their own tools, to create a mystic which gave them some
                    prestige and protection from inroads.</p>
                <p>Q: And got maybe better promotions in some ways. I remember Barbara Watson's
                    insistence that in addition to equal or better promotion rates, there be other
                    outside signs of the equality and importance in foreign affairs of consular
                    work.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, that's another discussion. What we had was the entering of an
                    era in which we created a parallel to what is now to be found unconstitutional
                    in the private sector. That is, we approached the idea of quota systems as the
                    only way we could crack the egg, which was, I think, the thinking in the private
                    sector. By looking at the number of senior and mid level positions that were
                    important to the Department and to begin to demand a proportion of those, a
                    specific percentage.</p>
                <p>To be successful we did all kinds of crazy things. We went over to Frances Wilson
                    in the EB bureau, Economic and Commercial Bureau, and said, “Frances, you and we
                    have to fight publicly over a number of these principal officerships and other
                    things in order for either one of us to get a decent bottom line.” So, we
                    engaged in crossed memos and in great conflict in meetings before the
                    authorities could make decisions, thereby carving out a specific piece of the
                    pie for each of us.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, Ron, if you would like to stop this chronological pattern, keeping with
                    personnel and personnel management issues, or do you want to stop and come back
                    to it later in our interview?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Let me come forward in time. There are two things that I think might
                    be worth putting on the record. One is some evolutionary kinds of things in
                    management and the other is a little bit on automation, mechanization process
                    and that sort of thing. They tend to get together later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>When we arrived in CA, as previously mentioned, there was no bureau structure.
                    There was nothing. There was an aftermath of an attempt to dissolve and recreate
                    free standing entities for visa operations, passport operations and what they
                    called federal security operations consisting of federal benefits and service
                    abroad to Americans in trouble. There was no budget entity, no personnel entity,
                    no management philosophThere was nothing. However, what we found is that there
                    was an interest in automation and modern technology that would assist in a vast
                    workload and tremendous accelerations in the increasing amount of workload with
                    the changes in the visa line in 1968, with the increase of travel by Americans
                    abroad and need for passport services and special consular services abroad at
                    the missions.</p>
                <p>As a result when we arrived we found that in the Passport Office we had the most
                    modern technology in the entire State Department. It was punch paper tape,
                    flexawriters, and it connected to the only mainframe computer the State
                    Department had, an IBM 360, that was acquired on the justification of passport
                    name check operations. That was the first mainframe computer acquisition for the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing to do with foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Nothing. Well, I have to tell you that I do consulting work now on
                    information technology. Today, if you are a political officer assigned abroad
                    and are sitting at your desk your tools are essentially as they were 25 years
                    ago. You don't yet have a desktop. You can't consult with a colleague at the
                    next post in creation of a document. There is no collaborative work possible.
                    You can shoot documents physically around, but you can't collaborate in real
                    time as you can domestically here. I work in a work group and we do all of our
                    work at home on documents through the Internet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that security, money or attitude problems as managed by
                        thState Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: All of the above. USIA has a semblance. They are essentially not
                    concerned about security primarily. They are out there being seen and want to be
                    seen.</p>
                <p>Anyway, what we found was that we had a paper punch operation in passports where
                    information was created on a piece of tape with holes in it, and was carried to
                    a machine that produced things automatically. We had the beginning of that sort
                    of thing in the visa operations for name checks where they were poking tapes
                    overseas into a communication terminal that was carrying the message back to
                    this single computer and getting a name check and sending back a response.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We even have that in the Consular Training Segment of the
                        ForeigService Institute as an example of what not to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I saw the flexawriter over there. So, although there wasn't a central
                    management structure, there was a microcosm of work simplification, automation
                    orientation, mechanization sensitivity both in the Visa Office and the Passport
                    Office. But they were not tied together. There was no communication back and
                    forth between the two. There was Frances Knight, and the Foreign Service side
                    didn't concern itself with the other side. The Visa Office was significantly
                    Foreign Service. There was no cross communication. When it was attempted it was
                    stifled. People who showed disloyalty and dealt with the head office, CA, were
                    headless soon if they were in the Passport Office and found to be dealing with
                    the enemy. I had to save more than one senior officer who was found to be
                    dealing with us in the bureau on bureau issues. They were simply PNGed</p>
                <p>We put some [of the Passport Office] in Visa, some in CA and OCS; moved a couple
                    of them outside the bureau entirely because they were very vulnerable to being
                    besmirched by Frances.</p>
                <p>Back to my point. There was an attitude toward mechanization. An attitude towards
                    automation that didn't exist anywhere else in the State Department. That was
                    very refreshing. We continued after the beginning of the reconstitution of the
                    bureau with the separate entities for a period of several years until Frances
                    retired. Upon her retirement we centralized mechanization from Visa and from
                    Passport. And, you know some of the problems that caused. I think you might have
                    been there at the time. There were civil servants who had long been involved in
                    things and developed proprietary attitudes that had to change.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, within the Department there had begun a power center in the
                    Administration's new focus on general automation that had some definitional
                    problems with the work in CA.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: We had significant philosophical problems in the Department to
                    automation as to whether it had to be done all centrally by the central
                    automation shop or whether the functional areas such as CA could create and
                    implement their own programs. That battle is still going on. It will never end.
                    There is really no resolution. There is no one way for this reason, Bill:
                    Applications development can best be done close to the application sight, and
                    that is CA in and visa and passports operations. However, that has to fit into a
                    larger scheme for economy, for integration into a larger entity. The larger
                    entity's requirements have to be built into the applications development
                    process. How do you best assure that that happens? Then you eventually get down
                    to personalities and organizational relationships. There is nothing scientific
                    about it at all. It is getting them to work together. Now you get into power
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And money, too. These are costly.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: These are very costly and CA typically, because of its unique
                    relationship outside the loop of normal congressional links in the State
                    Department, has links to the Senate and House judiciary committees. No other
                    part of the State Departments links to those two committees. I will be very
                    cynical and say no member serving on the Senate or House judiciary committee can
                    go abroad without the hook on the State Department that gives them access to
                    justification to travel abroad. This is very cynical, but I am going to tell you
                    something. Over time it is important. And the same thing is true of
                    staffers.</p>
                <p>One of the things we did early in the game, Bill, and you recall this, was to
                    create the Consular Conference, a kind of traveling road show, in which we would
                    go around the world and take senior staff and technical people to talk about
                    what is happening in headquarters and the field and get them talking together.
                    We always took with us our OMB examiners and our staffers from the Senate and
                    House judiciary committees, and eventually appropriations committees. Now, to do
                    that, sometimes I had to pay the travel of the congressional travelers because
                    their staff budgets would not support the travel. So, we paid their travel for
                    them to come and bring us the message from the Hill. It worked wonders.</p>
                <p>Q: And this was fairly well understood by one and all overseas. They sometimes
                    wondered, because maybe they weren't always told as honestly and as up forward,
                    what the semi-devious reason was for the conference. But, the conferences were
                    indeed were valid. It was a most valid program.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: This was true. There was a tendency overseas to see the value of the
                    conference in terms of what they gained at that level. A better understanding of
                    policy operations and the background of what they had seen happen is helpful and
                    it is hard to measure that. They couldn't see at all the benefit that was gained
                    by entertaining folks from outside the work sphere of the State Department. And,
                    yet, to get the budgets we had to have, to get support on legislation, it was
                    important for these people to understand that the folks out there needed their
                    support. It seemed to work.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>There was a symbioses involved in the process. We had created what later became
                    known as the Consular Package, and we will talk about that in specific terms,
                    which included a raft of statistical analytical information which depicted
                    workloads, processes, staffing and other resource related items post by post,
                    mission by mission, worldwide. The use of that accumulated information, analysis
                    based thereon and global statistical summaries depended upon credibility. To a
                    great extent we gained credibility for that product by having the users, the
                    consumers were really not us although they helped us do the analytical work, but
                    the marketing use of the tool was even more important. That demanded
                    credibility. By taking the OMB staffers, having committee staffers from
                    appropriations, foreign relations and judiciary committees out, to hear us talk
                    about how vital it was that it be accurate and not be fluff, that the numbers be
                    sound, vetted and staffed throughout the embassy and the posts so that everybody
                    was on the same sheet of paper. They became more and more impressed. These were
                    credible documents, credible requirements and they needed to have appropriations
                    support.</p>
                <p>Q: And none of the consular sections, like many government agencies, needed money
                    for weapons, etc., but in fact needed resources to serve people. People,
                    constituents, getting passports, getting visas for relatives to come to the U.S.
                    All real-life, vote related, appropriated resources.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That's right. It brought them up against the only portion of a 25,000
                    person institution that costs $5 billion a year that directly touches them and
                    their constituents. By advertising the fee collections and the amount we put
                    into the Treasury, it became less painful for them to appropriate the money
                    because they could show their colleagues an offset which was an income to the
                    Treasury.</p>
                <p>We exercised good stewardship in increasing those fee levels which had not been
                    done before. When we arrived, we found the fee income was far less than costs.
                    Working with OMB directly we developed a system to analyze services in terms of
                    costs, increase fee schedules close to cost recovery, which again supported OMB
                    and the appropriating committees in having to come to give us more money. It
                    convinced them that we had costed and covered all the fees and all the costs we
                    could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In language and style that they understood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Bill, we even gave them clearance on the schemes before we issued
                    them, partially for ego reasons and partially for involvement reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, you knew it was going to be a great success.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, we knew that when we changed fees we were going to have great
                    public outcry. We doubled the IV, immigrant visa, fees two and a half times and
                    we were accused of subverting CSCE (Council on Security and Cooperation in
                    Europe) by Larry Eagleburger because we had done something that prohibited the
                    free crossing of international borders and he held us up for one year.</p>
                <p>Q: It was constitutionally required. Those immigrants had the right to this visa,
                    why should they pay for it. I said this to Barbara Watson one day.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: You did?</p>
                <p>Increasing that fee, by and large, did more for us on the Hill and OMB than any
                    other fee change we made, because these were immigrants. Other fees, that
                    affected American citizens, caused a little different attitude. Anyway, Larry
                    Eagleburger was assistant secretary for EUR and he prevented us for one whole
                    year from implementation of alleged allegations that this subverted CSCE. Now,
                    who is right? I can't say. That was a damn important treaty in those days and we
                    were the advocates of it.</p>
                <p>In any event, the system that we had developed for placing fees more closely in
                    alignment with actual costs was such that OMB asked us to teach INS how to do
                    it, because INS was collecting very little money [for the services it gave].. We
                    tried our best, sending our guys over to talk to them, but they got no where.
                    INS for another 15 years charged token fees and saw no value in cooperating with
                    OMB and the congress in collecting fees and forewent the opportunities that we
                    seized on in building goodwill and convincing the congress of good stewardship
                    and giving them something that they could use for their colleagues to get them
                    to stop bitching about giving the State Department an extra $20 million for
                    automation for consular operations. They are paying it back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you bring us up to date as to whether the INS fee
                        ianywhere near costs today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: INS, after being beaten over the head year after year after year,
                    finally did institute a new fee program maybe a decade ago now, about the time I
                    retired. They did it, however, by bum-set.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: They sat on their bums and used manpower utilization data derived for
                    budgetary and other purposes and did a little sampling and used it to support a
                    theory on costs that in turn produced a fee schedule. It looked fine from the
                    outside because it was an increase. However, anyone who has watched the results
                    over the decade has seen them get into deep, deep, deep political, legal - and
                    in one case criminal - trouble, because once having collected the fees they
                    misutilized them. This was in contrast to the State Department where the fees
                    collected all went to Treasury as miscellaneous receipts and recorded as income
                    for the US government which we could show as an off set. They achieved statutory
                    authority to retain certain fees and they had such a weak internal management
                    control system that they couldn't control where the money was going. And we went
                    into legalization, you remember that one. Funds that were collected for
                    legalization were supposed to be used only for that purpose. But they ended up
                    buying vehicles with them. I don't believe it was ever proven to be stealing of
                    funds. Rather it was a mis-accounting, misuse and abuse. I believe someone went
                    to jail because of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we ever change our system of turning over all the fee
                        fundto the Treasury?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: During my time in CA, Bill, I was encouraged by some to do two
                    things. One was to centralize global consular resources in an earmarked
                    appropriations context, in CA, which CA would then dole out to the posts or
                    geographic bureaus in terms of operations dollars, salary dollars, FTE
                    positions, staff, etc. The other was to come up with a scheme that would permit
                    us to have direct access to fees collected. Instead of them going to the
                    Treasury, the fee receipts would be retained by the State Department.</p>
                <p>I resisted that, however, for about 15 years. The reason I did was that I felt
                    the success of consular operations abroad required integration with the mission.
                    The minute you make a reservation of resources, you are outside the loop. You
                    are no longer important. You are no longer considered. If you have overloads as
                    we had highly seasonal workloads, you can't call upon the mission for shot
                    infusions of resources. You can't detail staff across from other sections. You
                    begin to see the loss of even junior officer assignments. The plain fact of life
                    is you cannot operate a post from Washington. You cannot do it. The post
                    administration has got to be local. So, I resisted the idea of centralization
                    and earmarking into CA.</p>
                <p>We came out of S&amp;E [salary and expenses], which is the generic appropriation
                    for the State Department. We competed within the mission then for a proper
                    allocation and we used all kinds of things to do that. Leadership support from
                    the Hill or OMB or support internally or getting prominent folks up topside. We
                    had Barbara Watson, a prominent black female, who could only be bruised so much
                    because she had unique qualities.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The accounting for fees as a trust in the State Department, versus going to
                    Treasury, I resisted also. I felt that in fact if we did that, we would be taken
                    out of the appropriation and wouldn't be appropriating but living on fees. Fees,
                    certainly for visas and passports, are variable over time. You may say, “Yes,
                    but they have gone up traditionally,” and they have. But travel patterns change
                    with world economic conditions, currency exchange rates due to terrorism, etc.
                    There are all kinds of things that caused changes in the rates of travel, and
                    there was income derived from passports and visas. We had constant costs. We had
                    base costs. If we went into a fee based support system and we went into the
                    overloads, we would have no place to go.</p>
                <p>Q: And you would have to prove that the price spent was the following....</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: We could only change income by price. So, we continued to depend upon
                    on specific appropriation for the State Department as a budget base. About five
                    years ago they needed money to implement a machine readable visa world wide
                    which would take a significant automation investment. There was no real hope of
                    getting an appropriations increase to support it at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they need that by legislation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, they needed the money. In order to get the money they came up
                    with a proposal which essentially assured congress that the monies flowing into
                    miscellaneous receipts would continue unabated, unaffected by the change that
                    was going to be proposed. Therefore, Treasury could project this as a source of
                    income to the government. They convinced congress that it was appropriate
                    because of the increased cost for the machinery of the visa to charge the visa
                    applicant an additional amount for that machine readable visa, which gave the
                    visa applicant, the future user, certain benefits. These included being able to
                    get through custom checks and border checks routinely and more quickly. It gave
                    us all kinds of benefits, but it gave them benefits too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was security the principal benefit, the driving
                        force?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: There was a package of beneficiaries. The system was a beneficiary in
                    the sense that the labor required to produce the machine readable visa was not
                    to exceed the labor required to produce a routine visa. The security
                    enhancements were a plus, in terms of internal vulnerabilities, fraud
                    perpetrated by officers or Foreign Service nationals, which has always been
                    there although not talked about much. It is a serious concern in a number of
                    parts of the world. We have found at times the whole visa section to be
                    culpable. External control in terms of the inviolability of the visa once put
                    into the foreign passport. Border control points could more readily determine
                    when there had been manipulation, changed visas, substituted pictures, etc. The
                    fields that were automated were more assuredly read by automatic readers at the
                    ports of entry in terms of getting clearance as a person came through. There
                    were many beneficiaries. I think the driving point was security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And don't forget the word that goes with it,
                        terrorism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Terrorism, yes. Well, this was ongoing. We had a little problem with
                    the sheik in an African country being issued a visa....</p>
                <p>In this same time frame, because of those external drivers, you began to get
                    money appropriated with the FBI for the creation of the first automatic
                    fingerprint system. This was contemplated in the machine readable visa because
                    it was anticipated that eventually the machine readable visa would be tied into
                    an automatic data base that the FBI had just begun to develop. Now, it took
                    about seven or eight years for the FBI to finish its work. It is now in
                    operation.</p>
                <p>We are now running fingerprints from the missions into the automated data base.
                    We are designing systems now that will electronically transmit the fingerprint
                    as a part of the lookup system. That is being done in Mexico as a pilot
                    test.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have come now in your interview to the point of
                        present-daknowledge and sophistication that we have reached, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, yes. Technology has emerged that will make that possible in a
                    cost-effective manner. You have been able to do it for years and has been done
                    in Los Alamos and Sandy and places like that where they read the iris of the
                    eyeball, the fingerprint, and do all kinds of interesting things. Today, because
                    the cost of technology is down, money it is no longer an issue. We also had the
                    problem Mexico followers are well aware of: the millions and millions and
                    millions of border crossing cards. You can't eyeball a document. You can
                    electronically process a document and get a fingerprint check immediately, but
                    you can't do much beyond that. The traffic queues now will line up for hours and
                    hours. Now, with NAFTA ( North American Free Trade Agreement) you have trucks
                    and vehicle traffic like you have never had before, and you have to be able to
                    get them through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you can't issue pre-clearances like you do for
                        airplanes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Right. We convinced congress that while not reducing the fee income
                    projected by Treasury for consular operations, we could fairly establish a new
                    fee for the machine readable passport even though by treaty we agree with
                    foreign countries to waive non-immigrant fees bilaterally. We have done this
                    with practically every country in the world. We could implement a machine
                    readable document without violating those treaties, without reducing the flow of
                    money to the Treasury, because it was a fee that had not been charged before,
                    and that the sums we could charge that legitimately related to cost would in
                    turn support the cost of the automation going into it.</p>
                <p>We would not collect money for American salaries and permanent costs and
                    buildings. We would collect money associated with automation of the process.
                    That was the camel's nose under the tent. Congress agreed. Machine readable visa
                    fees are collected, deposited to Treasury, credited to a trust account in the
                    State Department and available for general support, with some specific
                    earmarking for visa automation. So, we have now access to fees very
                    specifically, very pointedly, under very controlled conditions, using accounting
                    systems that account for their stewardship and operating under an annual
                    stewardship report to congress, which is how we keep the system honest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And not questioned on the Hill anymore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: As a matter of fact it has worked so well that a new fee was
                    established for domestic passport operations for expedited services. If you now
                    go to a passport agency and apply for a passport you are going to pay, I think,
                    $45. If you want to pay an extra $25 or $35 you can have a guarantee that you
                    will get your passport in 24 hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was attacked on television the other night.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I'm sure it will be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Why should I have to pay for a service like that,
                        that I aalready paying for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: You have opened a can of worms. Let me digress. In the first part of
                    our interview I mentioned a special handling fee that Frances Knight had
                    instituted which gave her access to money. There are elements of the
                    reconstitution of the special handling fee in the fee that is now charged for
                    special services. Back in time I had an analysis done, including review by the
                    GAO and by the survey and investigation group of the House appropriations
                    committee, of the relationship between increased cost and rapid service. We
                    found the difference to be less then 50 cents. We documented the fact that the
                    operating procedures of the Passport Office were such that uniformly, whether or
                    not a person had paid an extra fee when backlogs occurred, the first procedure
                    upon opening the mail was to see the departure date of the traveler and if the
                    departure date was within ten days it was automatically slipped to the front of
                    the line. The State Department continued that practice because it makes sense.
                    So, I have great difficulty seeing the basis for a $35 fee for special handling,
                    although I have not seen any numbers. In any event, that fee was established and
                    it is now a source of income and the funds are available.</p>
                <p>The first two years' income was substantially dedicated to the Passport Office
                    automation to come up with a new passport. The funds otherwise flow into a
                    capital improvement fund for information and technology support in the
                    department across the board, as do the machine readable visa fees. So, now there
                    are two fees, the funds of which are retained by the State Department. They are
                    re-authorized every year. They are appropriated from the trust fund not Treasury
                    receipts. So, the same congressional oversight is there. It is just that they
                    are not drawn from generic Treasury funds. Now, it gave the department an
                    infusion of cash which it otherwise would not be able to get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it is a service-oriented fee, which we
                        understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: There is nothing wrong with this as long as the stewardship in
                    accounting and utilization is vigilant, not like INS. I think as long as the
                    judiciary committees are involved in the oversight, and the authorizing and
                    appropriations committees continue to demand their reports, it won't be
                    distorted.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Q: Does the oversight take care of intervention? Let's face it, it is often
                    somebody doing a favor for a constituent, or the consul general taking care of
                    that call from the president, via the ambassador. That type of intervention
                    often settles all emergency cases, or most of them. But, now that you have a fee
                    that you can tell the person, “Well, if you pay $35 more that will take care of
                    the intervention....” Or doesn't that exist?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I think probably the existence of the passport expedite fee is of
                    value to congressional service staffers because the applicant is shown right at
                    the time of application that there is a way you can be sure,. “Here it is, pay
                    your money.” As long as Passport delivers on that, it is better for congress
                    because they get fewer calls.</p>
                <p>There is another aspect of fees perhaps worth documenting that is going on now
                    and that is in the passport context. Because telephone workloads are terribly
                    consuming, because they are a constant source of irritation to the public, there
                    is no way without going to free 800 numbers that you can stack the calls
                    properly. Social Security attempted to do that with free lines and ended up
                    spending several hundred million dollars a year and had a devil of a time
                    getting away from it. In the passport context, a contractor was engaged to
                    develop a system of an automated telephone tree response pattern responding to
                    the most frequently asked questions. In addition, a contractor was engaged to
                    handle the telephone calls that were in person queries. A differential fee was
                    established. The in-person queries now, if you call the line, you will pay $1.05
                    a minute, for talking to someone about where is my passport, etc. You will pay
                    35 cents a minute to call into the telephone tree and play with the computer by
                    pushing such-and-such a number.</p>
                <p>Both of those systems have generated a lot of controversy. The response at the
                    State Department has been, “Okay, if this is unacceptable, congress, give us 500
                    positions and $50 million and we will recreate what we had before; that is,
                    staff to handle the telephones. Those people are now issuing passports. If you
                    want us to do that, that is fine with us, but you have to give us the money
                    first.” And, of course, congress is not in the mood to give away money. So,
                    despite a lot of complaints and a number of the public feeling they are being
                    ripped off, the system is in place and the proceeds are maintained. Now, the
                    proceeds generally only pay for the cost of that service. It is a service,
                    however, that was paid out of an appropriated base up until the system was
                    designed and implemented, so it released funds for other things. It also does
                    another thing. It keeps disruptions from coming into passport agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to presume that a lot of what you have done, and
                        had tdo, was in reaction to something that happened in the real world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: There is no question about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Q: Would you say that most of those things that you have singled out,
                    particularly reacting with the computer, reacting with modernization of an
                    automated system of some sort, was more to advance planning on your part, or
                    events that just took place?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Both. It is difficult to get funds on theories. You need to be able
                    to develop a describable need that can be used to justify the acquisition of
                    anything that costs money. So, there has to be something happening out there,
                    not just a theory of something happening, in my experience, before OMB and
                    congress will respond. There are 20 other demands for that money.</p>
                <p>We are going to need to address the internal management philosophies of the State
                    Department in relation to funding and staffing because the battles that we
                    fought were more severe internally than they were externally.</p>
                <p>Q: I sense that management issues you faced were quite different than your
                    successors face and they have a different base from which they now work. No one,
                    I would argue, “internally” cared much about a consular package. If, I'm right,
                    all those things came from you and the few others that thought that way.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: As I said when I arrived there was no base for anything. There was
                    very little knowledge base by resources and what was being consumed. They were
                    all buried in the budgets of geographic bureaus and posts and various places.
                    The competition internally, within the State Department, was such that we had a
                    very difficult time pressing our needs successfully. Consular issues are
                    generally not of great importance to a cabinet officer, unless they get him in
                    trouble. Unless there is an American in a Mexican jail being tortured. Unless
                    there is a constituent has a visa applicant who can't get a visa or a refugee
                    who got kicked out or a passport that didn't get issued, they didn't give a
                    darn. As a result the consular activity was doing less well than necessary to
                    support the functions.</p>
                <p>In looking at the internal situation it became quite apparent that no matter what
                    we did, dealing solely internally wouldn't make a great deal of difference. Even
                    if we were able to generate increased appropriations flow, the commissions that
                    were paid on that increased flow were very severe. Very little ended up at the
                    trickle down level where the rubber meets the road. Even if it was appropriated
                    as an increase in good faith, and was distributed by the Department to the
                    geographic bureaus and down to the missions, the mission demands were such that
                    distortions occurred there. In casting about for a product that has credibility,
                    provides an analytical tool to ourselves, because frankly we didn't have the
                    foggiest idea of whether Mexico had too many or too few resources, we had no
                    knowledge of what procedural flow was in place in Mexico City versus Paris.
                    There was little procedural control, little constancy, little sharing across
                    line, except as an assigned officer went from post to post and they could be
                    very capricious because what they remembered was often not the same kind of
                    case. So, you had disruptions caused by assignment change which were aided and
                    abetted by the lack of a firm procedural milieu.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>There was an officer who had no concept of how to engineer workload, analyze
                    workload, project workload, lead workload, develop proper work habits among
                    staff, etc. As we cast about we began to think about a scheme that would permit
                    us to go globally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is we in this case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Probably yours truly and a particular analyst at OMB. We got together
                    and talked about how can we systematically portray what is going on in a way
                    that will influence all the people who have a vote in the process. And that
                    begins at the embassy or post and runs up through the assistant secretaries and
                    cabinet level, the comptroller, OMB and congress. We began thinking about a
                    packaging that would reflect something about each post. The best account item we
                    had was the fee schedule. It didn't represent necessarily clean cleavages in the
                    work but what it was was an accepted enumeration of tasks that were supported by
                    allocations of fees. Whether or not those allocations were correct, which they
                    weren't when we came on board, was less relevant than that they had credibility
                    externally. They had been alluded to as being accurate. They supported the
                    thesis to give them money because their money is coming into the Treasury,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>So, we started basically with items contained in the Foreign Service consular fee
                    list. We began to try to associate work effort with those tasks. What is
                    consumed to produce it. This tied in with our refinement of the consular fee
                    schedule because that became the basis of the consular package. We had to be
                    more accurate or we couldn't use it for analytical purposes. We thought we
                    couldn't do this from Washington and came up with a scheme that involves the
                    consular officer, who knows conditions, what it takes to produce a visa, and it
                    is different in every post. Even if we make it procedurally parallel, the
                    conditions, economically, societal, political, environmental, work, staff, etc.
                    that what it takes to produce a particular item will vary greatly even within
                    country.</p>
                <p>So, what we set about to do was to come up with a scheme that would permit us to
                    depict the primary consumers of resources, beginning with the fee schedule, and
                    after a year moving beyond that to things that were more clearly accountable and
                    meant something. There were a number of items in the fee schedule that meant
                    nothing in terms of manpower. We evolved from something that began looking from
                    the first enumeration of task, the fee schedule, to an enumeration of tasks
                    representing a product. It might be a jail visit, correspondence, visas issued
                    or denied, etc. We associated these with work hours. We came up with a
                    structural package.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that we were involved in managerial devolution before it
                    became popular because we involved the consular officer at his desk in a process
                    of a re- orientation of how to look at work, at workload, at staff, programming
                    of the day's activities, the rhythm of staffing requirements, etc.</p>
                <p>We began to use the consular officer as a local manager, not just as a guy
                    banging out visas. We required that he involve his admin counselor and his DCM
                    in the process of validating what he anticipated, what he had done and what he
                    foresees for the future. This gave us a way around a real hard nut in the
                    Foreign Service. That is, the average tour abroad is three years or less. The
                    first year is spent settling in, the second year is spent working and the third
                    year is spent looking for the next assignment, when interest begins to wane.</p>
                <p>There was very inadequate bridging from manager to manager, stylistically, policy
                    wise, their understanding of the tools of the trade. There was very little
                    continuity at post. By using the kind of a system that we came up with for
                    looking at work and assessing work and projecting work based on past experience
                    and current events, we were beginning to create a bridge so that the transition
                    from manager to manager became less traumatic and workload proceeded less
                    encumbered by idiotic change and more encumbered by consistency.</p>
                <p>I think this was better understood, even by the local work force who participated
                    in many cases in the workload analysis. I think the approach facilitated
                    re-engineering efforts which you now call re-engineering and that is dissecting
                    tasks into components and trying to figure out where they work and in what
                    sequence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It tells the manager quite a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, it gave them a way to look at the job that I think perhaps was
                    not as much in his mind before. As we developed this package of methodology
                    reviewing the tasks, the tools it took to produce the tasks, we began to show
                    high top support for the process. We began to communicate the credibility that
                    must be included within top management at State. The competition for resources
                    in the State Department had been such that the consular activity was always a
                    pain in the neck to top management. And, top management could never be confident
                    that the investments that they were making made a difference. Top management in
                    many cases had a view of the consular manager of being an idiot who didn't
                    really know what he wanted. He didn't understand it.</p>
                <p>And, in many cases they were right. These were not managers, these were technical
                    guys who were damn good at adjudicating a visa, at taking care of problems with
                    local authorities, but couldn't manage worth a dime because they had never been
                    taught. Never been given the tools or orientated to how to look at work, not as
                    a curse but something that was there that you engineer and worked with.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Barbara use this device?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: The first use of the device was internally because through the
                    creation and initial implementation of the device we involved the department,
                    the geographic bureaus and posts as well as the comptroller and Personnel Office
                    in a process of inspection and examination and a production of data that
                    reflected, for better or for worse, what was going on. It helped the Comptroller
                    to provide us the resources we needed, but his problem was satisfying many
                    customers. It gained us a better understanding, beginning with the counselor for
                    administration at the embassy level in the mission. We required the DCM to sign
                    off on the package so we made sure at least he knew the words and had some
                    accountability. So, the benefits initially were obtained within the State
                    Department, not externally.</p>
                <p>Now, when it came to packaging the State Department's annual budget and getting
                    it through the review processes at OMB, we had by the time it reached OMB
                    coopted them into the process of the design of the tool, the initial operation
                    of the tool, the analytical techniques applied to the tool and good exposure to
                    our stewardship to making sure that the alleged credibility was reasonable.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any other element in the department that was using anything
                    comparable?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: No. It was pretty primitive. For 20 years the consular package was
                    the only systematic compilation in which you could look backward and forward.
                    The only one in which there was routinely required the participation at the
                    operating level at the post in workload analysis, anticipation and forecasting,
                    etc. It wasn't universally embraced, Bill. Many people in the field fought like
                    hell.</p>
                <p>Then we got into semi-annual and quarterly updates. We were lucky because the
                    Visa Office had always had statistical reporting of a certain kind, so we just
                    snuck in and wrote on what was already there and accepted in the visa context.
                    Over the years we began to flesh it out a little more and a little more. We had
                    battles with the Visa Office because we were corrupting their reporting. They
                    had to have this reporting in a certain way and at a certain time and it
                    couldn't be adjusted because it would violate the law or abrogate the intent of
                    the law. It was a sacred sort of thing. But, this served the purpose of letting
                    us go beyond an annual compilation to a validation technique. It never hurts to
                    let the client know out there that it isn't the next guy who arrives a year
                    later that is going to have to account for it, he is going to account for
                    something every four months.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>To digress a moment, you have to understand the cycling of the process a little
                    bit. A workload analysis budget forecast is inherently old by the time you are
                    saying it is the truth. When you begin the process you are at least eight months
                    from the conclusion of a fiscal year that you are going to say was fact. You are
                    going to report that three things were done in that year. Well, hell, the year
                    is only one-fourth over when you are beginning to say that. Then you are going
                    to say that this year we are going to do something with a certain volume of work
                    that is so far down the road but by the time you are sending it to congress it
                    is old. Not only is it old, but the real facts of the prior year's activities
                    become known and if they are in variance with what you are sending forward, the
                    starting point of everything you have calculated is wrong.</p>
                <p>We got into a periodic updating of the process in order that when we went to OMB,
                    before it resulted in a president's budget in January, we had valid information.
                    We would go in and say, “Okay, you got the forecast and here we stand in the
                    validating update in between.” Sometimes it would be denied, but usually it
                    confirmed. If it didn't confirm we threw it in the waste basket.</p>
                <p>Now, this got us through the State Department process because they were no longer
                    competing against fluff. They were looking at things that were alleged to be
                    rather firm, rather precise, they were measurable. There were predictable
                    consequences if you ignored them. More importantly, the guys outside, the guys
                    that we had recruited from the congress and those from OMB, were saying, “What
                    does the package say? Tell us what the analysis shows.” So we created the
                    external force that caused the State Department to say, “We support it,” because
                    we coupled the external support with not too heavily veiled threats from
                    external realities to earmark appropriations if the State Department didn't come
                    up with a scheme to probably depict the consular requirement.</p>
                <p>And, of course, if there was anything the Department didn't want, it was an
                    earmarking of the appropriations, and properly so. They needed the flexibility
                    to use money where they needed it. But, without those kind of potential threats
                    in mind, we wouldn't have gotten the kind of support that we did.</p>
                <p>Q: Ron, as you talk through the consular package, one element that you have not
                    included - maybe because it isn't as numbers-oriented as visas and passports -
                    is protection of Americans and general services to Americans, such as federal
                    benefits. All of these are very sensitive and very costly. How did that
                    fare?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: We leaned more on verbal analysis in protection and welfare and
                    services to Americans. That is, descriptions of conditions in local jails, the
                    amount of narcotic activity that was going on, and local conditions that made a
                    difference. If a protection and welfare case in one environment took 50 times as
                    long as somewhere else we could handle that in a text because we had both a text
                    and numbers. In the special consular stuff generally we did not publish it
                    externally, a raft of statistical data. That was better addressed in a narrative
                    context.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We produced “Warnings to Americans.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: We had that. But, the end product was an overlay globally, a summary
                    geographic bureau by geographic bureau, a summary country by country, and under
                    that was a serious document on each post. The entire compendium was perhaps two
                    or three inches. Now you could live with the summary of maybe two dozen pages or
                    you had a compendium in a full book. We made sure that the full book got to the
                    Hill, to the staffers and to OMB, even though officially they got summaries. In
                    the detail sheet for each post you will not find a lot of narrative typically
                    talking about things that justify themselves statistically, visas and passports
                    generally. Your text is more devoted to the softer things that can't be quite as
                    quantified.</p>
                <p>Q: Such as hostage taking, the shooting down of airplanes with Americans on them,
                    things that made the paper and are pretty explicit in terms of services.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Exactly. We would publish the number of guys in jail, increases in
                    arrest rates, etc. During this time, remember, other things are happening to
                    reduce the significant impact of certain kinds of activity. We negotiated
                    bilateral treaties with most of the countries of the world now in which we
                    exchange prisoners. We agreed that a Russian who is convicted in New York will
                    be sent back to Russia to serve his time and they agree that Americans convicted
                    in Moscow will come back here to serve their time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even a Frenchman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Even a Frenchman. And so we have reduced some of thosworkloads by
                    other arrangements.</p>
                <p>Now the package became useful for all sorts of things. When an ambassador went to
                    post he got this stuff as part of his orientation. When a principal officer went
                    out he came around and got the stuff. It was useful in briefing people on the
                    Hill who were going abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is it today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I think it plays the same role in that it is part of an environment
                    in which a consular manager is taught from the beginning that he has a
                    responsibility to analyze his processes, not merely arrive and do work. He has
                    to project, attempt to re-engineer, learn how to play within the bureaucratic
                    enterprise. When we arrived consular officers didn't know how to articulate what
                    it was they needed. And, when they could articulate it they didn't know where to
                    do it. The concept of building friends for future need, the symbioses of a
                    bureaucratic enterprise was there, but it was: 'I will trade you a visa for
                    something else'.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That still happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, I can't really say. The idea that an entire work style,
                    however, that involves visiting the counselor for administration, and finding
                    out where you can help him, and visiting other members of the mission. There is
                    a time to pay back and you enlist the support. So, the package is still a part
                    of [managing a consular operation]. It encourages an attitude, way to approach
                    work, way to approach [colleagues]. It inculcates a better feeling; if I
                    articulate it properly they are going to respond. Now, we all know in resource
                    allocation there is favoritism. You go from post to post and one is working real
                    hard and one is losing, apparently. I think the consular managers have a
                    stronger feeling that there is less of that. So I think it kind of infuses the
                    entire consular operations.</p>
                <p>Q: It didn't go away, it got stronger and was actually mimicked. The two people
                    who led it, you and Barbara Watson, as the first ones at it, have been
                    substantiated. Management continues the same forever there after. Or put another
                    way, does the leader of Consular Affairs now take the exact same positive
                    attitude?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: The only diminution was, I believe, a particular political appointee
                    whose fate in a bureau was very bad, who left under a black cloud, whose
                    interests had nothing at all to do with...</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is September 28, 1999. We are in the middle of talking about some of the
                    successors to Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, Barbara Watson,
                    in terms of whether they were supportive or not, and to what degree. of the
                    Consular Package.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I was talking about one particular assistant secretary who was not
                    destructive but just totally uninvolved. The result of being uninvolved is that
                    you conduct yourself at hearings and various activities in which you know
                    nothing about the process, allude to nothing authoritative, thereby diminish the
                    support that had been built for a process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, even worse, talked at length about the poor service
                        CA waproviding American citizens, under certain conditions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I have heard about that. But, the immediate successor to Barbara
                    Watson, Lenny Walentynowicz, a lawyer from Buffalo, had never had a significant
                    managerial job before joining the bureau. He was significantly driven
                    ideologically on immigration matters. He came on board and showed himself an
                    able student of the managerial processes that we had instituted and soon learned
                    that their external credibility meant that they would be useful to him in terms
                    of maintaining a resource base and a carefully crafted reputation of adequate
                    performance, thereby letting him pursue things that were of more interest to
                    himself.</p>
                <p>He became actively involved internally in advancing the interest of an analytical
                    approach to work analysis and resource planning. He carried that through OMB. He
                    comported himself well and learned the material he needed to learn for hearings
                    and under his direction the process was strengthened. It continued to provide
                    the department and congress and the public with all the benefits that had been
                    envisaged at its creation. He had the political sensitivity to understand the
                    value of continuing to involve congress and OMB in the process in context
                    elaboration of the process and reenforcement of the process. He was very
                    supportive.</p>
                <p>Following Walentynowicz we had the return of Barbara Watson for a period, and she
                    continued her solid support, advancing the interests of the consular corps as an
                    integrated professional organization.</p>
                <p>Upon her departure, Diego Asencio came on board as the first senior FSO, as far
                    as I can recall, to head the Bureau of Consular Affairs. He actively,
                    energetically, visibly supported any process that could advance the Department's
                    interest in supporting Consular Affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: Including being certain that consular officers had arrived in full competition
                    for promotion and equality with all Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: True, and there is an interesting evolution there Bill. With Barbara
                    Watson you had a background that experienced discrimination from birth. So, you
                    had very strong drives to equalize and the boot strap to bring a mistreated, in
                    her eyes, abused and unappreciated group, to full equality. Now, she was also
                    active in promoting the EEO agenda, probably more ethnically and racially than
                    sexually, but she was there and very much involved in the processes in the
                    Department and externally that had advanced the cause of EEO.</p>
                <p>She had been followed in her first “appearance” by the fellow from Buffalo who
                    was ethnically Polish, who had a number of the stereo typical views that might
                    be expected. He had a feeling that quota kinds of approaches to handling
                    disadvantaged groups was wrong, but he recognized that they were there and he
                    fought hard internally for the rights of the consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The famous third generation, if you will.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. He had an analogist perspective but it was ethnically based.
                    After Barbara's second “appearance” Diego Asencio was the most senior Hispanic
                    in the Department. He had some elements of perspective that were influenced by
                    that. He felt that the time had arrived that consular officers should be able to
                    hold their heads as high as anyone. That they should secure a full measure of
                    assignments to the attractive positions, should aspire to become ambassadors,
                    etc. Now, these are not significantly different than Barbara Watson's, but he
                    was serving in a different time frame. He could look upon a group that was more
                    qualified. It had been enriched over a period of time. It had gained respect. I
                    guess consular officers picked up the baton and carried it proudly.</p>
                <p>Diego, probably stylistically and personality-wise, had the strongest assets of
                    any of the assistant secretaries I served with. He could captivate an audience
                    bent on his destruction. He knew how to disarm them, how to massage their egos
                    and was canny enough to discern ahead of time what they needed and wanted, and
                    led them to believe that they would receive a reasonable measure of what they
                    needed.</p>
                <p>He continued the same battles internally, however, he had a modicum of success in
                    some ways significantly greater than Barbara Watson's or Lenny Walentynowicz's
                    in that he was of the cloth. He was successful as a Foreign Service officer and
                    had been an ambassador. He was highly regarded as a political officer even
                    though, he, as Barbara Watson, became a super consular officer. He never
                    addressed himself to the substance of consular work, to become an expert in it
                    like a lawyer would be, and as Barbara Watson did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as Walentynowicz did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, she had a more scholarly approach. Lenny, I think, had a more
                    ideologically driven perspective. Diego's great mission was to preside over the
                    reintegration of the Passport Office into the State Department and into the
                    consular management totality. He presided over Lory Lawrence's assignment,
                    succeeding Frances Knight. He had a style in reorganizing the bureau at that
                    time that led to very heavy employee involvement all the way down to the desk,
                    to the clerk. There were working groups and endless discussions. This was a very
                    brilliant bureaucratic tactic and encouraged cross talk. It opened up cross
                    assignment potential. It raised horizons. Within six months the bureau was
                    thinking and being perceived as a bureau, as an entity.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>He was able to create an environment that better met the aspirations of
                    particularly the non-involved passport folks, but also across the bureau. He
                    created certain centralized amalgams that facilitated the creation as a whole.
                    He centralized automation kinds of activities, and planning activities, and
                    anti-fraud activities, and policy activities, and public affairs activities. He
                    brought people from the constituent pieces into those centralized entities which
                    gave them a stake in a larger bureau view. Now, some of those perhaps later were
                    devolved back down to a lower level, nevertheless they continued to maintain a
                    central tie and a cordial relationship. So, Diego presided over a new era in the
                    bureau and a new era congressionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had friends in congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: He and the chairman of the House Foreign RelationCommittee were very
                    close personal friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also had something else in his credentials which you
                        failed tre-mention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: What was that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been a prisoner of a terrorist group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes, he had two unique qualifications. His first assignment was as a
                    consular officer in the Yucatan peninsula and he had visited jails himself.
                    Subsequently, as ambassador to Bogota, Colombia, he had been a captive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And managed it brilliantly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes, and he wrote a book about it. It was on the plane returning
                    after his release that he was told he was going to be assigned as assistant
                    secretary for Consular Affairs. And, to his credit he didn't run the other way.
                    He carried on a liaison with the Mexican government in terms of consular issues,
                    the likes of which had never been seen before or since. We created a cross
                    border working group tantamount to being a commission and created new border
                    crossing documents. He was able to accept some of the things the Mexicans felt
                    essential to accept for political or other reasons. He knew them and respected
                    them and they felt better. He had probably the strongest innate leadership
                    skills of any assistant secretary, in fact, almost anyone I worked with my
                    entire career.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I have to add that he was not universally loved. This is not a god figure. But,
                    from the standpoint of being a leader and involving people in the processes that
                    will affect them, his philosophy and approach were carried out very
                    effectively.</p>
                <p>Q: As we near the end of our discussion you have given us sort of a rundown of
                    our leaders, which is vital. You have given all the 129 million reasons why we
                    needed better leadership and how each of these had in their own way contributed.
                    You don't have many left to contribute to. I can't remember who the present one
                    is.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: The present head of CA is Mary Ryan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you just give us a quick summary of who were
                        youleaders through your retirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Okay. Joan Clark succeeded Diego Asencio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was another career officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: She was a career officer from the administration area. She had been
                    ambassador to Malta, a deputy director general, an executive director in the EUR
                    Bureau, had a career stretching back to the Berlin Airlift her initial
                    assignment having been, I think, a cargo checker standing on the runways in
                    Berlin. She was staff corps. She suffered life-long discomfort from a therm
                    condition caused by serving on the runway in Berlin. She could never become warm
                    enough. Like a permanent case of chill blains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This can be hurtful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. Anyway she had a very long and illustrious career and was very
                    highly regarded in the Foreign Service. She had also been an assignment officer
                    too for the administrative people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does she fit into Consular Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, there was a vacancy [Asencio had been named ambassador to
                    Brazil]. For whatever reason Joan was available from her previous assignment.
                    The Department had a problem every time the job became unencumbered and that was
                    that there continued to be a faction outside the government that felt that that
                    should be politically encumbered. The White House has traditionally wanted to
                    seize the job for political appointees for policy and partisan political
                    reasons.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>There are always considerations out there, that need to be satisfied by numbers
                    and the CA function, with all the fine things we say about how we have elevated
                    its stature, still doesn't count consistently for a whole lot as far as the main
                    line interests of the foreign policy establishment. The political interests are
                    primarily to keep the public happy. That results in every time the job is to be
                    vacant there is a great deal of consternation in the State Department in a
                    careful crafting of the lists of potential incumbents and selection of the
                    candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And making sure that the candidate has all of the
                        qualitieneeded for that position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Absolutely. When Diego was coming out there was obviously diverse
                    interest in filling the job. Joan was female, a highly respected professional,
                    so she was immune from certain kinds of limiters, shall we say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She did have knowledge of Consular Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: She had been an ambassador and an admin person at the highest levels.
                    She knew the resources system, and that is a principal concern. She knew the
                    personnel assignment system, which is a principal concern in running the
                    consular operation. She had some familiarity with automation having been in
                    personnel when they automated a lot of personnel processes. She had been
                    supportive of the consular requirements when she was in geographic bureaus. So,
                    there were lots of reasons why she was more than a suitable candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she come forward into history with any particular
                        qualities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Joan was probably more of a hands on manager than most all of her
                    predecessors. Her style of management got down to the desk level. Some probably
                    felt that she micro-managed, but I am not prepared to say that one way or
                    another. Her management style was to wander into the nooks and crannies of the
                    processes and make sure that things were ship shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she was management oriented in the sense of “ship
                        shape”.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes, I think so. I think that is fair. I don't think she enjoyed the
                    same day-in-day-out deep involvement in policy issues. It was just not her
                    style. She was an admin person used to making things happen. Diego was much more
                    reflective and loved to deal at length, ad nauseam, in argumentative discussion
                    of policy pluses and minuses, and ins and outs. Barbara was more legally
                    oriented. She was a lawyer. Lenny was more ideologically driven. You really had
                    a contrast here.</p>
                <p>Q: Now the lady that you won't mention, I will because it is part of published
                    history: Elizabeth Tamposi, political appointee from New Hampshire. She had some
                    sincere limitations, one of the most serious from the bureau's standpoint was
                    that she was on duty at the time of the destruction of PanAm 103, over Scotland.
                    The Department was held inordinately responsible, especially Consular Affairs,
                    for its lack of sympathetic understanding of the tragedy of the act of
                    terrorism. She also was on board when, unfortunately, the passport documentation
                    of Bill Clinton, a president-to-be, and his mother were put through a series of
                    blunders. It was sad for the Department.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: What can be added to that, I believe, is that the then secretary of
                    state, career officer, Larry Eagleburger, summarily fired her, rightly or
                    wrongly. The activity that resulted under her stewardship during a presidential
                    campaign became embarrassing to everyone for whatever reason. She retired back
                    to New Hampshire. She came in as a political appointee as was the
                    administration's right to do. I don't believe she felt comfortable in the
                    role.</p>
                <p>She returned to private life and was followed by her former deputy, Mary Ryan.
                    Mary Ryan was Ms. Tamposi's deputy and Ms. Tamposi felt uncomfortable with her.
                    Mary is of the highest career and well known to be a very outstanding and
                    upstanding officer. Her presence was dismissed by Ms. Tamposi and upon Ms.
                    Tamposi's release she came back to CA, this time as assistant secretary. She has
                    been greatly loved. She has spent a lot of time working with the line level
                    officers and loves to use the consular conferences as an opportunity to meet and
                    deal with and be seen and known by her clients.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now back to the consular package, which is still
                        used.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: The consular package is probably used more now than perhaps it was in
                    some of the in-between years. There was some weakening of its utility during a
                    couple of administrations but I think it has been put back into a very prominent
                    position. The need has not changed. It has been made easier by virtue of the
                    further application of automated tools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, no in-house problems with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I'm sure there are always problems with it. There will always be one
                    basic problem, Bill, and I guess it is worth mentioning. We began with the fee
                    schedule and moved over the years to measure certain elements of work that were
                    captured by the fee schedule, to eliminate some that were over identified. There
                    is a constant war as to whether we are measuring the right things. So, you have
                    a contest of do you change the measured elements and lose the analytical,
                    historical and political value of being able to look forward and backward with
                    long eye sight for improving the precision of measuring where your time is
                    going, or do you maintain the elements that people are used to seeing and are
                    useful for looking backward and forwards and use your verbal textural material
                    to carry messages that are not adequately borne out by the numbers.I held fast
                    to standard units. Subsequently they were reduced in number but the consistent
                    units have been maintained.. So, while a purest will look and say this doesn't
                    adequately cover certain of your manpower considerations that should be measured
                    because they are important, they have continued to choose, and correctly I
                    think, to address that in textual ways rather than change the counted units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But all statisticians have to compromise these
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, here you make it a little more dicey in that there are the
                    political issues which are not just statistical. A statistician will probably
                    make more changes in what he is counting, as the Census Bureau, in order to more
                    accurately depict what is going on. But, when your credibility depends on
                    consistency, if you begin to change things you unnecessarily come under
                    suspicion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That you are changing something or just changing degrees
                        oinformation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: What you begin to lose is credibility, that you have created. And
                    this is a judgment call. My only point is that they are sticking with the
                    approach that we used and that was changes in accounted activities through
                    natural movement. As you need to get more meaning through other things that are
                    happening, do it descriptively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your immediate successor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Currently, Frank Moss, a Civil Service officer and senior executive
                    person is executive director. He was preceded by a Foreign Service officer, who
                    in turn was preceded by my successor, a fellow who had been an executive
                    director elsewhere in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then there wasn't much continuity after your
                        departure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, the person who followed me had been an executive director. The
                    person who followed that person was in the Visa Office and involved in the
                    consular package over the years. He wasn't there very long, but it was planned
                    that he would be sort of a bridge. Frank Moss has been in the job for a little
                    more than a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you institutionalized it to such a degree little would
                        baffected negatively.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It is a different era. I probably could not function adequately in
                    the present milieu, it is so changed. I am technologically obsolete.</p>
                <p>Q: You certainly came into technology and into computers and today's world in
                    different directions at different times. What you have said to me, as an
                    experienced consular and Foreign Service officer, is very important because you
                    do need the new generation behind you well trained, and intellectually able to
                    accept historical realities... Would you summarize this?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes. Let me track it a little bit. When I arrived in CA automation
                    consisted of punch paper tape machines, flexawriters, EAM cards and connections
                    to one IBM 360 in the basement of the State Department. Shortly down the road it
                    was realized that we needed to get out of typewriters and old addressographs
                    abroad and participated in a working group on “selection” that resulted in the
                    selection of WANG Corporation. It was the only domestic producers of automation
                    equipment that could provide us a worldwide network of service. If it didn't
                    exist they were willing to commit themselves contractually to buying locally
                    service at posts to maintain equipment. This was a serious issue because this
                    stuff is going to be shoved in 250 places around the world and it had to be kept
                    up, maintained.</p>
                <p>We went into a procurement that resulted in a master contract that remained in
                    place for over a decade. It began with word-processing. That was automation. You
                    didn't automate office practices and procedures, you automated typewriting. So,
                    WANG word processing was procured and sold around the world. In that context we
                    began to use the WANG equipment to automate visa processes abroad. We began to
                    use parallel equipment in the Passport Office to further automate. We remained
                    with the WANG contract and WANG developed many computers. These were small main
                    frames that could be established abroad and maintained abroad and to which you
                    could connect networks. This was heaven!</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>We embarked on a program of redesigning visa and other processes at post that
                    would key into a mini computer installed in the post. The mini computer then
                    interchanging with the communications system for name checks with the main frame
                    computer back here. We did not export the name check. That advanced to the point
                    that it nearly collapsed. We ended up with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
                    mini computers around the world, complex data basis, partially decentralized,
                    interfacing with the communications system that often didn't work right - still
                    doesn't - back to sophisticated centralized software and main frame computers in
                    Washington which eventually became linked with customs and INS, so your name
                    checks now cross over agency lines to other data bases. We don't suck your data
                    bases in but link the data bases so the name in one will show up in another
                    check.</p>
                <p>This resulted in further automation in consular operations but also resulted in
                    an absolute disaster around the world of hundreds of mini computers demanding
                    hundreds of sophisticated staffers, technicians who can maintain them. We
                    embarked on an enormous recruitment program for technicians to assign abroad
                    because for security reasons we couldn't use Foreign Service nationals. When we
                    did they penetrated security. Remember there was one computer room in Eastern
                    Europe where the national who was running it was a KGB type and they found a
                    hard wire coming out of the next room that went out of the building!</p>
                <p>In any event we reached the point of saturation of the mini computer technology.
                    We were quite advanced in our use of it in consular operations. We were the only
                    process at post that was automated. The only other use that was made of the
                    equipment was for word processing for administrative support.</p>
                <p>Realizing that we were stuck with a produce that was becoming obsolete, we
                    triggered action to get into a different equipment approach. The State
                    Department was probably $160 or $180 million committed to WANG. In those days
                    you couldn't expect congress to give you replacement money to that tune. You had
                    to find a way to move alone evolutionary. And, yet, WANG was becoming a bankrupt
                    company and began not to produce its own stuff. It was labeling IBM equipment.
                    It was funny. We were getting equipment from IBM that had to be re-labeled WANG
                    because we could only buy from WANG and we depended on their software and their
                    ability to support the hardware became nil. Here we are a global organization
                    with a failing technology.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>After my retirement I became associated with the centralized information
                    technology arm of the Department. In that context I was involved in a
                    procurement operation which led to under the label ONA a logical approach to
                    modernization a few years ago. Pat Kennedy was in A and was very helpful. In
                    fact, it was his organization then. We came up with a way that we could get
                    budgetary support for the replacement of all the WANG stuff globally. That
                    program completes this year. All embassies and all posts will have had
                    replacement PCs, we are talking about personal computer technology, which is
                    networking in a sophisticated way, not word processing stuff. So, it was a total
                    embassy approach now which is fully networked, working out of PCs, not enhanced
                    word processing and mini computers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And secure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: One of the big problems of the Department's approach to automation
                    with the WANG material was that it was not secure. The cables in the State
                    Department even now must be prepared only on machines that do not emanate any
                    electronic signals that can be intercepted, translated and converted to text so
                    that you are not violating security requirements.</p>
                <p>NSA created what it calls “tempest” technology, whereas a machine that might cost
                    you $4,000 if it were tempest, which means shielded, etc., might cost you
                    $15,000. So you can see it never caught on.</p>
                <p>It was happening even in the bureaus. A funny aside. We were on WANG technology
                    and in the press of business in the Visa Office you send many, many cables. It
                    was prohibited that they be produced on WANG machines because they were not
                    tempest cleared. You could only use a manual typewriter. We had in the bureau a
                    WANG mini computer network system. What they began to do was prepare the cables
                    on the word processors, snap them out and put the security classification on by
                    typewriter and then furnish them to the cable room. So, the security was typed
                    on the thing after it had been produced out of the data base.</p>
                <p>Not knowing this, I volunteered to be the first guinea pig to be inspected by the
                    inspection corps in their first effort in looking at how automation was being
                    used and was it being safely and properly used. They came into the bureau and I
                    didn't know at the time that there was software that even though you erased
                    something in a computer, all you do is move the address of the information, you
                    don't remove the information. They came in and bled out information that had
                    been erased and found that all the cables being produced in the Visa Office,
                    classified stuff, were being prepared on the word processors and handled as I
                    described.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>They took my tape drives. In those days these things were a very expensive thing
                    on the computer. They confiscated physically, about $70,000 worth of tape
                    drives. They said, “Somerville, you are going to pay for this. Now you are a
                    good guy and this is a dry run and we understand this, but we are not going to
                    return your tape drives.” This meant we had to find money to replace the damn
                    things.</p>
                <p>Q: I can remember well in the field when the consular officer had only a Foreign
                    Service national who would type things on a typewriter. She did it without a
                    classification on it. You then took the cable and typed on the
                    classification.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: We had the envy of the Department. Also you may recall we had a
                    private communications network, the TWX, which carried the name check material
                    from post to Washington and back to post. We could use that TWX line for “back
                    channel” communications, although it wasn't terribly legal. Nobody in the
                    embassy had any similar alternative to it, only we had that sort of thing, so it
                    was used by others. Our concern was that its use became so rampant that record
                    information was not being retained because the officers were using them for
                    advisory and it was gone as soon as it was received.</p>
                <p>It got even more dicey. Pat Kennedy was the chief administrative guy supporting
                    George Schultz as his executive secretary back when fax machines were very
                    novel. He had the only three in the Department of State and they were for use on
                    the secretary's personal plane. He called one day and said, “Ron, these things
                    are too damn heavy. My guys are bitching and moaning because they are having to
                    carry them on and off airplanes. Let's make a deal. I don't have any money, you
                    have money. I have three fax machines. I need three new ones which are faster
                    and lightweight so they can be lugged around. Let's make deal. You cut a
                    requisition and buy the new ones and I will give you mine for the new ones. I
                    will carry the paper because I couldn't get authorization, if you agree to
                    that.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Fine. You need the paper I will give you the numbers.” As a result CA
                    had the first three fax machines outside the secretary's office. We put one in
                    visa, one in “systems” and one in my office so we could do fax communication.
                    What I found was that this was useful in dealing with the posts because it
                    didn't have the same problems as the TWX system. But, overseas, the only people
                    who had them were the USIS offices. So, we had to make an arrangement with USIS
                    that when we wanted to fax to our consular guys it would come out in the USIS
                    library.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is really secure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: In this case it was a marriage that brought them even closer
                    together. A consular officer and an administrative officer learned how to
                    cooperate mutually.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Q: Ron, I have the distinct impression that you have very well summarized things.
                    But, let's run over those things in your experience that you either want to
                    bring up, perhaps pointedly, or remind us of some of your higher or lower points
                    of your career, whatever. Let this be your over-all career summary.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Great. A couple of things I will say about the years that I spent in
                    CA. It is pretty apparent that sustained support for the consular function,
                    consular operations, etc., won't come about by chance. If CA - I say CA because
                    I think in many respects CA has to be responsible for its own destiny - is not
                    able to maintain cooperative, mutually productive relationships with each of the
                    two judiciary committees, with the authorizing and appropriating committee
                    staffs, involve them in the operations to the extent that is possible in terms
                    of information flow, in terms of participation, even in terms of direct
                    communication by individuals prominent on both sides; likewise with the Office
                    of Management and Budget, the principal examiners, competition for attention,
                    resources, bread and butter things like promotions, key assignments, cross
                    training - the whole ball of wax - competition is so severe in the State
                    Department that State can easily revert to what it was 15 or 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>It is always an issue. It is not to be cursed. It is not to be regretted. It is
                    to be acknowledged and dealt with. The State Department hires on balance very,
                    very bright people. I spent time as an inspector looking at many agencies when I
                    was with the Civil Service Commission and I can say, based on my own experience,
                    that the type of individual typically hired in the State Department is far more
                    verbal, more analytically inclined than almost any other agency in government.
                    With that brain trust you have very bright people who will gather to themselves
                    the tools they need to be successful.</p>
                <p>Success is defined in a much narrower ground than in departmentally. It is
                    defined in very personal terms. The organization will be structured because it
                    is controlled and operated by those same practitioners. It will be structured
                    and operated to enhance the possibilities of success. If you are not on the same
                    train you get forgotten and that is not good or bad, it is just the nature of
                    the beast.</p>
                <p>And, so CA people in the future are going to have to do the same kind of hill
                    climbing, clamoring, doing things necessary to make themselves be perceived as
                    important. Important in terms of starting with bread and butter issues, in terms
                    of getting attention for their resource requirements that don't disadvantage
                    other parts of the Department. In the past the Department was perceived as a
                    place of zero sum in that if consular squawked and got more stats somebody lost.
                    A political report didn't get issued. An ambassador didn't have a secretary. I
                    think in the present environment that feeling is not extant because there has
                    been a general raising of all ships over the last 15 years and because CA does
                    have some independent access to resources there is not the same animosity and
                    jealousy. It takes work to keep that. It takes a lot of nurture.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Q: The only thing you haven't mentioned in detail is the “substance” of consular
                    work: that is, service to American citizens when abroad; passport issuance,
                    protection when arrested and jail. These demands on consular officers will never
                    stop, unless somehow our nation stops. The second substantive issue is service
                    to aliens needing to enter the United States. State will always adjudicate visas
                    since nobody else will take the responsibility unless congress says that another
                    federal unit must?.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Congress has every couple of years brought up the possibility of re-
                    engineering the executive branch for immigrant and citizenship documentation
                    purposes. There is right this month in congress a discussion with the INS
                    [Immigration and Naturalization Service] about reorganization of INS that would
                    split it into two agencies within Justice or would create two clear pieces under
                    a commissioner. Doris Misner [present commissioner] favors the single
                    commissioner and two clear pieces, while Congress is talking about two agencies.
                    Within the last three years a commission recommended that a part of the INS be
                    split off and given to the State Department because the State Department now had
                    better stewardship, now was better run, now could more assuredly provide the
                    service that congress wanted. That is a change. A hell of a change from 20 years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>A commission, eight years ago, chaired by Diego Asencio, former assistant
                    secretary, recommended that the passport function be taken away from State and
                    given to INS. So the pot bubbles. There are alternative organizational
                    arrangements that can be made. The visa function in Canada is carried out
                    independent of its foreign policy establishment and works very efficiency
                    according to everything I have heard.</p>
                <p>The passport documentation function in various countries isn't done by the
                    foreign ministries in most cases, but by the interior ministry. It doesn't need
                    to be in the State Department. If State ever lost it, it would lose an awful
                    lot. It would lose one of the few processes to take it into contact with John Q.
                    Public. There is virtually nothing else State does that directly touches a
                    citizen in the US.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We call CA the American Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: And that is what it is. If you lose touch with thfolks there is no
                    support for anything else you want to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have we converted some in the State Department to
                        understanbetter what the consular function is and how we are important to
                        State?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes and no. I think an officer's perspective changes markedly
                    depending on where he is organizationally. The consular section has
                    traditionally provided the Foreign Service officer corps, as a sheltered
                    immersion opportunity for new officers to learn the culture of the Foreign
                    Service, to learn the vagaries of living abroad with a family, of assimilating
                    in another culture, of using a different language to communicate, of learning
                    how to live with bosses. There is a culturation process and orientation process
                    that is probably parallel only in the military in terms of change of one's life
                    patterns when you take a job.</p>
                <p>The consular section provides an opportunity for officers to learn a whole lot in
                    their first two tours that is very useful. I have said for years that the
                    consular operation permitted the Department to support a high ranking,
                    political, economic structure by providing a base for orientation. With moves in
                    the last decade to use more dependents for the fodder-type jobs and to use to
                    some extent retirees as Foreign Service Reserve officers, we have reduced the
                    use of junior officers thereby depriving them, I think, of a bonafide,
                    honest-to-god useful orientation period in their career.</p>
                <p>There are few other opportunities in the State Department that a Foreign Service
                    officer will get, an opportunity to manage, to plan a budget, to analyze and
                    change a workload, to supervise people directly. So, by cutting off this
                    universal opportunist — which was known, however, as the universal curse to
                    some, we have, I think, to some extent brought injury to the ability of the
                    Foreign Service in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about to serve the American public?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: That is the number one role of the chief representative abroad, of
                    the American diplomat. And, I have had American ambassadors remind me of that,
                    who are political appointees. “What are you here for primarily?”, and this was
                    not as chief of the consular section, it was his chief of the political section,
                    “To protect American citizens in all forms.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we have exposed Ambassadors to this more in the
                        last 2years or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Absolutely. World events have caused that too. But, you still have a
                    good amount of feeling that that is a diversion from “true work”. The holy grail
                    continues to be reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which always will be, and maybe must be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I'm not at all sure. With the advent of the Internet and taking an
                    examination right today of how information is flowing in the system, political
                    reports are no longer the holy grail that they once were. When you get to the
                    point I think we can foresee within five years, where the State Department will
                    be using web based technology for political reporting, using the Internet as a
                    transport mechanism from the post to Washington, you will measure, as you do in
                    a web page, how much use is made of the information that is being reported. Two
                    hits in two years? Is it worth compiling? You don't now know anything about
                    readership when you create a document overseas or send information. All you do
                    is throw it into the damn pond.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you mean that after this wonderful consular management package that we
                    have, even the political section can't measure some of those things now?</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: They can't. When they send something in it is gone. You stipulate an
                    address on a TAG [Locator index of subject and location] but you don't know
                    where it goes. You don't know if anybody ever sees it. You don't know if it is
                    ever used. You just know that you sent it. The only way they know now is if
                    somebody comes back saying it was a good report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They have none of that approved now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: No. Zip! It is coming, but it is not there now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your point is that it is necessary to survive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Well, the information in a number of the more advanced governments is
                    now disseminated from web pages. This is true in Scandinavia and certain other
                    European countries. It is becoming true in Asia. We are beginning to play with
                    it in public diplomacy, but we are not there yet. As things are web-paged with
                    periodical information, as with the Washington Post, you have parallel things
                    happening around the world. These things are all in electronic form. Your
                    reporting job will be going from web page to web page. But, you don't need to be
                    sitting in Rome to do that because when you call up the foreign affairs ministry
                    in Rome on their web page, where are you sitting? You can do it from Washington.
                    I predict that the trend of the last 50 years of centralized decision-making
                    ain't going to reverse. We talked devolution. It is not going to happen. I think
                    the trend is going to reverse that.</p>
                <p>Q: The only thing you have left out of that is personal contacts, the human
                    relationships and all those horrible things and wonderful things that make
                    foreign affairs, international affairs and human affairs, affairs. If you
                    translate everyone into a machine of some sort or a place or a disk, whatever.
                    It is not even going to work for visa operations.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: How are battlefields controlled? How was Kuwait controlled? Where was
                    it controlled from? It was controlled from the war room in the Pentagon and the
                    White House. Where was the Kosovo stuff controlled from? It wasn't controlled
                    from the Avian airbase in Italy, it was controlled remotely.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes and no. But, maybe with that we should kiss the value of the consular
                    function goodby. And you have reminded us very well, Ron, of what it has done
                    for others in the State Department, and our own service to all Consular Affairs.
                    I am not saying goodby at this point because I want you to give us our last
                    words, be they pages, but the important thing is you have seen it. You have
                    walked through it and I walked through it with you, gratefully, as many others
                    have too and seen the change.</p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was an era of change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a lot of fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are your final words to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Right now? Traffic is mounting on the Beltway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those are words of the reality of Washington in
                        retirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: I think probably now is about as exciting a time as ever to be in the
                    consular operation. The elements of excitement should be as strong or stronger
                    now as they have ever been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that speaks of your devolution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: It was a fun time for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SOMERVILLE: Yes, I do. Very much so. I think the security of job definition and
                    job constraints is now going to be a thing of the past. Officers are going to
                    have to deal with less defined parameters. That is wonderful although for many
                    of the older officers it may not be very tolerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you, Ron.</hi>
