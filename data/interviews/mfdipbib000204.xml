                <p>An interview withPhillip Ely Church</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: W. Haven North</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 7, 1997</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Phillip Ely Church who has
                        served with the foreign assistance program for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Twenty-five years. I joined the Foreign Service in 1970s and retired in
                    1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'd like to start off with a little bit about where you
                        grew up, your early education and work experience prior to joining the
                        Foreign Service, and any particular orientation that would explain why you
                        got into international development as opposed to something else. So, lead
                        off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early education and career preparation</p>
                <p>CHURCH: I grew up in Portland, Oregon and attended through high school there. (My
                    high school made a little notoriety recently when it was selected as the setting
                    for the movie, “Mr. Holland's Opus” which was released in 1996.) Portland is a
                    nice west-coast town, a wonderful place in which to grow up. My sister and I
                    were raised by a great set of parents who made every sacrifice necessary to
                    assure we got the education we needed to succeed in life. I was the first in my
                    extended family of aunts, uncles and cousins to finish college and the only one
                    to go on and complete a Ph.D. degree.</p>
                <p>I don't think I ever would have gotten involved in international development work
                    if I hadn't gone on to college at the University of Chicago. I applied to a
                    couple of local colleges in Oregon, but with encouragement from a very
                    persuasive college recruiter, I also sent an application to the University of
                    Chicago. For reasons that I can only believe now to be the University's effort
                    to attract a more geographically diverse student body from around the country, I
                    was awarded a scholarship so that I could go “back east” to school.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>So, after graduating from high school in 1959 in Portland, Oregon, I got on a
                    train with one trunk of books and one suitcase of clothes, and headed east
                    across the country to college. When I arrived in Chicago two days later and made
                    my way to the university campus in Hyde Park on the south side, I had a rude
                    awakening. I was amongst a group of very well equipped undergraduates that had
                    deigned to come west to college from the East Coast. I found it a real challenge
                    to keep up with these classmates. To give an example, in our humanities
                    “introduction to the arts” class, we were assigned to analyze pieces of
                    symphonic music. Now I was doing good if I could come up with the symphony name,
                    while my east coast classmates not only knew the symphony but could tell what
                    orchestra was playing and who was conducting!</p>
                <p>Despite my struggles to keep up in course work, Chicago student life provided an
                    interesting exposure to the world in the decade of the '60s. Remember, this was
                    the decade of the civil rights movement in the U.S. and of revolutions for
                    independence in Africa and for freedom from dictatorial systems of government in
                    Latin America and Asia. Much of sub-Saharan Africa during that period was moving
                    from colonial status under the European powers to independence. In Asia, the
                    newly independent democracies of Pakistan and India which we looked to as
                    hopeful democracy success stories for the future were at each other's throats. A
                    very nasty little war was brewing in Vietnam at the time, and in Latin America,
                    a dictator was thrown out of power in Havana, Cuba, when a former university
                    student, Fidel Castro, came down out of the mountains of Cienfuegos to establish
                    a socialist government 90 miles off the shores of the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of these things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Very much aware. The very activist Chicago university student environment
                    was caught up in either promoting or protesting many of the domestic and
                    international political events of the decade. Of course, I became involved as
                    well. In fact, I can say that, in all honesty, one of the most influential
                    people in my life and one who indirectly launched me on a career in
                    international development was Fidel Castro.</p>
                <p>During my first Christmas winter holiday break at the University of Chicago in
                    1959, I didn't have enough time or money to go home to Oregon for Christmas, but
                    I wanted to go somewhere for relief from the Chicago winter. Fidel Castro had
                    just come to power in Cuba and, as part of his propaganda drive to gain support
                    for his new political regime, had extended an invitation to university students
                    all over the U.S. to come and visit Havana and see his revolution. So five of us
                    got into a little Volkswagen beetle and drove for a day and a half to Miami
                    where for $90 we boarded a “Cubana” Airlines plane and spent a week in Havana,
                    Cuba, courtesy of Fidel's revolutionary government. We stayed in an expropriated
                    luxury hotel overlooking Havana's harbor, and each day we were bussed around the
                    island to look at projects the government was showcasing.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Well, I came back from that trip very troubled by the human costs of the reforms
                    he was fostering. But that first hand experience of revolutionary Cuba did
                    impress me with the suppressed dynamism of a developing country struggling to
                    emerge from poverty and corruption. As a result, I changed my academic program
                    from psychology to economics and determined to seek other ways to get overseas
                    again to learn more about the potential for economic and social growth in the
                    developing world.</p>
                <p>Two years later in 1962 through an international summer job exchange program for
                    business and economics students I returned to Latin America, this time to Lima,
                    Peru. In Peru, I got another perspective on the developing world with an
                    exposure to the social and economic problems of a society of a few extremely
                    wealthy and many extremely poor. I went back to Latin America a few years later,
                    again on another student exchange this time for a year on a Fulbright grant
                    where I did thesis research for my Masters at Stanford University, and again
                    later as a graduate student at the University of Oregon to conduct research in
                    Guatemala for my Ph.D. in economics. It was in Guatemala that I came to learn
                    about USAID [United States Agency for International Development] and decided to
                    apply for a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any professors that particularly stood out in
                        your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: There were. One of my instructors, Manning Nash, a Professor of
                    Anthropology at the University of Chicago had written a very interesting book
                    called The Machine Age Maya about the introduction of technology to the Indians
                    in the highland mountain regions of Guatemala. He conducted a socioeconomic
                    study of the introduction of a textile mill into a very traditional Indian
                    community. As a student of his as well as of Theodore Schultz, whose own
                    research into the economic behavior of Guatemalan Indians resulted in a book
                    titled Penny Capitalism, I became excited about the potential for economic
                    development even if the economic growth models of the day had yet to show much
                    of an impact on poverty.</p>
                <p>While these two Anthropology professors introduced me to a lot of exciting
                    development issues, I remained an economics student even though the discipline
                    focused largely on macroeconomic issues related to monetary and fiscal policy.
                    What I saw was a need in the developing world to integrate macro- or
                    national-level economic policy with grass roots micro or community and
                    individual consumer- and producer-level behavior of local communities outside
                    the economic mainstream. Later, during my Ph.D. program at the University of
                    Oregon, I was fortunate to meet another professor, Raymond Mikesell, an
                    international trade and development economist, who supported my thesis research
                    in Guatemala where I had a chance to study some of the same highland Indian
                    communities where Nash and Schultz had done their earlier work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did your doctorate at Oregon? What was your
                        thesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CHURCH: After the University of Chicago I went first to Stanford University, in a
                    two-year Masters Degree Program in Hispanic-American Studies. The program
                    included a year in Montevideo, Uruguay on a Fulbright Scholarship to study the
                    Latin American Free Trade Agreement, (LAFTA) an economic integration effort
                    among Mexico and countries of South American along the lines of the European
                    Economic Community which was also coalescing at the time. I took the Fulbright
                    Scholarship year to study just how effective a common market framework might be
                    among developing countries as compared to the developed countries of Europe.</p>
                <p>My Fulbright fellowship year in Uruguay was also my first opportunity for an
                    extended emersion in the developing world. After finishing my masters thesis
                    research in 1965, I recognized just how important more advanced study into
                    international economic development issues was. I decided therefore to go on for
                    my Ph.D. in economics before starting a career. So I “went home” to Oregon in
                    1966 and launched into three more of years study for my doctorate.</p>
                <p>I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Oregon in 1970s. My
                    thesis was on the Indian marketing system in the highlands of Guatemala. I took
                    an approach similar to that of Theodore Schultz; his research examined how
                    economically rational the non-western Guatemalan Indian farmers behaved in
                    managing their farm production resources. I sought to answer a related question
                    about how economically rational these indigenous communities were in their
                    market trading behavior. Until that time, a popular belief was that
                    “non-western” societies were poor because they were not economically rational
                    and therefore did not produce and trade in a fashion that would lead to greater
                    efficiency and prosperity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular points you got from that study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: There is one point that appeared very relevant to USAID's early efforts
                    at development assistance in Guatemala. When you go into an Indian village in
                    the highlands of Guatemala on market day, you'll see a great deal of commercial
                    activity - a lot of small buyers and sellers of similar products like corn,
                    beans, chickens, hogs, rice, and textiles. They obey all the economic laws of
                    efficient markets: large numbers of buyers and sellers, homogeneous products,
                    easy market entry and plenty of price and product information. They will haggle
                    over price with their relatives and neighbors as vigorously as with a stranger.
                    It's a very competitive process. All the conditions of market competition
                    prevail. Larger merchants took advantage of this fragmented and internally
                    competitive nature of these Indian communities to buy low and capture the bulk
                    of farm produce that they then could resale at much higher prices at very
                    profitable margins.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Now, the USAID's strategy aimed to organize Guatemalan Indian farmers into
                    cooperatives to buy and sell collectively so they could get better prices for
                    their inputs and produce. But this “cooperative strategy” was often at odds with
                    the very competitive nature of the Guatemalan Indian culture. The concept of a
                    cooperative movement didn't fit too well with the very competitive nature of
                    local communities. Getting Indian farmer-traders together so they could bargain
                    collectively with more powerful merchants from outside the community proved very
                    difficult. It took a while for USAID to realize that in such settings a
                    cooperative movement required strong economic incentives to overcome the local
                    competitive forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened after you finished your graduate work?
                        How did you connect with USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: As often happens with graduate students, I ran out of money and time
                    during my research in Guatemala. There was a wonderful Mission Director at the
                    time in Guatemala by the name of Dean Hinton. Shortly after his arrival in
                    Guatemala, Hinton invited a team of economists from Iowa State University to
                    help design a development program for the country. They needed information on
                    conditions in the regions of the country where I had been doing my research. I
                    was able to sign on with the team for six more months to help write a Guatemalan
                    economic assistance strategy focused on the highland of the country. I got to
                    know the mission and the staff at that time, of course, and learned a bit about
                    the USAID program. Dean Hinton encouraged me to consider joining USAID. When I
                    returned to the United States to defend my thesis I submitted an application to
                    the Agency. Several months later very close to graduation, a letter came from
                    USAID inviting me to go back to Guatemala as a USAID foreign service officer. I
                    was thrilled, and, of course, said “Yes.” So, in September of 1970s I finished
                    at Oregon, and my wife and I came to Washington where, in October, I was sworn
                    in as a foreign service officer, given two weeks of orientation and in November
                    packed off to Guatemala as a USAID program economist.</p>
                <p>Assignment to the USAID Program in Guatemala (1970-73)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about Guatemala. What was the situation
                        when you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I arrived at a very difficult time in Guatemala. A few months earlier,
                    the American Ambassador to Guatemala had been gunned down in the streets of the
                    capital city. There was constant urban guerrilla activity going on. Che Guevara
                    was loose in the mountains of Bolivia. The United States was very concerned
                    about Castro and his impact in the region, and so there had been a concerted
                    effort on the part of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the 1960s to
                    provide greater economic assistance to the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Of concern to many of us was the entrenched poverty among the highland Indian
                    communities and the fear they might get caught up in a rural revolution. About
                    half of the country's 6.0 million population were of Mayan Indian descent living
                    in the western highlands of the country. The old somewhat “feudal” colonial
                    plantation system was giving way but nothing viable seemed to be emerging in its
                    place. The Indian community in Guatemala traditionally depended on the
                    established landowning class for employment on their large plantations and
                    farms. And the land owners depended on the Indian population for low-cost labor
                    to keep down the prices of their sugar, coffee, cotton and banana exports. In
                    the first half of the century, Guatemala had instated indigent laws that allowed
                    the government to conscript anyone not working into harvesting coffee, sugar
                    cane, cotton, and bananas.</p>
                <p>When the indigent laws were abolished, land owners feared the economy would
                    collapse. But lower infant mortality and longer life expectancy led to a growing
                    highland Indian population that needed plantation work to supplement its meager
                    corn cultivation or milpa incomes. Moreover, increasing population was putting
                    pressure on the land and the soil was being depleted by over-cropping and
                    grazing. Because corn cultivation only lasted three or four months out of the
                    year, Indian families migrated to the coast to harvest plantation crops, no
                    longer forced by indigent laws but by population pressures on the land. In
                    short, plantation owners needed to worry no longer over the possibility of labor
                    shortages.</p>
                <p>This seasonal migratory labor arrangement also created social problems that
                    disrupted progress in Indian communities. Schooling was difficult to provide to
                    children who migrated with their families from one location to another. Health
                    conditions in the labor camps were very poor. So, it was very difficult to
                    deliver public services to improve living standards of the people who needed
                    them most. Any development assistance program had to come to terms with
                    this.</p>
                <p>The USAID mission aimed to increase smallholder farm productivity and incomes as
                    a way of breaking the country's cycle of seasonal underemployment, low-wage
                    migratory labor and poor health and education services that kept the highland
                    Indian population mired in poverty. Based on recommendations from thIowa State
                    University study on which I participated, USAID sought to reach Guatemala's
                    small Indian farmers with improved “green revolution” maize and wheat varieties
                    that were coming out of the international institutes like the Corn and Wheat
                    Institute (CIMMYT) in Mexico at that time. Shorter maturing, more rapidly
                    growing varieties would allow areas to get two harvests where they had gotten
                    one previously. This released land for cultivation of irrigated nontraditional
                    high-value vegetable crops that could be exported. It would allow the farm
                    population to remain in place in the highlands throughout the year. In this
                    manner they could then be reached with the health and education services they
                    lacked.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>There was some urgency to raising small farm productivity, incomes and jobs as
                    well. The sugar and banana industries were declining under the pressure of
                    falling international market prices and the land was going into cattle grazing
                    which had much less demand for labor. This strategy of boosting yields of
                    traditional food crops and introducing production and marketing opportunity for
                    diversified nontraditional export crops became the focus of the program on which
                    I was working as an economist in Guatemala and the other Central American
                    countries between 1970s and 1977.</p>
                <p>In 1973, when the USAID program in Guatemala was well underway and showing some
                    promising results, there was an opportunity to take the strategy “on the road”
                    to the rest of Central America, where similar needs existed in Honduras, El
                    Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The U.S. was beginning to appreciate the
                    fact that Central American producers could provide fresh fruits and vegetables
                    to the U.S. in the off-season and wouldn't compete directly with U.S. suppliers.
                    We had a challenge in the early years of the Guatemala program convincing U.S.
                    interests, including Congress, that this wouldn't be disruptive to U.S. food
                    producers. Eventually, USAID was able to help Central American countries build a
                    winter season market niche for their high value agricultural produce in the U.S.
                    By the time I left the region, refrigerated trucks were moving by ocean barge
                    from Guatemala to Florida where they were attached to tractor units and moved up
                    the east coast to urban grocery stores. USAID was building links from
                    Guatemala's highland Indian communities to east coast suburban consumers in the
                    U.S.!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any other successes in the Guatemalan
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: It all depends on how we choose to define “success.” To give you an
                    example, USAID support to the cooperative movement among Guatemala's highland
                    communities included setting up a number of warehouses or silos to store corn at
                    harvest time. The goal was to give more marketing power to Indian farmers by
                    providing the alternative of selling grain to their own cooperative rather than
                    to speculators. In the past, truckers would come up to the highlands to buy up
                    much of the corn crop at harvest - when prices were low and production debts
                    needed to be paid. They would hold the corn in their facilities, and then when
                    there was a shortage of corn in the highlands toward the beginning of the new
                    planting season, return and sell it back to the Indians at much higher
                    prices.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The USAID solution was to assist local farmer cooperatives to build small
                    cooperative warehouses using Butler bins - metal silos like you see all over
                    Iowa - and to provide some capital to the cooperatives to buy the corn at
                    harvest. In this way, they could hold it in the silos for resale back to members
                    of the cooperative and the community at a lower price than the truckers would
                    sell it when supplies became scarce. Well, I can remember going into one
                    community a couple of years after farmer cooperatives had installed the USAID
                    funded corn silos and found them sitting idle. My job was to assess why the
                    program wasn't working, why the grain bins were not being used.</p>
                <p>When I started interviewing truckers and local farmer cooperative members, I
                    learned that one very interesting development had taken place. After the silos
                    were built, the first year the truckers came to buy, they couldn't get any corn
                    at the low prices they had offered previously because the cooperatives were now
                    paying more to buy and hold the corn for their farmer members just like the
                    program was designed. But when the truckers started increasing their offering
                    prices to compete, farmers showed no loyalty to their cooperatives. As I
                    mentioned before this was a competitive culture. So farmers again sold to the
                    truckers but, this time, at a higher price. The cooperative wasn't able to buy
                    at what it could offer so the corn silos sat empty. Still the local community
                    had more money because of the better price they were able to command for their
                    maize from the truckers.</p>
                <p>Now the question is, was that a success or not? We accomplished our objective
                    which was raising the price of corn for producers by having the corn bins there,
                    but the cooperatives never really functioned as commercial units because farmers
                    sold where they could get the best price, even when that meant dealing with the
                    truckers who earlier had exploited them. A U.S. Congressman visiting one of
                    these villages and seeing an empty USAID funded grain silo might conclude the
                    USAID cooperative program was a failure. While the farmer cooperatives were not
                    successful in using the bins to buy, store and trade their members' corn, they
                    were able to force the truckers to offer a better price. The coops provided the
                    service of a market floor price. So USAID did accomplish the objective of the
                    program which was to improve the marketing position of local farmers by giving
                    them an alternative selling option.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a good illustration. Is that still a lesson that
                        USAID can use elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Yes. I would say that kind of experience could be replicated in many
                    African country contexts. I think we've seen it in the Asian setting. In fact, I
                    had an opportunity when I left Guatemala for Bangladesh, which was my next post
                    halfway around the world, to take some of those concepts to totally different
                    areas of the world and apply them with similar effectiveness. As I said, I
                    firmly believe from my experience as a USAID economist that people behave in an
                    economically rational way no matter what their stage of development is. They
                    respond rationally to economic incentives anywhere in the world if given the
                    opportunities and the options from which to choose and the capacity to act.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>One of the greatest development contributions USAID has made is providing people
                    with more opportunities to exercise economically rational behavior by helping
                    them acquire the resources - skills, land, technologies, markets - to exercise
                    choice. USAID cannot force everyone to become a loyal cooperative member. What
                    USAID can create is an environment for choice. For example, in the case of
                    Guatemala, Indian farmers now have two choices, a trucker or a cooperative to
                    trade their grain where before they only had one, a trucker. That alone was
                    enough to improve their lot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did everything go smoothly during your first overseas
                        assignment with USAID in Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Hardly. In development work there are always surprises and unexpected
                    challenges. There were two serious setbacks that we experienced during my tenure
                    with the program. One was a devastating earthquake in 1976 which laid waste to
                    large sections of the Guatemalan highlands. For the next year, we were
                    essentially mobilized to restore a lot of the services that were disrupted. The
                    earthquake not only leveled villages but brought down landslides on roads so
                    communications were cut off. We cut down trees along straight stretches of road
                    so the highway could be made into a temporary landing strip for single-engine
                    planes that flew in medical supplies and flew out the seriously injured. That
                    was in February of 1976, and it was a serious blow for Guatemala. It set back
                    the country's economic progress a decade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in that disaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The USAID mission staff had two roles. First, we found ourselves working
                    with the strategic military assistance command out of Panama which was bringing
                    in U.S. Military C-41 cargo jets with emergency tents and food for the most
                    heavily affected communities. Our immediate job was just getting an assessment
                    of the damage done and determining where the assistance was most needed. I can
                    recall getting in the light planes filled with drums of aviation gas in the back
                    and flying into these remote highway landing strips which served as staging
                    areas. A crash would have been fatal. It was a dangerous thing to do, but it was
                    the only way to get into some of these remote areas to get a good look at what
                    was going on and to deliver short term assistance by getting injured people out
                    and getting doctors and medical supplies in. In the longer run, of course, we
                    had to rethink our assistance program to assess what we could keep running while
                    the relief effort was underway. We really wanted to sustain the long run program
                    without ignoring urgent short run needs. It was not an easy balancing act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you said there was another event.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CHURCH: The other challenge we faced in Guatemala was a change in U.S. policy
                    toward the country, because of the military's influence in Guatemala's
                    government. Without a larger degree of democratic participation in the political
                    process, the United States was no longer prepared to continue economic
                    assistance at the same scale as when I arrived. One of the most difficult
                    challenges for us as development practitioners is how to help people in need in
                    a political setting that is not very conducive to that assistance. Development
                    funds are often fungible. Giving money, say, for building Guatemala's education
                    system, may not actually add anything in the way of more resources to the
                    country if the recipient government simply cuts back its own education funding
                    and instead buys more military weapons with the savings. If, on the other hand,
                    we refuse to give assistance until more democratic systems and political will is
                    in place, a lot of people at least in the short run, will suffer and the pace of
                    progress will be retarded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: In the long run, yes, but conditions did get worse before improving, with
                    civil war and political strife in the 1980s and up until just a few years ago.
                    It was not until 1995 that Guatemala had a peaceful transition from one
                    democratically elected government to the next. A peace accord had just been
                    signed with rural combatants and development assistance is starting to flow
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you sum up as the impact of that strategy you
                        helped develop during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: If you go to Guatemala and visit the highland Indian communities today,
                    you'll find a greater awareness of their capacity to improve their lives than
                    when USAID first started its development assistance programs in the country.
                    Before, people had a more fatalistic approach toward the world and to their
                    livelihood. Now there are widespread aspirations for a better life, and there is
                    a growing confidence in the ability of local communities to make it happen.</p>
                <p>Still, the country faces serious problems. Endemic disease, illiteracy, shortage
                    of potable water, and access to sanitation remain serious challenges to
                    development, particularly among the rural Indian population. Child and maternal
                    mortality figures are high. Education services also are still lacking. Guatemala
                    has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, just ahead of Haiti at the
                    bottom of the list for Latin America. There is a long way to go, but the
                    difference today is that among rural communities there is more awareness of what
                    can be done and among political leaders a bit more commitment to providing
                    support. I don't think the Mayan Indian culture would allow the clock to be
                    turned back. There is more popular pressure on the government to provide these
                    services. I don't think Guatemalan leaders can ignore that today and expect to
                    remain in power.</p>

                        area. What was your view of that potential? What were you trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: After the USAID program got under way among Guatemala's highland Indians,
                    I had the opportunity to bring my experiences to other countries in the Central
                    American region. USAID through its regional office was supporting the Central
                    American Common Market as a vehicle for development through trade and economic
                    integration. In the regional prograI had an opportunity to work and collaborate
                    with two other very influential USAID colleagues in my life - Oliver Sause and
                    Ed Marasciulo who both were Mission Directors in ROCAP. In 1973 I moved from the
                    Guatemala program to the regional office where I spent four more years traveling
                    and working in Central America, helping put together agriculture sector
                    strategies for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica. Our goal was to
                    bring in the new technology which was emerging out of the international
                    agricultural research centers, connecting it with some of the marketing
                    opportunities that existed in the Caribbean, and drawing on U.S. university and
                    private sector expertise to assist.</p>
                <p>We were all hopeful that the Central American Common Market would succeed and
                    worked hard to bring the concept to fruition. Early common market efforts had
                    focused on the industrial sector and strove to achieve in the region the
                    economic efficiencies that were possible from specialization and trade. On paper
                    it clearly made more sense for there to be, say, one tire manufacturer, one
                    pharmaceutical plant, one caustic soda factory, etc in a region of only 15
                    million people than for each country to try to foster these industries within
                    its borders. And, indeed, in the early years, agreements were reached to
                    distribute these “integration industries” among countries in the region and to
                    remove trade barriers to the movement of their products so that they could
                    produce volumes of output sufficient to keep costs low and prices competitive
                    with those of imported goods.</p>
                <p>After initial early successes with selected industries, USAID believed it was
                    timely to attempt to make some progress as well in the agricultural sector.
                    Again, the view was that Central American countries by specializing in producing
                    surplus exports of basic food crops - say, Guatemala in corn and wheat exports,
                    El Salvador and Nicaragua in rice exports and Honduras and Costa Rica in bean
                    exports - could trade with each other at lower food prices than if each country
                    tried to be self sufficient in all these crops. Moreover, land freed up from
                    such specialization could be shifted to production of high value export crops,
                    which, again, the Central America countries could specialize in to assure
                    volumes sufficiently great and reliable to penetrate U.S. markets.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the theory, of course. But what actually happened
                        during your time with the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: As you might expect, not what we hoped for! First, it was difficult to
                    convince the Central American countries to depend on each other for their food
                    needs. A bad crop year in, say, Guatemala, would mean skyrocketing corn and
                    wheat prices in the other countries in the region. If El Salvador exported too
                    much rice to meet the demands of its neighbors it might experience shortages and
                    rising prices at home. The risks of these outcomes - and the likelihood of these
                    outcomes given the often fickle meteorological conditions of the region -
                    dictated against agreeing to any kind of food grain production and trade
                    arrangements within the Common Market. Even our offer to set up a regional
                    buffer stock program for these grains, to sell in times of scarcity and buy in
                    times of surplus, was not sufficient to precipitate cooperation in regional food
                    grain production and trade.</p>
                <p>As it was, all of the Central American countries were in the early stages of
                    development during which they are importers of capital and production inputs
                    and, as a result, net deficit countries. It is difficult to achieve trade
                    cooperation among countries at that stage of development when all are looking
                    for ways to finance their trade deficits by increasing exports. All the Central
                    American countries were happy to boost exports, but none wanted to import from
                    its neighbors. The aggressive exporting countries were Costa Rica and El
                    Salvador. They also attracted a disproportionate share of investment in the
                    Common Market's “integration industries.” This left Guatemala, Honduras and
                    Nicaragua on the defensive and consequently resistant to opening trade in the
                    region. With that kind of environment, it was very hard to get a Central
                    American trading agreement going and to make it viable.</p>
                <p>It is interesting that nearly two decades later there is talk again today about
                    regional markets in the western hemisphere, this time expanding NAFTA [North
                    American Free Trade Agreement] to include, in addition to Canada, U.S. and
                    Mexico, the entire hemisphere from Chile to Canada in one “Free Trade Area of
                    the Americas!” I think we have an environment today that may be a bit more
                    appropriate for freer Western Hemispheric trade. While we did not get very far
                    with regional economic integration in the 1970s, we at least helped Central
                    American countries build capacity to be more active trading partners today. My
                    contribution was to help boost the productive capacity of the agricultural
                    sector which USAID still views as an essential building block for that type of a
                    regional trading agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work? How did you figure you were able to
                        introduce these ideas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CHURCH: The reservoir of “green revolution” technical knowledge had some
                    application in each of the Central American countries. Each had tremendous scope
                    to boost the productivity of traditional food crops and to diversify into higher
                    value export crops using available technologies. In the 1970s Central America
                    was still very much an agricultural region. To modernize the sector meant to
                    reach the largest proportion of their populations with more productive jobs and
                    better more stable incomes. I think USAID provided not only the resources but
                    also awakened governments to the need to support its traditional small farm
                    agriculture sector with training, technology and inputs to achieve and sustain
                    national economic growth.</p>
                <p>One of the questions we've asked ourselves is what happens after USAID pulls out?
                    Is the country's economic growth and prosperity sustainable? In fact, the two
                    big questions are sustainability and replicability. Did the countries have the
                    capacity to continue efforts, say, in food production, education or health
                    beyond support from outside donors; did governments have the capacity to expand
                    these programs beyond just the immediate target communities that our initial
                    assistance programs reach at their start-up by building local institutions that
                    could spread that type of activity throughout the country?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were really trying to replicate your experience in
                        Guatemala. How did you find the reception in the other Central American
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Our reception in each Central American country was unique. We had again
                    some very wide ranging political situations with which to deal, from a military
                    dictatorship in Nicaragua to a popular democracy in neighboring Costa Rica.
                    USAID had to adjust its program to accommodate the political realities that
                    existed. For a young foreign service economic officer like myself at the time,
                    it was a real learning experience. There was nobody there with the answers, so
                    we were learning by doing.</p>
                <p>We made mistakes. For example, USAID set up subsidized credit programs to attract
                    farmers that banks considered to be either poor credit risks or too costly to
                    reach with loans. But farmers often felt no obligation to repay their debts
                    because in too many cases, banks issued subsidized loans as political gifts
                    under pressure from parties in power. Moreover, credit agents lacked the will or
                    the way to enforce collections, particularly among larger more powerful farmers
                    who managed to capture many of the loans intended originally for smaller more
                    resource limited producers.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Good intentions aren't necessarily sustainable. We learned that lesson but only
                    after investing several years and several millions of dollars in subsidized and
                    “supervised” farm credit programs. We now know that credit must be bankable,
                    that giving credit for fertilizer and seed without looking at the marketing
                    outlets and income earning potential will lead to failure. Credit may boost
                    production at the outset, but if farmers have no place to sell what they produce
                    at a price that will cover costs, they won't have the income to repay loans or
                    to continue on their own.</p>
                <p>An excellent example where we did get it right was the involvement of USAID and
                    other donors in promoting Costa Rican cut flower exports in the off-season to
                    the United States. Here is an example where we looked at market opportunities
                    first and then we looked at production needs. We provided market incentives more
                    than we provided capital, and we provided opportunities for local investment,
                    equity participation. I think this was one of the greatest and most interesting
                    programs that USAID supported.</p>
                <p>At the regional level, USAID sponsored a small program that financed an
                    intermediate financial institution called the Latin American Agribusiness
                    Development Corporation (LAAD) which took equity positions in local Central
                    American agribusiness companies. But USAID leadership was not comfortable
                    handing taxpayer money to for-profit organizations at that time. USAID failed, I
                    think, to recognize that profits provide incentives for others to come into that
                    industry and compete and eventually lead to sustainable system with broad
                    development benefits. In the 1970s and 1980s USAID was not as commercial or
                    pragmatic an Agency as it is today. Early USAID efforts were more in the social
                    area: the health, population management, family planning, and education sectors.
                    USAID was a long time in learning that sustainable and replicable development
                    requires both an entrepreneurial driven incentive system as well as social
                    programs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Guatemala and its Central American partners were my first exposure to
                    work in the developing world. They were where I did my USAID “apprenticeship.” I
                    was fortunate to be assigned to a very interesting region and a very challenging
                    and diversified set of countries in which to begin a USAID career. It certainly
                    is a region where, at the time, there was a development need and where the U.S.
                    government had a direct interest in building capacity in the region to achieve
                    stable and sustainable economic growth and social progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Moreover, I had the good fortune to work with a number of excellent USAID
                    colleagues during my assignments in Guatemala and Central America. We were
                    unique, I think, at that time in USAID's history. We stood out as the first
                    USAID generation of trained development professionals. We were among the first
                    to come out of the U.S. university system with formal course work and graduate
                    degrees in international development. Our predecessors, and in some cases our
                    mentors in the field, who participated in earlier U.S. government overseas
                    assistance going back as far as the Marshall Plan in Europe and the Point Four
                    plan in Latin America, were all career specialists in engineering, agricultural
                    marketing, research and extension, infectious diseases, or education
                    administration. None were development practitioners by trade and training. We
                    were the first trained development specialists, so to speak, in the Agency.
                    International development was still an emerging career field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you characterize that development orientation as
                        different from the others? Were there features that set you apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: My first overseas assignment as an economics officer with USAID made me
                    aware that development requires a problem-solving approach, looking at the
                    situation, sizing it up, and then cooperating with beneficiaries to find a
                    workable solution. Coming at development with preconceived solutions seldom
                    works. For example, some of the old guard agriculturalists would look at
                    Guatemala or Central America and say the answer was “cucumbers” or “farm credit”
                    or “corn silos.” That was because they knew marketing cucumber, managing credit
                    or building corn silos from their work in U.S. agriculture.</p>
                <p>But a successful development strategy requires a lot of improvisation, motivation
                    and problem solving. You build answers as you encounter problems. You are
                    identifying incentives to make people go after and solve their own problems.
                    USAID's early efforts in Central America were very much aimed at importing
                    solutions rather than working with local communities on solving problems. I'd
                    like to believe that we were one of the first generations of development
                    practitioners who tried to bring that broader problem solving and social
                    engagement approach to the region's needs. My assignment to Guatemala and
                    Central America afforded me the opportunity to work with and appreciate the
                    knowledge of many brilliant and dedicated U.S. professionals, but in the end I
                    had to learn how to adapt that knowledge to the unique set of development
                    challenges the region presented.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CHURCH: We transferred directly from Guatemala to Bangladesh around Christmas
                    time 1977. Earlier, I had cast my eyes at a world map trying to decide where I
                    wanted to take my USAID career next. I had no desire yet to go back to what I
                    joked was USAID's only true “hardship post”, Washington, DC. I know I could have
                    benefitted from a tour in the U.S., getting to know how the Agency functioned,
                    because I went straight overseas to Guatemala when I joined the Agency. Still, I
                    joined the foreign service to work abroad, not in the U.S.</p>
                <p>However, the value of a Washington, DC tour with USAID became apparent in
                    Bangladesh where the Agency had a very high profile program. Bangladesh was a
                    country that Henry Kissinger had called an internationa“basket case.” Bangladesh
                    became independent from Pakistan after a bloody war in 1970s only to be
                    devastated by monsoon floods. Its first decade as a country was one more of
                    disaster relief than economic development. Many doubted that Bangladesh was
                    viable as a country.</p>
                <p>The whole South Asian continent was undergoing an exploding population. Despite a
                    “green revolution” that promised significant increases in food grain production,
                    mass starvation was still a real threat. The region at that time was still very
                    unstable both economically and politically and USAID was most anxious for some
                    economic development “success stories.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I worked in Bangladesh at perhaps one of the more promising periods in
                    the history of our assistance programs in the country. By 1977 when I arrived in
                    Bangladesh, the country was beginning to recover from a period of floods and
                    droughts that had punctuated its short life as an independent nation since its
                    bloody independence struggle with Pakistan at the beginning of the decade. Large
                    amounts of money - twentyfold what we had for programs in Central America - were
                    budgeted for Bangladesh development programs. In Central America at the time,
                    the population was 15 million. Bangladesh had nearly 90 million people in a much
                    more concentrated geographic setting. Poverty was much more widespread in
                    Bangladesh. For me, the Bangladesh program also required a lot more
                    understanding of how the USAID bureaucracy and donor community conducted and
                    coordinated a large country development assistance effort.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>CHURCH: One of the things in which I became involved was building a better
                    knowledge base of what affect our development dollars were having on peoples
                    lives. At the time USAID was working largely at what we called the “outputs”
                    level, focusing on things like how much fertilizer, credit school books or
                    condoms our programs distributed rather than how much more food was produced,
                    how many more kids were educated and how much more income or well being program
                    beneficiaries experienced. USAID's program in Bangladesh was a start, at least
                    for me, of efforts to monitor more closely these “outcomes” of our programs,
                    that is, of what our programs were accomplishing boosting food output, literacy
                    and rural incomes or lowering infant mortality, disease incidence and population
                    growth.</p>
                <p>Bangladesh was more about accomplishment because we were working in an
                    environment where life was a make-or-break situation for many people. A failed
                    crop meant hunger, even loss of life, in a setting like Bangladesh. A simple
                    disease or infection was life threatening to children already weak and
                    malnourished. Bangladesh appeared to be on a collision course between population
                    growth and food availability.</p>
                <p>USAID needed better information about what was working in our food production
                    assistance programs. Bangladesh offered an opportunity to do something
                    constructive in getting better numbers to people in USAID/Washington and in the
                    Congress who made decisions. So I spent a good share of my time in the field
                    talking to farmers, learning about their problems, learning why they were using
                    a particular seed or fertilizer or cultivation practice. A central question of
                    concern was: “Why, when new high yielding rice and wheat varieties were
                    introduced, was there such a wide gap between the crop yields that scientists
                    obtained at the experiment station and what farmers experienced in their
                    fields?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why these gaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: First, agricultural researchers could control for a number of factors on
                    their experiment stations that farmers could not in their fields — water
                    availability, pests and plant diseases, for example. Small farmers, however, do
                    not have nice well-defined farms. They cultivate a small plot of land in one
                    place, rent out a piece of land in another area, rent in another piece of land
                    from a neighboring farmer as well. A farm may consist of say 3 hectares of land
                    total but be made up of a dozen or as many as 20 or 30 small rice paddies or
                    plots scattered over an area many times that size. Each plat has its unique soil
                    conditions and planting schedule. One field may be dry; one may be wet. Our
                    surveys showed that farmers select plots so as to use their labor (and that of
                    their family members) most efficiently over the entire cultivation year, not
                    always to maximize yields.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>We quickly realized that research scientists cannot go into a region with a
                    single crop variety or cultivation practice and expect it to be adopted
                    throughout a farmer's land holding. It may be adopted only in part and only on
                    some farm plots because land varies so much by soil type, water regime and
                    fertility across any single farm operation. Farmers purposely select plots with
                    a variety of features in order to spread risks and stagger planting and
                    cultivation times in such a way as to best use their time and labor. So, new
                    crop varieties did not yield on farmer's fields what they did in experiment
                    station trials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come to any general conclusions about farming in
                        Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I think we came up with conclusions about ourselves and how we should
                    conduct agriculture research in a setting like Bangladesh. The major conclusion,
                    if there is one to be made, is that the client needs to be much more a part of
                    the development equation. I can see that going on much more today in our
                    attempts overseas to partner with our clients.</p>
                <p>In Bangladesh in the late 1970s, we were just beginning to look at the farm
                    community and the farmer as a partner in the process, as someone from whom to
                    learn. By comparison, earlier in Central America we essentially carried
                    pre-packed solutions to farmers via mobile school programs, on trucks equipped
                    with special plows and seeders to show farmers how to use this stuff. In
                    Bangladesh, we listened to how framers did it and then examined ways that we
                    could help them maybe do it better or let them look at options. We conducted a
                    lot of on-farm trials in the context of what came to be called “farming systems
                    research”, which essentially studied the whole farm unit. For example, how is
                    rice cultivation linked to the livestock enterprises on the farm and how does
                    each compete for limited family labor? We examined the interactions among the
                    several crop and livestock enterprises that made up the whole farm unit that the
                    farmer managed rather than focus exclusively on a single crop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our program in agriculture then? What were we
                        trying to do specifically apart from this approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CHURCH: In Bangladesh we were trying to close the domestic food production and
                    consumption gap. The United States was supplying as much as 2-3 million tons of
                    food grains annually to the country and more was coming from other donors,
                    notably Canada and Australia. To put that into perspective, Bangladesh produced
                    at the time I was there about 15 million tons of food grains and the donors
                    provided another 4-5 tons, about 25% of the country's total consumption needs. A
                    country is considered to be in a food vulnerability situation when it depends on
                    imports for more that 5% of its food needs. Bangladesh was nearly five times
                    that level, so the objective was to increase domestic production of basic food
                    to bring that gap down to under 5% or from 5 million tons to about one million
                    tons of grain imports. At the time the U.S. had food grain surpluses to share,
                    but no one knew what the long run forecast would be for U.S. agriculture. To
                    close that gap in Bangladesh we needed to build capacity to produce more food by
                    the country's own farmers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The primary strategy for doing that was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Improved seed and more and better fertilizer use, or so we thought at the
                    time. I think we came away from that experience realizing that improved farming
                    practices were equally critical. Seed and fertilizer were basic components, but
                    not the whole solution.</p>
                <p>An immediate problem was to get fertilizer to farmers, which the government was
                    subsidizing to encourage adoption. Well, it was catching on. Chemical fertilizer
                    was used on about 5% of the crop land in the early 1970s. When I got there in
                    1977 farmers were applying it to about 30% of the crop land. And when I left in
                    1981 the figure was at about 60%. Well, the government could afford to subsidize
                    fertilizer when it was used on only 5% of the crop land, but as usage grew,
                    subsidies began eating up the entire agriculture budget leaving little money for
                    research and extension services. Without such services crop yields from added
                    fertilizer use began to level off. Our chemical fertilizer use strategy was not
                    sustainable for the long run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to accomplish anything in that respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: There were two things that USAID can point to as fairly successful. One
                    was the privatization of the fertilizer sector. We got the government out of the
                    fertilizer business. It was entirely a government operation which is a
                    traditional pattern in that part of the world. The fertilizer corporation, the
                    fertilizer marketing, the distribution of fertilizer was all in government
                    hands. We helped the government dismantle that system and introduce private
                    distribution networks. There was a great deal of resistance at first because
                    everyone was sure the middleman would capture the profit, but we demonstrated
                    that enough middlemen would compete and bring down the margins to where they
                    could provide a better service at a cheaper cost than the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Secondly, as I already described, we brought farmers into the partnership or into
                    the process as active informants of what was needed and what worked and why,
                    whereas before we were only listening to the research station scientists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was working with the communities to introduce these
                        technologies and concepts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: As far as I could tell, one of the major ways that information was shared
                    was by word of mouth and marketplace, not the extension service. For example,
                    private fertilizer distributors became disseminators of information. I recall
                    now that you mention it, the bags had on them instructions as to how to apply
                    the fertilizer to get the best yield. So we used the market mechanism as a
                    vehicle for getting farm messages as well as chemical fertilizer into farmers'
                    hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the Ministry of Agriculture receptive to
                        doing things this way or did you essentially bypass them in this
                        approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The Ministry of Agriculture had strengths and weaknesses. I have never
                    seen more dedicated civil servants than those with whom I worked in the Ministry
                    of Agriculture in Bangladesh. But the Ministry had few resources with which to
                    support its research and extension staff. As I indicated, most of the budget was
                    still going to pay fertilizer subsidies. So agricultural researchers had few
                    vehicles to get around the countryside and had to take bicycles and buses to get
                    to farmers' plots. Their daily meal and lodging allowances were so low and so
                    miserable whenever they left the office or research station they could not
                    afford to travel without using their own money. And, of course, salaries
                    themselves were very modest. That's one of the things we also could point to. To
                    turn around this situation was to say, “OK, we'll reduce the fertilizer subsidy
                    burden, but we want to see the budget savings go into salaries, vehicles and
                    travel allowances for your research people so they can begin to work more with
                    farmers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the agriculture situation changed in that period you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: We definitely saw improvements; I think the statistics tell the story.
                    Fertilizer use continued to grow and crop yields improved even as subsidies were
                    lowered and the cost of fertilizer to farmers rose. Bangladesh has its own
                    natural gas resources which it began to use to produce urea fertilizer in the
                    country. It is less import-dependent today, despite a larger population to feed!
                    The research system has continued to maintain contact with its clients. I really
                    can't speak to whether the agricultural researchers field logistics problems
                    have been solved. I suspect the situation is better today but that Bangladesh
                    still has a ways to go.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the food deficit declining?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Not only has the food deficit declined, but in some years Bangladesh has
                    come pretty close to food self sufficiency. Now to claim food self sufficiency
                    is a little misleading in a country like Bangladesh where purchasing power is
                    such a big factor. You can have sufficient rice, on a caloric basis, but if many
                    do not have the income to buy it, they still go hungry. Still Bangladesh has
                    come very close to self sufficiency in terms of meeting its needs in the
                    nutritional basis using, say, the UN caloric minimum acceptable standards of
                    about 2,200 calories a day. Much needs to be done to raise incomes, especially
                    among the poorest so they have the resources to buy the food and other
                    necessities they need to improve their well-being.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the Bangladeshi people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I enjoyed it very much. It was a dramatic difference to be in a Muslim
                    culture from a Christian culture in Latin America. The Muslim culture is very
                    hospitable and accommodating. Muslim culture practices tolerance for
                    non-Muslims, even though many people look at the Islamic faith as being very
                    traditional. I found it a very pleasant environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the government
                        bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I observed very dedicated people enmeshed in a very rigid system. It is a
                    by-the- book type of bureaucracy, very little creativity, very little
                    originality, but a lot of dedication. As I said, it took the USAID program more
                    than a decade to disengage the government from one policy and practice,
                    fertilizer subsidies, for example. We did that not by convincing the government
                    that a private sector distribution system was more efficient, but by
                    demonstrating the damaging impact that their subsidy program was having on the
                    budget. Still, acknowledging that reality was slow and responding to the reality
                    also took time.</p>
                <p>Working iBangladesh as a development economist, I grew to understand better the
                    interdependency of professional disciplines and program management skills needed
                    to get the job done. The Mission Director in Bangladesh at the time we were
                    running this fertilizer program chose not to push the economic logic of lower
                    subsidies which he believed wouldn't resonate among our Bangladeshi
                    counterparts. Rather he made and won the case on financial and budgetary
                    grounds. Development assistance is more than just coming up with a better
                    economic rationale. It also has to connect at a level that produces the
                    political response and commitment that is needed to change attitudes and to make
                    things happen differently.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>CHURCH: Bangladesh at the time was part of what was called the Group of 77
                    nonaligneUnited Nations countries. The U.S. Embassy's agenda was securing
                    Bangladesh votes on United Nations issues of importance to U.S. interests. The
                    Embassy viewed our economic assistance and humanitarian relief work in that
                    context.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any of the cold war tensions affecting the

                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Thanks to the cold war, development assistance work in Bangladesh and
                    most of South Asia benefitted from large infusions of annual funding. After all,
                    the whole of Indochina was caught up in the aftermath of the Viet Nam war and
                    the fear of a widening regional conflict was always there. If there is one
                    problem we had, it was how to use the money wisely. The USAID program in
                    Bangladesh went from an annual $20 million program to a $100 million program in
                    development assistance alone, plus another $75 million in food aid, plus a
                    number of export credits. Combined with funds from other donors, Bangladesh was
                    receiving a half billion dollars at the end of the decade of the 1970s.</p>

                <p>CHURCH: Food relief, health, education and family planning programs, with some

                    food-for-work that built dikes, aquiculture ponds and irrigation canals. The
                    Asian Development Bank was putting money into road infrastructure, electric
                    power, and communications. The World Bank was providing a lot of large
                    infrastructure loans, hydroelectric dams, irrigation systems.</p>

                <p>CHURCH: As an economist, we viewed food aid with a little bit of skepticism
                    because we were fearful it would undermine food prices and discourage crop
                    production. Again the dependency question became important. But it also
                    provided, in some cases, some useful spinoffs. There were a number of food
                    assistance programs built around fish farms, for example. Fish farming became a
                    new enterprise, and the nontraditional food crop of Bangladesh became Tilapia, a
                    species of rapid reproducing and fast growing fish that originated in the Nile
                    region of Egypt. It became a very popular source of protein and food.</p>

                    perspective on development than Latin America. I learned that in settings like
                    Bangladesh to spur development you often must change more than economic
                    incentives; you must also change the way people act within the bureaucratic

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So let's go on to your next assignment. After Bangladesh
                        what was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: During my Bangladesh tour, I became acquainted with the agriculture
                    research programs that USAID and other donors were supporting through a group of
                    international agricultural research centers located around the world. Among the
                    14 centers at the time were the Corn and Maize Institute in Mexico (CIMMYT) and
                    the InternationaRice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines, two of the
                    centers at the heart of the “green revolution” of the 1960s. Both Centers had
                    scientific staff working in Bangladesh, and I became familiar with their work
                    through some of the farm survey work that I was conducting on my own for
                    USAID.</p>
                <p>So, at the end of my Bangladesh tour, I thought that as a change of pace and
                    before going on to another assignment, I would see if I could arrange to take a
                    year of study leave at IRRI in the Philippines. I was fortunate to be invited by
                    IRRI as a visiting scientist in its Agriculture Economics program. IRRI provided
                    me all of the logistic support of a house, a car, and 15 research staff to
                    manage while one of its own scientists was on his sabbatic leave in the U.S. At
                    the same time I was given the opportunity to pursue some research interests of
                    my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I directed farming systems research activities as part of an
                    interdisciplinary program run out of IRRI's economics department. The program
                    engaged social scientists along with agricultural engineers, plant breeders,
                    entomologists, and plant pathologists, all working on the goal of improving crop
                    production performance through applied research in farmers' fields. Some of
                    these same scientists working as a team helped develop the miracle “green
                    revolution” rices. IRRI was now attempting to spread the benefits of that effort
                    into more remote areas of Asia and to reach farmers that didn't have irrigation
                    and were dependent on rainfed cultivation. They were finding efforts to do so
                    were not as successful as with the irrigated varieties that offered
                    opportunities for more control over the rate of input application and the
                    management system.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>IRRI had developed a research outreach program which essentially conducted trials
                    and studies in farmers' fields with farmer participants and cooperators. IRRI
                    scientists either managed plots in farmers' fields or worked with volunteer
                    farmers who managed plots themselves using IRRI recommended seed varieties,
                    input levels or cultivation practices. The on-farm-trials program was in its
                    fourth year when I arrived at IRRI, and the first results were beginning to come
                    in. The objective was to explain the difference in yield outcomes between
                    farmer-managed operations and research station experimental plots. Also, we were
                    after answers to the question of what constrained farmers from adopting
                    cultivation methods that were demonstrated as superior in experiment station
                    trials.</p>
                <p>I had learned from my Bangladesh experience that farmers managed their time,
                    labor and draft animal power inputs to minimize risks when spread over the range
                    of separate fragmented plots of land they managed. When I arrived aIRRI the
                    Institute was starting to develop programs to train scientists from each of the
                    major rice growing countries in Asia and from parts of Africa and Latin America,
                    in how to conduct on-farm or farming systems research. I was invited to become
                    involved in building those training programs.</p>
                <p>It was one thing for the rice research scientists at an international center like
                    IRRI to conduct innovative on-farm experiments. It was an entirely different
                    thing to get research scientists in national programs interested and engaged in
                    doing this. As I mentioned, in Bangladesh one of the drawbacks of doing research
                    in farmers' fields was the lack of logistic support that research scientists
                    had. The funding to do research in farmer's fields, which required frequent
                    visits on a regular basis to monitor crop performance, was often insufficient.
                    This was the case in promote IRRI's on-farm research methodology in Nepal,
                    Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Bangladesh, and India.</p>
                <p>Essentially during my sabbatic year at IRRI, I was involved in two programs.
                    First, we attempted to pull together the proven on-farm research methods into
                    some training units and test them on visiting scientists from other Asian
                    countries. Secondly, we continued to gather further information on how better to
                    conduct on-farm research in the region.</p>
                <p>During that year I became better acquainted with IRRI's Director General, Nyle
                    Brady who had just been recruited by USAID to come to Washington and head up
                    what was then called the Bureau for Science and Technology. Earlier Dr. Brady
                    had arranged for me to spend a sabbatic year at the Rice Research Institute. He
                    wanted more USAID technical officers to become acquainted with the work of the
                    international agriculture research centers, so that they knew more about their
                    mandates, capabilities and, of course, funding requirements. He wanted “friends”
                    of the centers in USAID when it came budget time. Of course, USAID staff would
                    also have the opportunity to build their own technical skills while gaining a
                    better understanding of the Centers' work.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>At the time, USAID was contributing about $50 million a year to support
                    international research center programs. It was about a quarter of the nearly
                    $200 million that all bilateral and multilateral donors contributed each year to
                    the centers. The U.S. was by far the largest donor. Dr. Brady was aware that
                    USAID was periodically reexamining the levels at which the Agency should
                    continue its funding. Many in USAID wanted the centers to become sustainable
                    without donor assistance. Dr. Brady was a good bureaucrat as well as a good
                    scientist and knew he would need defenders against those that wanted to cut back
                    USAID funding for the centers before they were sustainable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the assumption that would make people think that
                        IRRI and the other international agriculture research centers could become
                        sustainable without U.S. support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Well, clearly most Asian countries were benefitting greatly with higher
                    food grain productivity using research results the centers were generating. Some
                    in USAID thought that these countries should shoulder a share of international
                    research center budgets and thaIndia, Indonesia, Thailand and The Philippines,
                    especially, could afford to pay a portion of IRRI's annual expenses now that
                    they were experiencing much greater food grain production, thanks to IRRI's
                    research findings. Over time, therefore, the original donor countries should be
                    able to scale back their support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that beginning to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Hardly. The developing countries in Asia benefitting from new agriculture
                    research were hard pressed to find enough funds to operate their own national
                    agriculture research and extension programs. And these national programs were
                    critical to getting international center research findings into farmers' fields
                    where they would have their payoff in higher rural incomes and greater food
                    production. Moreover, developing countries had a hard time attracting and
                    holding their own agricultural scientists and technicians and did not want to
                    see the international centers attract them away with the higher salaries and
                    benefits they could enjoy at places like IRRI. Some of the best scientists at
                    IRRI were Asian, and if they weren't at IRRI, they might be back in their own
                    countries contributing to their national programs. So there was a bit of
                    competition for scarce scientific talent between the national programs and
                    international centers. As a result, there were only modest contributions by the
                    Asian developing countries. The developing Asian countries could be expected to
                    cover only a very small share of IRRI expenses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find IRRI as a professional operation to work
                        at?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>CHURCH: IRRI is one of the best of its kind. Its scientists have very high
                    standards. They recognize the major risk they take when they release a rice
                    variety into the hands of tens of thousands of farmers. They're essentially
                    affecting people's lives, livelihood and risks of survival. There is one aspect
                    of research that is often neglected, and it is something that is not the
                    glamorous cutting edge aspect of the scientific world. It is what is called
                    “maintenance research.” It involves keeping ahead of the next generation of
                    plant pests and diseases, trying to improve crop tolerance to floods and
                    droughts. It is something that needs to be built into the ongoing research
                    process.</p>
                <p>So it's not just the quest for new knowledge that is important but also
                    maintaining the progress already achieved and not sliding backwards. If farmers
                    continued to use the same rice varieties indefinitely into the future, for
                    example, eventually genetic disintegration would set in. There is a constant
                    need to improve varietal selection, to sustain a more viable gene pool for cross
                    breeding purposes, and to be able to handle the challenges of breeding
                    resistance to the next generation of insect pests. So, all of these things are
                    an important part of the research environment. Really one could view the
                    international research centers not as something that benefits just the
                    developing world but, in fact, benefits the developed world as well.</p>
                <p>In fact one of the things we attempted to do when I came back to Washington after
                    my year at the International Rice Research Institute was to help Dr. Brady
                    demonstrate to the U.S. public and Congress that the research that goes on at
                    the centers benefits the United States as well as developing countries. The
                    centers warrant sustained U.S. support as an “investment” in our own future, not
                    just because they produce benefits abroad. The International Rice Research
                    Institute's first and foremost objective is to increase yields in developing
                    countries, stave off starvation, and keep ahead of population pressures. A
                    second goal of IRRI and the other international research centers is to provide
                    stability in the global grain food market, and that affects all of us.</p>
                <p>It was I think, an interesting experience after IRRI, helping make the case that
                    increased rice production and improved incomes in the developing world actually
                    benefits the United States by creating opportunities for trade with Asia which
                    was becoming a growing U.S. export market. By reducing the risk of hunger and
                    raising incomes and well-being, the green revolution spawned by the
                    international agriculture research centers helped create many thousands of Asian
                    buyers for U.S. products. So, in the longer run and larger scheme of things, I
                    advocate strong and sustained U.S. support for the international research
                    centers.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Something else about which most of the U.S. public is not aware, is the role that
                    IRRI and CIMMYT play as repositories for the world's genetic food grain
                    resources. IRRI and CIMMYT along with several of the other centers participate
                    along with the U.S., Japan and European countries in an International Treaty on
                    International Plant Genetic Resources administered by the FAO in Rome. Treaty
                    members coordinate the collection, labeling, storage, and maintaining of all of
                    the rice wheat and other food grain varieties around the world. Rice varieties
                    are warehoused at IRRI plus a couple of other locations. Wheat, maize, sorghum,
                    millet, bean and other seed varieties are maintained by other international or
                    national centers.</p>
                <p>Now, the genetic resources in those facilities are available to any country in
                    the world including the United States. Back when I was a research scientist at
                    IRRI, I often would rub shoulders in the Center's cafeteria with visiting
                    agricultural scientists from some of the large U.S. grain companies that
                    periodically sent representatives to take a look at what new varieties were
                    being developed.</p>
                <p>IRRI's first breakthrough for the green revolution was a cross between a
                    short-stemmed wild Chinese variety of rice and a long stemmed full grain variety
                    from Indonesia. It was those two varieties that launched the green revolution.
                    Those parent seeds are now part of that collection of what is now I believe over
                    50,000 rice seed varieties that are housed at the Rice Research Institute. Those
                    are the kinds of things I think a USAID development officer is not really
                    unaware of until there is a chance to be part of that research environment. So,
                    the year that USAID gave me to work at the International Rice Research Institute
                    and to experience this type of activity first hand was an extremely rewarding
                    and broadening one that later proved valuable in helping get the message out to
                    the broader U.S. community that things the Agency has supported over the years
                    were producing benefits not only for the developing world but also for the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about farming systems research. It's my
                        understanding that farming systems research looks at farm entities in their
                        totality and at the interactions of all their production activities. I
                        recall that farming systems research was in some disrepute; people were
                        challenging it as not effective because it was so difficult to carry out in
                        developing country settings. What is your thinking?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CHURCH: Farming systems research does indeed examine the way farmers organize
                    their activities and as a result certainly requires more time, skills and
                    resources than single commodity research. But in Asia there is really little
                    other choice given that farms generally involve several crop and livestock
                    enterprises. At IRRI, of course, the focus was on rice-based farming systems but
                    using a farming systems approach, scientists examined constraints on rice
                    production that were not just inherent in the crop itself but also in the
                    commitments a farmer had to other enterprises or activities he managed. They
                    looked for ways a farmer could boost yields on the land most appropriate for
                    rice, while freeing up other land to diversify into other crops and livestock
                    enterprises. That requires taking into account how other crops compete for labor
                    at the planting or harvesting times of rice, what added demands there are for
                    inputs when cash is scarce, for draft animal use. The farmer has only so many
                    hours he can work and manage his farm. Changes in his farm system must be
                    examined with that reality in mind.</p>
                <p>So, that means going back to the research scientists at the station and saying,
                    hey, if we are going to improve rice yields on this farmer's land and introduce
                    a second crop, we need to come up with a rice variety that could be planted,
                    say, earlier in the crop year so that he has time to tend to the other crops on
                    land no longer needed for rice. Or alternatively, there may be an early maturing
                    rice variety or one that does well when another crop is inter-planted. Answers
                    to those research questions will identify realistic options for increasing total
                    production and income on the farmer's land.</p>
                <p>This kind of farming systems research requires establishing a partnership with
                    farmers who become directly involved in the scientific research itself by
                    managing scientist directed trials and giving feedback about what works for them
                    and why. Farming systems research is much more pragmatic than experiment station
                    research. The limitation of farming systems research is its very labor intensive
                    demands on research scientists. It requires the training and equipping of a very
                    large staff of energetic and committed scientists with the resources to get off
                    the station and work with farmers.</p>
                <p>Many developing country governments, however, don't have the budgets or staff to
                    conduct research trials in farmers' fields. I can recall bouncing around the
                    countryside for sometimes a half a day to get to one farmer's field where
                    research trials had been set up. Well, you can't cover many plots when you are
                    doing that. As a result you can only set up a few field trials which reduces the
                    statistical reliability in your research findings. Thus there are some limits to
                    how sound the research results will be even if the conditions more closely
                    approximate reality than do those on research station plots. The tradeoff
                    between real world settings and statistical reliability of research results is
                    clear.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Moreover, research and development biases can creep into farming systems
                    research. For example, it is not unusual to find that farming systems research
                    scientists tend to gravitate to those farmers that are slightly better off, the
                    ones that can invite them in for tea or give them a bed for the night or feed
                    them, this sort of thing. They set up their experimental plots on the land of
                    better-off but not representative farmers of the regions where they are working.
                    As a result the better-off farmers reap a disproportionate share of the benefits
                    of farming systems research. The outcome is that research does not always
                    benefit the poorest who need it the most. So, the farming systems research
                    method is prone to introducing biases against some of those farmers who could
                    benefit the most.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a range of disciplines I suppose. It is not just one
                        researcher.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Farming systems research not only gets research scientists into the
                    farmer's fields, but also gets geneticists talking to plant engineers talking to
                    economists talking to plant pathologists, etc. That works at a major
                    international research center with a critical mass of scientists. But in
                    developing Asian countries, the farming systems research method places a lot of
                    demands on the few available scientists and limited research budgets with which
                    they have to work.</p>
                <p>There has always been interest in trying to improve farming systems research
                    methods, but there have been some serious questions about its appropriateness
                    for developing country research systems. It is often viewed as a luxury approach
                    to research as opposed to the more pragmatic, day-to-day research that generally
                    goes on in a developing country context. I am a firm believer that it works.
                    I've seen it work. I've seen the enthusiasm of participating farmers, but I'm
                    also aware that there are some biases toward the spread of the benefits that
                    farming systems research can generate, and there are some definite limits on the
                    capacity of such programs to deliver in resource scarce developing
                    countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any more you want to add about the year at IRRI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Well, I recommend that USAID technical staff consider seeking a similar
                    experience at some point in their careers to get a perspective on their work
                    from a totally different institutional setting. My “sabbatic leave” year at IRRI
                    was very rewarding from that standpoint. It reinforced a number of things that I
                    had come to believe but was maybe a little too timid about expressing or
                    promoting. The experience also introduced me to new development issues that
                    helped guide me during the second half of my USAID career. I'm glad the
                    opportunity came along and that I chose it rather than come back directly to
                    Washington, DC after 12 years overseas.</p>
                <p>Assignment to the Bureau for Science and Technology in USAID/Washington
                    (1981-87)</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you left IRRI in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I left IRRI in the fall of 1981, in time to get our kids in school in the
                    Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC. where we had bought a home a few
                    years earlier. My wife, Connie, and I had started a family overseas. Our son,
                    John, was born in 1973, and our daughter, Adriana, was born in 1976, both in
                    Guatemala. They were young children in Bangladesh and the Philippines, and while
                    they got very good schooling overseas, they called themselves “Americans” but
                    had yet to live in the United States. They needed some cultural roots of their
                    own. It was finally time for us to come back to the U.S. as a family for
                    awhile.</p>
                <p>And for me, the USAID personnel computers revealed that after 12 years in the
                    field, I was due for a tour in Washington, DC; what we overseas referred to as
                    the Agency's only true hardship post! We still would miss living abroad. Aside
                    from all the opportunities to travel that overseas living offered, we could also
                    enjoy a worry-free home life thanks to all the support that the USAID and
                    Embassy administrative services provided in housing, furnishings, medical and
                    other logistic support. Overseas we also enjoyed the luxury of having domestic
                    help at home. (I can report as a father I have raised two kids without having to
                    change a single diaper thanks to the domestic help we had in places like
                    Bangladesh and Guatemala.)</p>
                <p>My wife had started a correspondence course in accounting while we were in
                    Bangladesh. She was a history major from Stanford University, and it really
                    didn't give her a lot of career options abroad. She did have a number of part
                    time jobs as a spouse in Bangladesh and in the Philippines, but really felt she
                    wanted more of a career of her own. So for her, coming back to the United States
                    was a opportunity to get some formal accounting course work at George Washington
                    University in the District and obtain a CPA [certified public accountant] and
                    then a masters degree of Accounting during the period we were back in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your USAID assignment in Washington, DC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I headed up the Agriculture Policy Division of the Office of Agriculture
                    in USAID's Bureau of Science and Technology. I had essentially two large
                    projects to oversee with a staff of six development economists. One that was
                    already in place was a global farming systems research support project
                    implemented by the University of Florida. The project aimed to spread the
                    farming systems research “gospel” to other USAID country programs, particularly
                    in Africa and Latin America. The other was a new economic policy reform project
                    initiative to support USAID country programs aimed at getting governments out of
                    intervening in agriculture markets with subsidies and price controls.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The two projects built very nicely on my personal overseas experience. They also
                    were very complementary. For example, USAID evaluations were revealing that it
                    was futile to put money into agricultural research, if there were price controls
                    that discouraged the very crop production that the research supported. In some
                    cases, which really alarmed us from an environmental standpoint, we found
                    farmers were removing forests on steeper and steeper hillsides because
                    subsidized fertilizer made it profitable to cultivate these marginal lands.
                    However, with the trees removed, the hillsides were subject to erosion and the
                    lower valley irrigation systems were filling up with silt from that erosion.
                    Subsidized inputs were promoting agricultural practices that were degrading the
                    environment and were not sustainable. Working in Washington provided the
                    opportunity to bring together two themes in my career, sound market incentives
                    and appropriate agricultural technologies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The policy project, where was it the most active and what
                        were the most important breakthroughs you felt you were able to accomplish
                        for the project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The major challenge in the policy area was demonstrating convincingly the
                    consequences of pursuing policies that actually were counterproductive. I
                    mentioned earlier fertilizer subsidies in Bangladesh. That certainly was one.
                    Price controls on basic food crops were a second concern. Many developing
                    countries feared that without controls, the prices of urban food supplies would
                    soar. More than one government has fallen by popular protests over rising bread
                    prices. Our challenge was to show that relaxing price controls would increase
                    incentives to produce more, which in turn would act to dampen the effects of any
                    price increases in the long run.</p>
                <p>Most of USAID's economic policy work in agriculture was directed toward input
                    pricing issues: low interest rates on farm credit, subsidized prices for
                    chemical fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation water. There were three goals
                    there. One was a fiscal goal to keep governments solvent by reducing
                    budget-busting subsidies. A second goal was to provide resources to assure
                    efficient input delivery. For example, free water often meant that irrigation
                    systems weren't maintained for lack of operating revenue, and cheap credit meant
                    that rural banks eventually went bankrupt and closed down because they could not
                    cover their operating costs from their small interest rate spreads. Third, was
                    the goal of equity. Subsidized fertilizer, for example, most often went not to
                    poorer remote farmers but to the richest farmers with the most local power and
                    influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular country where you found this receptive or
                        was it hard to tell?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CHURCH: Our challenge was first to educate USAID field missions to these
                    realities, then to help them win over their developing country counterparts. In
                    many cases, USAID missions were taking the expedient approach of helping
                    governments subsidize fertilizer or credit to get farmers to use them. While
                    this produced some results in the short run, it was not sustainable over time,
                    nor did it reach some of the most needy of farmers. I will grant that it is hard
                    to distinguish between the impact of our project and the impact of budget
                    realities, but either way, these inputs are subsidized much less today than in
                    the past. And governments now have in place the capacity to better assess just
                    who is benefitting from these services and who isn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have an example of those things that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I pointed already to the Bangladesh fertilizer experience. There were
                    others: reduced use of subsidized credit in the Dominican Republic where USAID
                    introduced a graduation scheme for moving farmers to commercial borrowing; in
                    Indonesia USAID participated with other donors in promoting integrated pest
                    management (IPM) as an alternative to unchecked use of subsidized
                    pesticides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find were the principal reasons or factors
                        that worked against making these policy changes in agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: A lack of clear information to determine cause and effect certainly was a
                    factor. USAID has not really invested much in measuring the impact of the policy
                    changes that its programs have fostered, particularly in agriculture. USAID
                    mission staffs were rewarded for how fast they could get program money obligated
                    and funding pipelines drawn down. Less recognition is given to what programs
                    have accomplished, partly a result of the fact that by the time impact is
                    evidenced most mission staff have moved on to other country assignments. So,
                    little time and attention is given to gathering baseline data and monitoring the
                    progress of projects in terms of the impact on participants. This is one of the
                    things the policy project attempted to do... to measure and document some of our
                    program accomplishments. We funded case studies of particular initiatives that
                    USAID had implemented over the years to determine just how much of an impact
                    they had. We made up for the fact that most agriculture projects seldom included
                    sufficient funds to benchmark and track the impact of their activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>We weren't always popular for the conclusions we reached from these impact
                    surveys. It's never easy to tell a USAID project officer his or her program is
                    not producing desired results, or worse, that it is further aggravating the
                    situation because, say, big and rich not small and poor farmers may be
                    benefitting most from our support. We comforted ourselves, though, in knowing
                    that we were helping to make it harder for people to make bad decisions. Of
                    course, USAID funded programs for political, often “cold war,” reasons at the
                    time. At least we could help those making such decisions by demonstrating what
                    economic and social costs of such programs might be. As a result, I think we did
                    prevent some bad decisions from being made, and we did stop USAID from dumping
                    money into some of these programs that were not sustainable, that were not
                    reaching intended beneficiaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also directed USAID's global farming systems research
                        program. Approaching it on a global basis, is there anything particularly
                        different about its characteristics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: One thing I found interesting was the receptivity to the farming systems
                    research methodology in Africa. It was not all that popular in Latin America,
                    perhaps because the region already had more developed, and somewhat entrenched,
                    research establishments in place. In Africa, where research systems were less
                    mature, farming systems approaches appeared more welcome. Also, in Africa there
                    is no dominant crop in many settings. So, as a necessity you almost had to
                    address a variety of farm crop and livestock enterprises in order to have any
                    impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have some examples or instances where it took

                <p>CHURCH: You see it more in East Africa in places like Kenya, in Malawi, in
                    Zambia, where agriculture research programs are built almost exclusively around
                    a farming systems approach. It certainly isn't widespread among developing
                    countries, but where there has been a concerted effort over a sustained period
                    of time, I think it has led to an entirely new type of institutional framework
                    that probably will prevail. But in Africa, agricultural research, like most
                    development efforts, takes a long time to evolve into something substantive and
                    sustainable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other particular lessons or themes that
                        have come out of farming system research work apart from those we have
                        already talked about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CHURCH: Well, my sense is that the Agency, in its current configuration with
                    smaller staffs and more limited budgets, could do better by pursuing these kinds
                    of agricultural research initiatives through already existing international
                    frameworks like the international agriculture research centers. I would argue
                    that sustaining an international research network to carry out some of these
                    programs in developing countries is probably more effective than attempting to
                    mount these kinds of initiatives independently in every country where USAID has
                    field missions. We might provide some country level support through training
                    grants to send people to the centers for skills upgrading and to integrate our
                    U.S. land grant agricultural universities into the global research system. I'd
                    even encourage USAID to leave logistic support for vehicles, equipment, etc., to
                    the international banks to fund. I think USAID is probably better positioned to
                    support agriculture policy work than it is to work in food crop production
                    technology development and dissemination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your work with farming systems research over the years,
                        were there any common findings from the research or lessons that stood out
                        for you no matter where you did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: Farming systems research is very site specific. That is perhaps the only
                    common theme right there. Research must be tailored to the particular setting
                    and resources. In my view farmers, even poor farmers, apply their own version of
                    the scientific method of hypothesis testing. They constantly test to see if new
                    seed or different cultivation practices work better than before. We don't give
                    small farmers the credit they are due in their roles as “applied scientists.”
                    The only difference is they must live from their experiments. Farming systems
                    research, where I've seen it applied systematically and conscientiously, has
                    achieved significant returns through farmer involvement in the process. It takes
                    a longer time to get reliable results and the results may be very location
                    specific. Still, while scientists could double crop yields in experiment station
                    trials in less than half the time than to do so in farmers fields, there is no
                    guarantee that experiment station results will work as well in the real farming
                    world.</p>
                <p>There are a number of benefits from this approach. It gives the researcher a
                    better understanding of the realities of farming. It also gives farmers a more
                    immediate opportunity to draw on and respond to what works and what doesn't
                    work. Granted, it may slow down the research process and introduce a lot of
                    variables that make it hard for a scientist to talk about the qualities of a new
                    variety or a new practice. Application of the scientific method to field trials
                    is also more complicated in a real world setting. It may draw out the results,
                    but at the same time you may get a better product. So there is a trade off
                    there, time versus reliability versus reality.</p>

                <p>The willingness of a donor agency like USAID to stay the course is also
                    important. If a donor is not willing to support this type of research activity
                    for at least a couple of decades, it should not begin in the first place. USAID
                    and other bilateral and multilateral donors have funded an impressive
                    international agricultural research and genetic resources infrastructure out of
                    the green revolution and fears of global famine in the 1950s and 1960s. It is a
                    system that has proven that it works. It warrants continued support. There
                    should be a clear awareness that these programs are essential to global survival
                    to assure that we have the best knowledge to meet the next challenges to come be
                    it a new generation of crop disease or pest or changed environmental
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>On detail with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (1987-88)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your USAID tour in Washington offer any other
                        experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: During the last year of my Washington tour I arranged a detail from the
                    Agency to another branch of the U.S. government, the Office of the U.S. Trade
                    Representative (USTR) in the Executive Office of the President. The USAID
                    Administrator at the time, Alan Woods, had just come from the USTR and was
                    looking for representation by someone from USAID, who had developing country
                    experience, to serve on the United States delegation to the General Agreement on
                    Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in the “Uruguay Round” of trade negotiations. The
                    United States was attempting to exercise some leadership in the negotiations on
                    agriculture trade and sought developing country support. Unlike any of the
                    previous trade negotiation rounds which were very much oriented toward
                    industrialized countries and trade in industrial goods, the Uruguay round had a
                    much broader, more ambitious agenda. The negotiations were expanded to involve
                    developing countries in a major way for the first time. In addition to
                    industrial goods, the negotiations also took on trade in agricultural
                    commodities and services as well as trade related investment measures and
                    intellectual property rights. In agriculture, besides tariff and other trade
                    restrictions, domestic subsidies and production controls were on the
                    negotiators' agenda.</p>
                <p>The U.S. objective was to assure that the negotiations did, indeed, address
                    phasing out domestic policies which the U.S. government argued led to
                    distortions in agricultural trade. The agricultural negotiations were dominated
                    by surplus-producing countries in the European Community and the United States
                    and by countries which heavily protected their farmers like Japan. The United
                    States wanted to gain developing countries as our allies in its efforts to
                    remove price supports in foreign markets where it felt American farmers could
                    compete. The U.S. team needed help in communicating its concerns to the
                    developing country GATT member, whose votes it sought in crafting a final GATT
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CHURCH: I put together initial draft procedures for how the U.S. negotiators
                    should recognize the special interests of developing countries in any agreement
                    to phase out trade tariffs and domestic subsidies. Agriculture was one of the
                    more contentious issues in the negotiations. Resolving domestic policy issues
                    was a key element for a successful GATT Uruguay Round negotiation. Working in
                    the USTR provided me an opportunity to communicate the special concerns of the
                    developing countries to members of the U.S. negotiating team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main issues that you faced in that
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The main issues we faced were what should be on the bargaining table and
                    what should not. This was the first time that international agreements would
                    essentially intrude upon what were considered domestic issues and national
                    sovereignty. Many GATT member countries had expressed concern that opening the
                    door to domestic price policies would involve further erosion of sovereignty
                    among a number of trading partners. Recognizing the link between domestic
                    agricultural support policies and international trade was, I think, a major
                    education process. We spent a lot of our time building our case meeting with
                    American farm commodity producers' associations to win their endorsement for the
                    U.S. negotiating position.</p>
                <p>We also invested a great deal of time building a case to demonstrate the U.S.
                    position that a liberalized agricultural trading system offered benefits to all
                    participating countries. This presented a tremendous measurement challenge
                    because we were not only seeking to calculate the distributive benefits - how
                    much each trading country gains in the short- run from more open markets, but
                    also the dynamic benefits of more efficient long-run production resulting from a
                    liberalized trading system.</p>
                <p>The short-run distributive gains are rather straightforward. If tariffs are
                    eliminated, one can compute the benefits as value of the resulting increased
                    trade at the new set of prices. It is a onetime gain from removing trade
                    distortions and allowing the market to allocate production and consumption where
                    new prices dictate.</p>
                <p>The other longer term gain from trade is more difficult to measure. The removal
                    of tariff barriers and subsidies also encourage new investments in agricultural
                    production in the most competitive countries and consequently a more rapid
                    growth in global trade than would occur under a more restricted trade regime.
                    That added benefit from more efficient global markets and from more productive
                    investments produces still further benefits in the longer run by putting
                    international agricultural trade on a higher growth path. That is a very
                    difficult concept both to measure and to communicate to essentially nontechnical
                    political decision makers involved in the trade negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Bear in mind that developing countries obtain a large share of their annual
                    budget revenues from the duties they charge on imports and exports, and we were
                    asking them to remove these duties as part of their participation in the
                    process. They did not have in place alternative measures like an income tax that
                    could take up the slack. Still, we could show that it was self-defeating to
                    charge duties on imports and then turn around and give that revenue as subsidies
                    to producers when a country could get rid of those duties and get rid of the
                    subsidies without making its fiscal house any worse off. Plus there would be the
                    benefit of providing a more efficient set of market price incentives that would
                    lead to more productive use of resources and a more competitive position in
                    domestic and international markets.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the negotiations come out? Were you involved in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I moved back overseas with USAID before the Uruguay Round trade
                    negotiations were completed. From an overseas perspective, it was apparent that
                    while few questioned our arguments, some doubted the reliability of some of our
                    numbers. A GATT agreement finally was reached to reduce domestic subsidies and
                    production controls over a number of years but understandably it was more modest
                    than the aspirations of the U.S. negotiating team. I think we did engender
                    strong interest in both government and academic circles to gather better data to
                    assess the impact of trade liberalization that is taking place as a result of
                    the agreement. Without better statistics we are at a loss to determine the
                    impact of agricultural trade liberalization on job and income growth and on
                    overall productivity in GATT member countries.</p>
                <p>Like my sabbatic leave at IRRI, my detail to the U.S. Trade Representative's
                    Office was a rewarding and intellectually broadening experience. I don't know
                    any other Agency of the federal government that provides such opportunities for
                    its staff. I was very fortunate to work out those two arrangements to broaden my
                    perspective on economic development.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CHURCH: Following my detail to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, I was
                    again eligible for an overseas assignment. This time I needed an assignment to
                    an overseas USAID post where there was a high school for our kids, work
                    opportunities for my wife, and, of course a career challenge for me. I found
                    that as I progressed through my foreign service career with the Agency and
                    through raising a family at home, I was encountering a situation that confronts
                    a lot of us as development assistance specialists: a growing tension between
                    professional and personal goals. My kids were getting more and more settled into
                    the United States setting and were reluctant to go overseas. My wife had
                    finished her own CPA studies and had a nice job. Our parents were aging and
                    wanted to be close to their grand children. We were pretty much settled into
                    stateside living, and there were a lot of reasons to stay put in the U.S. It was
                    a little hard to go overseas again.It's unfortunate to hear myself say that
                    because here I was career-wise at the peak of my professional capabilities, with
                    a broad understanding of development concepts, good field experience with what
                    works and what doesn't work. It's probably the best time in the world to be
                    overseas from the standpoint of contributions a seasoned development officer can
                    make. But, from a family standpoint it was probably the most difficult time
                    given the age of our kids and the career interests of my wife. Where development
                    officers are needed most is in the poorest countries. But those are precisely
                    the countries that lack adequate schools and have the fewest job opportunities
                    for spouses, and very often where USAID has smaller missions with less technical
                    positions in agriculture, health, education, etc. The developing world becomes
                    pretty small when mid-career USAID officers require a post with a high school
                    for their kids and job opportunities for their spouse.</p>
                <p>The USAID Afghanistan program in Pakistan at the time offered a way of meeting
                    all those needs for our family. The U.S. government was helping a rebel
                    government in exile in Pakistan prepare itself to return to what was
                    Soviet-occupied territory. The Soviet Union had pulled its troops out of
                    Afghanistan, but fighting continued between forces of the puppet regime they
                    left behind and the muhajideen freedom fighters of the Afghan resistance
                    movement that the West continued to support. The country was strewn with land
                    mines and its damaged road, power and irrigation infrastructure combined to make
                    development work very difficult. It wasn't possible for “official” Americans to
                    go into the country so the program had to be run out of Islamabad, Peshawar, and
                    Quetta in Pakistan. Still in retrospect, working in Pakistan on the Afghan
                    relief and rehabilitation program turned out to be a good choice. Pakistan's
                    capital, Islamabad, where we were based had one of the best international
                    overseas high schools among USAID assisted countries. My wife had opportunities
                    to work for other USAID contractors, and the Afghan program certainly was unique
                    and challenging.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I was Deputy Director of the Afghan Agriculture Program Office and
                    responsible for running a program to smuggle wheat seed and fertilizer into
                    Afghanistan to help resettle areas of the country under Afghan “muhajideen”
                    rebel control.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The Afghan program was very small. We had about 12 USAID American staff
                    and an equal number of local contractors and consultants. But we covered just
                    about all the development sectors — agriculture, heath, education,
                    infrastructure building. Those of us engaged in the agriculture program focused
                    on getting Afghan food crop production restored again. We bought seed and
                    fertilizer on the world market had it shipped to port in Pakistan and warehoused
                    in Karachi. We then engaged truckers to move it to the Afghan border where it
                    was off loaded into smaller vehicles, or in some cases pack animals, and carted
                    across the mountains through the historically infamous Khyber Pass into
                    Afghanistan to be sold to farmers who were trying to reestablish their former
                    way of life after more than a decade of fighting in the Afghan resistance. We
                    also had programs to supply food to workers restoring roads, bridges and
                    irrigation systems that were critical to get commercial life going again in
                    rural areas. Because most of the draft animals had been killed, we also had a
                    program to bring in breeding livestock.</p>
                <p>Many of the Afghan farmers we were trying to reach were in their mid twenties and
                    had left farm families when they were young boys of 14-15 years to pick up a gun
                    to fight in the “muhajideen” resistance forces against the occupying Soviet
                    forces. They had been driven from their villages and really had lost most of
                    their farming skills during more than a decade of resistance struggles. These
                    younger Afghans not only needed to get seed and fertilizer but also know-how to
                    get crops growing. Orchard crops like raisins and grapes, cumin and spices that
                    were grown in the country required several seasons to be reestablished after
                    being abandoned by the war. But Afghans needed to eat in the meantime, so our
                    emphasis was on food crop production. In 1988 after the Soviets pulled out, more
                    than 4 million Afghans, mostly women and children were still sheltered in
                    refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran waiting to return. United Nations agencies
                    and other donor programs could not sustain them indefinitely. Our job was to get
                    food crops planted so entire families could return home and rebuild their lives.
                    We really did not have much time to think about development. We were part of a
                    huge multi-donor humanitarian relief and rehabilitation effort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could you manage a program not being in the country,
                        or did you visit the country?</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>CHURCH: Our programs operated out of two Pakistani towns, Peshawar and Quetta
                    which bordered Afghanistan. Our staffs were Afghan, many well educated, skilled
                    and “westernized” who were gravitating back to the area and were anxious to see
                    some sort of peace and prosperity return. We recruited and hired many of them to
                    implement USAID programs. We expected many of them would make up a future Afghan
                    government. So in a way we were supporting a government in exile that was
                    implementing USAID programs as well as programs for other donors. The Ministry
                    of Health, for example, consisted of two nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
                    who hired all the Afghan staff that USAID hoped would soon return to
                    Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and form the public agencies of a new democratic
                    government.</p>
                <p>One of the challenges we faced was coordinating all of the donor assistance and
                    all of the NGOs to get some semblance of organization out of the program. Too
                    often, donors and NGOs ended up hiring qualified Afghans from each other. The
                    USAID Afghan program was unique in that USAID was just one player and often not
                    the dominant player among many donor and humanitarian relief groups assisting
                    the Afghan population. One of the largest players was the United Nations High
                    Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) which attempted to coordinate and deliver
                    support to the two million Afghans in Pakistani refugee camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the expectation when you were working there, of
                        where this would evolve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: In 1988 when I arrived the U.S. government anticipated that within a year
                    after the Soviets pulled out, the puppet regime would soon collapse and a
                    pro-western transition government would be established that would welcome
                    assistance programs back into the country. (Remember USAID had conducted a full
                    development assistance program in Afghanistan since the early 1960s and up to
                    the mid 1970s when the Soviets invaded and occupied the country.) So USAID was
                    positioning itself in Pakistan to return to Kabul and help rebuild the
                    country.</p>
                <p>We had equipment and staff standing by in temporarily rented facilities in
                    Pakistan running programs in exile while waiting for that moving date to come.
                    After three years and what turned out to be an intervening evacuation from
                    Pakistan by our families during the Gulf War, I decided that there really wasn't
                    much chance for such an Afghan assistance program any time soon, so I chose to
                    move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with members of the Afghan
                        government in exile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The Afghan exile government attempted to distribute the various
                    ministerial responsibilities among the different feuding factions that existed
                    in the country. Each faction came from a different area of Afghanistan. Each had
                    lost a number of lives to the Russians in its struggle to expel the Soviet
                    forces. It turned out that the Minister of Agriculture with whom we had to work
                    was a very fundamentalist Muslim cleric with very little agricultural
                    background. While we gave him support and recognition for the title he held, we
                    had to conduct our programs through more informal means. . One of my
                    responsibilities was setting up a system for monitoring what went on inside the
                    country. We had both a high tech and a low tech approach. We were using very
                    simple survey questionnaires at the outset, which were administered by a few
                    Afghans we trained to gather the data. In some cases they were Afghan Americans
                    that we felt were trustworthy enough to be able to vouch for what they saw. We
                    sent them in with Polaroid cameras and cassette recorders to walk into the
                    villages and look and see if they could find the bags of fertilizer with the
                    USAID handclasp on them. We had them take pictures of wheat fields, of roads, of
                    crops being planted and harvested as evidence that the seed and fertilizer were
                    being used the way we intended.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>We also set up one of the first high tech “geographic information system” (GIS)
                    entering data into computerized digital maps from a series of satellite images
                    that we were able to obtain from the French and from one of our closest allies
                    in this program, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who had
                    been remotely monitoring Russian movements inside Afghanistan for a number of
                    years. The satellite maps had many good images of damaged infrastructure and
                    areas in which there were crops in the crop land. We were able to get that
                    imagery and convert it into computerized maps. We use these maps to track
                    inventory in basically a spatial data base to keep track of and monitor changes
                    that were occurring as a result of what we were sending into the country.</p>
                <p>Surveys, satellite maps and GIS software became the tools we used for monitoring
                    USAID development assistance inside a country where physically we could not set
                    foot. I was impressed to see how easy it was to train Afghans to use
                    sophisticated satellite imagery and calculate, from hand- held global
                    positioning system (GPS) units, their positions inside Afghanistan to report
                    what were physical conditions on the ground. The Afghans we were able to recruit
                    for the program definitely had solid technical skills. Of course, it was very
                    encouraging and exciting to see Afghan exiles, American Afghans, French Afghans,
                    all of the Afghans that had been spread around the world during the Soviet
                    occupation, joining efforts to try to bring the country back together again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the program useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: It was the right program but not the right time for it. The Soviet puppet
                    regime in Afghanistan proved more resilient than expected - though it eventually
                    did fall - and the more fundamentalist leaders of the Afghan resistance proved
                    to be too divided. As for the USAID staff itself, we got caught up in events
                    from another part of the world when, as a precaution during the Gulf War,
                    American families were evacuated from all Muslim countries including, of course,
                    Pakistan. We brought our families back to the United States, found temporary
                    housing and attempted to run the program even more remotely from Washington, DC
                    for nearly a year. My son at that particular time was applying to college. He
                    was in his senior year. He wanted to finish high school back here in the United
                    States. When we were allowed to return to post, I ended up leaving my family in
                    the United States, going back to Afghanistan for a few months, closing out our
                    personal affairs, and moving back to join them.</p>
                <p>It was apparent USAID would not be going back into Afghanistan any time soon.
                    Fortunately, many of the NGOs were taking more of a central leadership role in
                    our programs and doing very well with very little USAID supervision. USAID
                    essentially decided to wind down its efforts in Pakistan as much for lack of
                    progress in Afghanistan as for lack of Pakistani cooperation with the U.S. on
                    issues related to narcotics interdiction and nuclear non- proliferation. So, it
                    became a situation where the United States wanted to have a much reduced
                    presence in the area.</p>

                <p>Assignment to USAID's Office of Evaluation in Washington D(1991-1995)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that you came back to the U.S. What year was that?
                        What was your assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I returned to the Unites States in the fall of 1991, about a year after
                    the Gulf War ended. During the evacuation period when I was working in
                    Washington, D.C., I learned about USAID's plans to expand the Agency's
                    evaluation work under the Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination (PPC). John
                    Erickson at that time had just come in from the field where he was Mission
                    Director in Thailand and Sri Lanka I believe, to take over PPC's Center for
                    Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE). He was interested in building
                    USAID's capacity for conducting global impact evaluations of country programs in
                    an effort to distill lessons that the Agency might learn from nearly 30 years of
                    overseas economic development assistance work. He offered me a position in
                    CDIE's evaluation office heading up a new series of impact assessments of Agency
                    environmental programs.</p>
                <p>So I came back to Washington where I spent the last five years of my USAID
                    career. In retrospect, it was a good way to wind up an interesting 25 years of
                    USAID international development work. There aren't many who have the opportunity
                    to spend the last few years of their career in the Foreign Service reflecting on
                    some of the broader development challenges.</p>
                <p>In all my years in USAID, I never worked in what I call the last step of the
                    project cycle - evaluation. Anybody who comes into the agency understands that
                    the Agency works through projects. In its simplest form, the project cycle has
                    four steps: 1) analysis of the problem; 2) design of an intervention to correct
                    the problem; 3) implementation of a program to solve the problem; and, 4)
                    evaluation of the results.</p>
                <p>We actually organize a lot of our daily living around this project model without
                    being aware of it. When I've trained new development officers in project
                    management, I have used the example of going to the movies. Whenever we go to
                    the movies we first look at the papers and decide what movies are playing, where
                    and at what time. That's Step #1, information gathering and analysis. Then we
                    came up with a plan — who's going, in whose car at what time, dinner before or
                    after, etc. That's Step #2, design and development of a plan. Then we put that
                    plan into practice; we go to the movie and dinner and enjoy ourselves. That's
                    Step #3, implementation of the plan. Afterwards, we sit and talk about the
                    evening - did we really enjoy the movie; was it too crowded at the time we went,
                    could we have gone at a different hour at a cheaper price for a better seat,
                    etc.. That's Step #4, evaluation. The project cycle is something we do
                    unconsciously on a day-to-day basis, and in development work we do it the same
                    way on a much larger scale.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>USAID evaluation work is really fascinating. It's applied research.
                    Unfortunately, USAID project evaluation, because it is left till last, is too
                    often left out of project work altogether. When I arrived in USAID's evaluation
                    office, the Agency was getting serious about better evaluation of the impact of
                    its programs partly because Congress was pressing USAID to demonstrate that
                    foreign aid dollars were producing results. Accountability was becoming a key
                    concern across the entire federal government and particularly in U.S. foreign
                    assistance programs. The disintegration of the centrally planned economies of
                    Central Europe and the breakup of the Soviet Union had removed the pretext for
                    giving money to developing countries to win friends in the “cold war.” As we
                    moved into the decade of the '90s, we found a great deal more attention was
                    being focused on whether our programs were having an impact on intended
                    beneficiaries - were crop yields and farm incomes increasing and for whom as a
                    result of our assistance. So USAID needed to come up with much sounder and
                    objectively obtained evidence of the impact of its programs.</p>
                <p>Project and program evaluations became a very critical component of development
                    assistance activities in the 1990s. It was a fascinating time. There was so much
                    more information available about the impact of USAID programs than when I joined
                    the Agency two decades earlier. First, however, we had to come up with a sounder
                    evaluation methodology than the Agency had employed in the past, partly because
                    we were being asking more difficult and pointed questions. For example, the
                    question of attribution - the extent to which we could trace a change back to
                    assistance provided by the U.S. government through USAID - was complicated by
                    the fact that the Agency was not the only donor in many country programs. To
                    what extent could we find USAID's fingerprints on programs in which the Agency
                    was only one partner?</p>
                <p>Another issue was the question of effectiveness. Did USAID pursue the best
                    approach in coming up with a result? Could it have saved money or time by
                    pursuing another course of action? For example, USAID programs to encourage food
                    production offer several strategies for achieving that goal - investing in
                    research and technology, funding production credits, training extension workers,
                    encouraging better market pricing policies. But which is the most cost effective
                    way in a particular setting? The last few years I was with USAID, I had an
                    opportunity to contribute evaluation methodologies to measure results and
                    document the Agency's experience for future generations of development
                    assistance officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe a couple of those evaluation studies and how you
                        carried them out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>CHURCH: We started off by looking at programs in what we called “sustainable
                    agriculture”, that is, small farm assistance programs that wouldn't lead to
                    environmental degradation. For example, USAID's subsidized fertilizer programs
                    in the past had made farming marginal lands profitable. But the result often was
                    cultivation on hillsides that were prone to erosion and in the long-run to lower
                    crop yields. Such agricultural programs were not sustainable. We conducted
                    several evaluation case studies of more sustainable approaches to food
                    production that USAID had sponsored. We looked at programs in the Philippines,
                    The Gambia, Mali, Jamaica, Thailand, Sri Lanka for answers to questions as to
                    how farmers had succeeded in developing production systems through
                    inter-planting of soil-retaining trees and food crops, where they could both
                    provide a livelihood and conserve the land in steep hilly areas.We also
                    conducted a series of studies on conserving biological diversity through USAID
                    support for setting up parks and protected areas in countries like Nepal,
                    Madagascar, Jamaica, Thailand, Costa Rica, and Sri Lanka. Our goal was to
                    identify ways to protect biological resources in situ, as part of protected
                    national parks, while at the same time providing a livelihood for members of
                    communities in and around those areas who previously had made a living by
                    hunting, farming, fishing or logging inside those protected areas. Our objective
                    was to find ways to provide alternative sources of income from national parks by
                    converting hunters into tour guides and loggers into nature lodge employees.</p>
                <p>One of the most salient findings of these studies was that success is directly
                    tied to the degree in which local individuals and communities were involved in
                    the development program. USAID is now doing a lot of this in the environmental
                    area where we are concerned about conserving biological diversity and villages
                    around parks and protected areas. If we don't include those affected when
                    setting up a wildlife refuge or protected area, they are going to continue to
                    cultivate crops, fell trees and poach animals on the land. Where we can engage
                    local communities in planning and managing protected areas and involved them in
                    opportunities to generate income from nature tourism and that sort of thing,
                    then our programs have a much better chance of success.</p>
                <p>The findings of those studies have since made their way into program guidance for
                    USAID and its development partners. Each of these global evaluation studies
                    synthesized conclusions across countries and have come up with recommendations
                    for project and country level activities that are environmentally more sound
                    than practices followed in the past.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular issues or experiences you picked
                        up in trying to do these kinds of studies? We can see the reports and by
                        reading them we can get the content, but in the process was there anything
                        you learned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>CHURCH: The process of doing evaluations is a mixture of both art and science.
                    The scientific method still applies. Sampling must be statistically sound and
                    measurement biases must be avoided in collecting data. There is a lot of science
                    involved in identifying representative projects and selecting representative
                    project participants. If we cannot do that, we cannot extend our findings to the
                    broader population of projects and settings where USAID works.</p>
                <p>But there is also an art involved. The art begins when a USAID country mission is
                    approached and told that one or more of its projects have been selected as part
                    of a global program evaluation. USAID mission staff can be a bit apprehensive
                    when somebody calls them from Washington and asks to come out and do a study in
                    their backyard! USAID/Washington visitors inevitably place demands for time and
                    resources on a USAID field mission. Evaluation finding potentially could either
                    help or hurt the mission's future programs. Working with a field mission becomes
                    a delicate diplomatic process particularly when you tell them you are coming to
                    do an objective assessment of programs that have gone on for some time and may
                    be an integral part of the USAID mission's country strategy.</p>
                <p>On occasion we have wanted to go into a country at a time when the mission was
                    trying to negotiate a new project with the government. We'd call and say we'd
                    like to come and talk to government officials and visit old project sites. When
                    you come from Washington and you are identified with USAID, you are perceived as
                    part of the negotiation process whether you intend it or not. Even traveling on
                    our own resources, working independent of the missions, renting our own
                    transportation and office space, we still are identified with the USAID mission
                    in the country from the standpoint of the government and locals.</p>
                <p>Another challenge is how to conduct meaningful global program assessments with
                    limited budgets, time and staff. Assembling teams quickly, doing the field work
                    in a matter of weeks and putting out a report in time to move on to the next
                    country and study requires a lot of orchestration. Looking at agriculture and
                    natural resources programs was particularly demanding because it involved travel
                    to more remote areas of a developing country. Traveling in the rainy season
                    where roads are closed or blocked and it is hard to get through imposes a
                    physical restraint on your ability to move to a large enough number of sites to
                    get a representative sample of data that will produce a result with a confidence
                    level high enough that people won't question the validity of what you have been
                    doing... these are the realities we faced when doing evaluation work. Add to
                    this, training people to follow the same methodology in different parts of the
                    world and selecting evaluators that can get around in different languages and
                    you can begin to appreciate the challenges that evaluations face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you come out on the issue of attribution?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>CHURCH: In the last analysis attribution is not really the issue. USAID's most
                    vital development strategy is “leverage.” The ability to put a small amount of
                    money into a program to leverage the use of large amounts of local resources in
                    a more effective fashion is what the development process is about. The challenge
                    is know how to use a small amount of development assistance to get people to do
                    things differently and better... whether or not USAID gets credit for making
                    things happen. This is particularly true at a time when USAID budgets and staff
                    are shrinking and the Agency is being asked to do more with less.</p>
                <p>If we can posit a “plausible association” between the provision of USAID
                    assistance and development results we should be content. For example, over
                    USAID's 30 years of economic assistance in Costa Rica, a country which has
                    “graduated” from USAID assistance, there is a strong plausible association
                    between USAID support and the strides that country has made on all development
                    fronts. We can directly attribute to USAID assistance the emerging fresh
                    vegetable or cut flower industries that Costa Rica has today. We can point to
                    loans we have given, agribusiness loans, technical assistance, training and
                    whatnot to those programs to the agricultural sector in the country, but it is
                    hard to separate out USAID's assistance from other donors. Over the long run
                    with the level of activity and the support that USAID gave to the country, we
                    are justified in saying that there is a plausible association between what USAID
                    contributed and the changes that have since taken place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other aspects of your work in the evaluation
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The Agency's evaluation work afforded the opportunity to identify new
                    directions to follow after ending my USAID career. I maintain an active interest
                    in evaluation work. I think it is the overlooked area of development assistance.
                    USAID's senior management appears now to recognize the value of sound evaluation
                    and results. USAID management never constrained the evaluation work we did or
                    asked us to modify the findings.</p>
                <p>Remember, the Agency runs evaluation work from the Policy and Program
                    Coordination (PPC) Bureau, which reports directly to the USAID Administrator and
                    serves to provide unbiased information to Agency senior management. Because of
                    where they are based in the USAID organization, evaluators are about as popular
                    as auditors. In fact we viewed ourselves as “development auditors” in some
                    respects, not always a popular role to play in the Agency. But, I think for
                    those reasons, we have produced quality findings and lessons learned and quality
                    products in which development practitioners can have a high degree of confidence
                    that they provide some useful, constructive, and unbiased contributions to
                    improving the state of the art of development assistance. For me an ideal way to
                    wind up a 25 year career with the Agency was spending those last few years
                    pulling together the USAID's experience base as a legacy for future USAID
                    development officers.</p>
                <p>Retired from USAID to Direct USAID's Economic and Social Data Service (1995 -
                    2000)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wound up in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: I finished my career as a foreign service officer with USAID in the late
                    fall of 1995, Thanksgiving weekend to be exact. It was not an easy decision. I
                    could have stayed on for a few more years, and perhaps gone overseas one more
                    time. I was tempted away from the Agency, however, by the opportunity to head up
                    a USAID contract that managed, analyzed and disseminated development statistics
                    for USAID staff and development assistance partners. The contract afforded the
                    opportunity to continue my interest in development work while transitioning to
                    the private sector. It was a move that I knew I would soon need to make because
                    foreign service careers require you to move up into management levels and away
                    from the technical work as an economist which was my love and certainly my
                    career preference. Conducting technical project work was also where I felt I
                    could give most to the Agency.</p>
                <p>I'm glad I moved on when I did. Congress and the administration soon after became
                    locked in nasty budget battles that were no fun at all for those staying behind.
                    In fact, shortly after I departed, the Agency had to shed itself of a number of
                    staff in a government wide downsizing process that left many more of my foreign
                    service colleagues on the street sooner than they anticipated. So, I was able to
                    walk out of the office Friday afternoon as a government employee and walk in an
                    office nearby Monday morning as a consultant to the Agency for the next five
                    years of my contract.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it relates to your USAID and CDIE experience, can
                        you describe this experience after retiring from USAID and from the foreign
                        service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: While I left the foreign service and USAID, I certainly view what I am
                    now doing as a continuation of my career in international development. Now I
                    work as a USAID contractor, rather than as an Agency employee. I'm currently
                    employed by an economic consulting firm, DevTech Systems Inc. and direct a
                    USAID-funded project that is responsible for managing, analyzing and
                    disseminating the statistics on developing countries that USAID employs in its
                    development assistance programming and monitoring. I oversee the work of a group
                    of ten bright young economists who are very enthusiastic about using state of
                    the art information technology to get the best possible information on
                    developing countries to Agency decision-makers.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>USAID is one of more than two dozen federal agencies around Washington DC which
                    are responsible for managing government statistics. Other federal agencies
                    include the Departments oCommerce, Treasury, Agriculture, anState as well as the
                    CIA, CDC [Center for Disease Control], EPA [Environmental Protection Agency],
                    and USTR, which use statistical data on countries around the world. Because the
                    United States is a contracting member to many international treaties and
                    agreements and organizations such as the UN [United Nations] system, the World
                    Bank, IMF [International Monetary Fund], the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs
                    and Trade], it receives from those organizations large amounts of data on other
                    member countries. USAID is responsible for collecting, warehousing and
                    disseminating data that are compiled by the international development
                    organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations. My ESDS staff manage
                    that data in electronic data bases which we make available to development
                    officers in USAID and to users in other federal agencies as well as private
                    organizations and academic institutions.Managing that data requires verifying,
                    editing, coding and warehousing that data in a uniform fashion so that it is
                    readily retrievable for analysis and reporting. Unfortunately, every
                    international organization has its own member countries, its own way of viewing
                    the world. Our task is to organize the huge volume of statistical information
                    that becomes available each year. In addition, project staff have the skills to
                    extract the data, examine it for, say, trends over time or comparisons of
                    performance across countries at similar development stages and prepare reports
                    for USAID staff needing to know the impact of Agency assistance efforts.</p>

                <p>CHURCH: We respond to phone, fax and E-mail requests from USAID's field missions
                    and from regional and functional bureaus within USAID/Washington. We try to be
                    the eyes and ears of our field missions as well as our offices here in
                    Washington. We also assist private industry, academic institutions, and
                    individuals, graduate students doing thesis research. We produce publications
                    and maintain a web site where development statistics can be readily obtained in
                    more consolidated and organized formats by the public at large, particularly the
                    Agency's development partners.</p>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>CHURCH: One of the most popular data sets we compile annually is on U.S. trade
                    with developing countries. One of the questions Congress regularly asks is,
                    “What has foreign aid done for American business?” “What is America's interest
                    in foreign aid?” So, we have attempted to put together statistical information
                    on commodity trade between the United States and developing countries by region
                    and by groups of countries. We look for trends and emerging patterns in U.S.
                    trade with those countries over the last two decades trying to demonstrate that
                    developing countries are among America's growing overseas clients. For example,
                    countries of the Asia region now take on as much importance as our traditional
                    European, Canadian, and Australian partners.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The public is also quite interested in what we call official development
                    flows (ODF) coming not just from the United States but from other donor nations.
                    The member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
                    Development (OECD) — the United States, the European countries, Canada, Japan,
                    Australia, New Zealanhave all recently declined in their levels of international
                    giving. With reflows to these donors by developing countries paying back their
                    debts, new net development resources are declining in growth. The multilateral
                    donors - the World Bank and the regional development banks - make up some but
                    not all the difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on that you want to comment on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: USAID has taken a leadership role in providing up-to-date and accurate
                    information on what is going on in developing countries. Still, we have a ways
                    to go in getting an accurate reading of how economically or socially healthy a
                    country is. Our tools are still relatively primitive. When you and I go for an
                    annual physical checkup, the doctor takes our pulse, raps on our knee, takes
                    some bodily fluid samples, and sends them off to a laboratory. At the end of the
                    process our doctor can give us a fairly good assessment of our physical health.
                    Well, in the development field, we still haven't got that good a handle on the
                    best way to measure the economic, social, and political health of a country. Our
                    equivalent of a doctor's thermometer is still very crude and poorly calibrated.
                    And we're not really sure where to stick it to give us an accurate reading!</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>For example, using per capita income as an measure of development is not very
                    accurate because it fails to account for distribution of that income and for the
                    costs of the social services that income can buy. New and better welfare
                    measures are evolving which are based on scores for such factors as access to
                    housing, potable water, education, and health services. Similarly, some
                    organizations are developing measures of democratic freedom based on scores for
                    civil liberties, freedom of the press, rights to associate, numbers of political
                    parties, levels of corruption and government control. But these efforts to
                    measure the development process more accurately are still evolving.</p>
                <p>Still, it is an exciting and interesting period in which to conduct development
                    work to rid the world of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and political
                    oppression. Some day, I hope the next generation of USAID development officers
                    will have reached these goals and can say, “Job well done!”</p>
                <p>Observations on 25 years of experience in international development programs</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have worked for over a quarter of a century
                        development issues at both local and global levels. How would you compare
                        the world's condition at the outset of your career with today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHURCH: The world is a better place if only because more people now have the
                    knowledge and knowhow to live a better life. But there are also a lot more
                    people to accommodate on this planet and that brings a special challenge to use
                    this knowledge and knowhow judiciously and equitably and avoid the waste and
                    mistakes that mankind has made along the way. There has been forward progress on
                    a global scale but this is no time to be complacent about those gains. Gains can
                    evaporate quickly.</p>
                <p>It has fallen to the United States to play a leadership role in international
                    development. In war and in peace the United States has shown it is prepared to
                    make the sacrifice. My concern is that we can get too complacent, neglect the
                    “silent” wars that need fighting against poverty, hunger, illiteracy, disease,
                    political oppression and environmental degradation. We aren't just giving
                    resources to the rest of the world; we are making investments in our own
                    future.</p>
                <p>We have a common global responsibility to maintain this planet as an acceptable
                    place where all can live. Reduction of poverty in the developing world is just
                    one of those aspects of fix up and patch up a world that is still in a state of
                    disrepair. I look at our U.S. involvement in ongoing international development
                    work as critical to a sustainable global future. We are the leaders as well as
                    the doers.</p>
