                <p>AMBASSADOR RICHARD FUNKHOUSER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 2, 1988</p>
                <p>Copyright 1999 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, how did you become attracted to the
                        ForeigService?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: I suppose it started when my grandfather had a set of “National
                    Geographics.” I was born and raised as a young man in Trenton, New Jersey, and,
                    whimsically, I used to look at the “National Geographics” and figure out the
                    farthest place I could get from Trenton, which turned out to be Outer Mongolia,
                    in the country of the yaks, and I resolved that I would get there. I pursued
                    that goal reasonably consistently through my prep school and university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of preparation did you have in school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, I had the usual liberal arts in Taft School. And perhaps there
                    I got my best foundation. As the Duke, our English teacher in Honors English,
                    told us: we would probably never know more about English literature and history
                    in our intellectual careers than we did when we were seniors at Taft School. I
                    found that I basically got my best foundation there.</p>
                <p>At Princeton, I started off in History and English, but my father went broke
                    during the depression, and I had to aim at getting a job. So, I went from the
                    liberal arts into engineering. But I found that I disliked engineering and went
                    back into liberal arts. The only way I could get back there was through geology,
                    in the Arts [and] not [the] Science curriculum. So I thought I might get a job
                    with an oil company when I got out of school. Indeed, that turned out to be the
                    case so that my background is not as much history and political science as it
                    might have been. I got high marks, became a Phi Beta and got on what Princeton
                    called the “No-course Plan,” which was for those students who had top grades.
                    And I worked very, very hard. I'm not all that intelligent, but I worked like a
                    dog to keep my scholarship. Then I was allowed to take any courses I wanted in
                    my senior year. So I could sit in on history, art, science, architecture, any
                    courses I wished, which proved to be reasonably useful in later years in my
                    Foreign Service career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you move to the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: After I got out of Princeton in '39 and was offered a job by Nelson
                    Rockefeller, who had attended a Yale-Harvard-Princeton Conference where I spoke.
                    He passed the word on that Standard Oil might give me a job.</p>
                <p>I went to South America for Standard Oil of Venezuela. In those days I had read
                    all of the literature on how to get into the Foreign Service. They didn't teach
                    languages at that time to the extent they do now, and they urged young men who
                    were interested in foreign affairs to try it out first. And to try it out, not
                    at government expense, but at private industry expense. Commercial activities
                    were very important, as you know, in the Foreign Service in those days. We were
                    encouraged to go with private industry abroad to learn the languages, to find
                    out whether we were truly interested in life overseas, and if a foreign
                    environment would find us useful. I always had in mind taking my FSO exams.</p>
                <p>But then the war broke out. I went into the Air Force following Pearl Harbor,
                    several of us young geologists/engineers working for Standard Oil Company in
                    Venezuela resigned to volunteer for the Army Air Corps, despite our exemption
                    from military service for the duration. Aside from youthful patriotism and
                    vision of becoming a pilot, it was for me a chance to change careers from
                    industry hopefully to diplomacy. I went to Burma, India, China. Came back. Went
                    to the State Department, asked when the exams were being given. Standard Oil had
                    promised me a job and a house (I was married during the war) in Venezuela at a
                    good salary. But I always wanted to get in the Foreign Service. When I arrived
                    at Old State they told me at the desk that the examinations had just been given
                    the day before. I asked, “When will the next ones be given?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, next year.”</p>
                <p>Needless to say, I had to earn a living and was about ready to go back to
                    Venezuela with my young bride when the receptionist said, “Well, there are other
                    ways of working overseas. Go down and see our Personnel Officer down in the
                    basement” of what is now the Executive Office Building.</p>
                <p>I went down there and, believe it or not, a classmate of mine, Findley Burns,
                    whom you undoubtedly know, was the young Personnel Officer. He said, “You're an
                    oil expert, aren't you?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You worked for an oil company, didn't you?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>He said, “You're an oil expert to the State Department.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>He said, “We and the British are both trying to get the oil industry back on its
                    feet. Not only the industry, but get oil moving to all the destroyed countries
                    of Western Europe.”Q: We're talking about what, 1945?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: We're talking about 1945 in September. And Findley told me that both
                    the Americans and the British Foreign Service were trying to get a few people to
                    go to key oil industry centers such as Paris with responsibilities for Western
                    Europe and French North Africa, London and the empire as it was, Cairo and all
                    of the Middle East, and Tokyo for the Pacific area. What we were assigned to do
                    was to be contact with government officials who worked on oil problems and
                    energy (they didn't have departments of energy then), Foreign Office people who
                    were trying to handle political problems in oil-producing countries, and/or
                    Treasury reps. We were having great problems with what was called then and
                    became the “dollar-sterling oil problem,” wherein the British would produce oil
                    from the Middle East and sell it for sterling to countries that had built up
                    great pound debts during World War II. The British would sell them “sterling
                    oil” which they could get at a much cheaper price than with American dollars. No
                    one had dollars, everyone had sterling. And so these were problems which had to
                    be worked out in Western Europe.</p>
                <p>Let's take, for example, tank cars. The Germans stole the French tank cars, then
                    the Russians stole the German tank cars. And what a Petroleum Attache had to do
                    was try to get the tank cars back from wherever they were. Many were destroyed,
                    but tank cars are pretty tough, too.</p>
                <p>And pipelines; we had a lot of pipelines in Europe such as were laid down during
                    the war from Marseille up the Rhone Valley. The problem was to dispose of those
                    pipelines. They weren't meant to last very long: they were above the ground and
                    the one from Marseille had so many holes in it from French peasants trying to
                    get gasoline for their tractors that they weren't worth a great deal. But there
                    were problems of negotiation which even as a junior Foreign Service officer
                    Class Six I handled. I became the focal point in the embassy for trying to get
                    the flow of oil moving. This was my first job. I had the title of Acting
                    Regional Petroleum Attache until I took the exams and became a Third Secretary.
                    A secondary but significant responsibility for me was to allocate and distribute
                    to the Americans in France coupons issued by the French government for rationed
                    gasoline. I sometimes wondered why we as a naive, young couple seemed to be so
                    popular and so often invited by businessmen to the best black market
                    restaurants?!</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>In retrospect, I am also struck by how lucky I was to learn my first diplomatic
                    ropes from such outstanding officers as Douglas MacArthur and Livingston
                    Merchant. Coming from three years in the oil fields and two years piloting a
                    plane over the Hump, I was unable to draft reports or speak in meetings
                    effectively. Doug redrafted my diplomatic notes; Livy was a model chairman of
                    staff meetings where he could brilliantly summarize disparate views so as to
                    make each participant believe his contribution was included. No one in my career
                    could match him. This was undoubtedly why our Ambassador, Jefferson Caffery, who
                    strangely enough was embarrassingly inarticulate in large meetings, sent Livy to
                    Washington to sell the $500 million aid package for France which preceded and
                    probably inspired the Marshall Plan.</p>
                <p>Q: I would like to dwell on this, but we're going to concentrate sort of on your
                    more senior time. But knowing the Foreign Service pattern, I noticed that more
                    than anyone that I can recall, you've moved around, both in various areas and
                    different jobs. I mean, obviously your language to begin with was Spanish, I
                    assume?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: It started off with Spanish, but it was vulgar. I learned it in the
                    oil fields and lived with Venezuelan oil roughnecks. It got a few laughs out of
                    Joe Green when I claimed Spanish for the oral exam.</p>
                <p>And then I'd had the usual Latin five years and French five years at Taft and
                    Princeton, so I claimed both Spanish and French and did really very poorly in
                    both in the eyes of the exam board, which I got through narrowly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I notice you became acting DCM in Damascus rather
                        soon in your career. How did this come about? This was 1955 to 1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: The foundation for that, basically, was that my second job was
                    Petroleum Attach� for the entire Middle East from Tehran to the Sudan, from Aden
                    to Istanbul. And I had been to all of the countries of the Middle East,
                    including Syria, over a two-year period reporting on some of the most
                    extraordinary and revolutionary movements in the energy world. I was very lucky
                    to have that job, because in those days, in '47 to '49, we Americans were just
                    trying to get a foothold in the Middle East. We had some concessions in Saudi
                    Arabia, but there were tremendous purchases taking place by Standard Jersey and
                    Socony, and Standard of California and Texas, plus “independents.” And I really
                    got a rich background in a global development and an overview of the Middle East
                    from what is not an unimportant base, that is, the oil point of view, which is
                    political, strategic and economic.</p>
                <p>So, I had both political and economic background in the Middle East, and when the
                    job in Damascus came up I went there, first, as Economic Counselor, then I was
                    put in charge of the Political Section as well, and ended up as DCM.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Q: Let me ask this. Coming in as a petroleum expert into what was still partly
                    the old Foreign Service, which had a certain disdain, or at least had a
                    reputation for disdain for experts, did you find any problems with the Foreign
                    Service in accepting you or being able to operate within that environment?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Yes, yes I did. And consequently I made it a key aim in my career to
                    get out of oil expertise. I came back as George McGhee's so-called petroleum
                    advisor for the Middle East in '49. And that was like advising the Encyclopedia
                    Britannica on oil. He made his first hundred million as a Rhodes scholar who
                    found a huge gas field in Louisiana. But in any event, my aim was to get out of
                    specialization for just that reason. It was certainly very useful to me because
                    it gave me infinitely more responsibilities than other junior officers and
                    enabled me to get promoted faster, which was in every ambitious Foreign Service
                    officer's interest. But after six highly exciting and productive years as an oil
                    expert, I asked if I could get into the political section. I became, in '52 I
                    think, the desk officer for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. That really moved me into
                    the accepted service.</p>
                <p>Also, I had taken my Foreign Service exams. I got into State as an expert, but I
                    had been advised strongly at the onset by Newby Walmsley and other career
                    Foreign Service officers that to be an FS0-6 [Foreign Service Officer Class Six]
                    is infinitely more important to your career than to be an FSR-2 [Foreign Service
                    Reserve Officer Class Two].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a Foreign Service reserve
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: That's right. So I took my exams, and I got through them and came in.
                    I went backwards, dropped my reserve commission, and went back into FS0-6, which
                    was the bottom, Third Secretary, at a loss of salary, but I got into the
                    mainstream. Yes, you're right. There was a spirit against the expert in those
                    days, and rightfully so. I wanted to move into the political area, as well as
                    the broader economic area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, turning to that, I would like to move to your
                        assignment tMoscow as Economic Counselor in 1961 to 1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: I arrived in Moscow September 1, 1961, at four o'clock in the
                    afternoon and departed September 1, 1964 at four PM. Three years to the dot.
                    (Tours of duty at Moscow, a maximum “hardship post,” rarely exceeded two years.
                    When asked to serve a third year, I had to promise my wife “not one minute
                    more.”</p>
                <p>Q: How did this come about?</p>

                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, it was sort of a natural progression. I had been in economic
                    and commercial affairs a good part of my career in the Middle East, in Western
                    Europe, in Syria. I also had political experience in Middle Eastern affairs. I
                    had been bombed in Cairo by American Lend-Lease B-17s with American pilots
                    making $1,000 a flight over Cairo flying for the Zionists. I saw the Palestine
                    situation from the beginning. Fifty years later, it is hard to remember how
                    popular the U.S. was throughout the Middle East. Unlike the colonial powers,
                    Americans had established the only Western-type universities in the region with
                    the result that the ruling classes were predominantly pro-American. This changed
                    overnight in 1948 with the partition of Palestine and American sponsorship of
                    the state of Israel over the vehement objections of Secretary of State General
                    Marshall and all other top officials except Truman's Domestic Affairs Advisor,
                    Clark Clifford. I have often wondered whether Truman's decision pushed his
                    candidacy over Dewey over the top several months later? I had been assigned to
                    Palestine and to a dozen Arab countries. And when I was in Syria during the Suez
                    Crisis it became very clear to me, not so much through cynicism I think, but
                    through realism, if you know the Middle East, you know that the United States is
                    quite unable to take and treat Arabs and Israelis evenhandedly.</p>
                <p>I got tired seeing my Arab friends come across a crowded room shaking their
                    finger, “Why do you take these positions,” knowing what they were going to say.
                    I was sympathetic to their point of view to an extent, but nevertheless was
                    reluctant to get in the middle of an ancient fight between two “brothers.” I
                    learned on the Iraq, Syria and Lebanon Desk that lesson when I invited the top
                    Arab whom I knew in Washington to meet with the Special Advisor to the
                    Secretary, the top representative of the Jewish point of view in Washington.
                    I'll never forget it. I drove up in a little Topollino, which was a cheap
                    Italian car which you could pick up and the sort of convertible that you put the
                    top back with one hand. Up drove Kayali, the military attache from the Syrian
                    embassy...he was very bright and had very good connections...in a big blue, I
                    think it was, big blue convertible Cadillac. He was followed by the
                    representative in the State Department on Jewish affairs in a big white Cadillac
                    convertible. It was hard to tell them apart. They looked very, very similar and
                    swarthy. They both had a certain weight. Both were very, very bright. And we
                    went up to Kayali's apartment. And within five minutes of the conversation, and
                    here I was trying to get the point of view from both sides, it became very
                    evident to me they liked each other, they knew everything about the other's
                    business. They were fun to be around. They enjoyed each other's company. I
                    thought to myself, “Why in heaven's name are you, Dick Funkhouser, and/or the
                    United States, trying to get between these two?” And I resolved that that was an
                    unresolvable question for the United States Government. I guess it was cowardly,
                    but I wanted no further part of Middle Eastern Affairs, because I thought it was
                    and would be a disaster. I later prepared a “Doomsday Scenario” along the lines
                    of Nevil Shute's “On the Beach” in which nuclear disaster starts in the Middle
                    East. I visualized unlimited U.S. political/financial/military/media support for
                    Israel driving the Arabs first to despair, next to terrorism, then to oil
                    blockade, then to war (non-nuclear).</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Current Middle East and other press reports asserting that Secretary of State
                    Albright has stacked her Middle East staff with Jewish officers, that she
                    believes power exists to be used, that she plans to extend NATO eastwards to
                    Israel might rekindle this scenario, however off my timetable. Equally off in
                    timing was my last message to the Department January 30, 1976 on retirement in
                    which my “swan song” depicted the Middle East as the foremost, long-term threat
                    to U.S. security because of our blank-check for Israel under all Congresses and
                    Presidents (except Eisenhower). I concluded irreverently, “Holy Christ...what
                    would He think as a Jew, prophet or Son of God to return home?” I was reminded
                    of how we scoffed at the outlandish statement of our UN Ambassador, Warren
                    Austin, during the UN debates on Palestine in 1948, “Why can't the Arabs and
                    Jews act like good Christians?!” Fifty years later, this possibility of the
                    Golden Rule replacing “an eye for an eye” (or rather “10 eyes for an eye”) seems
                    even more remote.</p>
                <p>And so, I tried to get out. When I got assigned to the National War College, I
                    did my thesis on what I knew, which was the Middle East, and what I hoped to
                    know, which was its border problems with the Soviet Union. I studied Russian in
                    the early morning FSI [Foreign Service Institute] classes and I did my thesis on
                    the historical establishment of the land boundaries between Russia and Turkey,
                    Afghanistan, Persia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you saw your career going in one direction, you made a
                        verconscious effort to turn it around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: I did indeed. To move into an area that I wanted to be in. It's not
                    unique. Many officers want to leave the Third World, whether Africa or South
                    America or the Middle East, and try to get into countries that really are closer
                    to Western civilization, where most families basically prefer to be.</p>
                <p>Q: When you went to Moscow as Economic Counselor, again we're talking about 1961
                    to 1964, what were your main tasks? This was the beginning of the Kennedy
                    Administration, obviously a time of testing and strain and all. But as Economic
                    Counselor, what were your jobs?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, the Economic Counselor in Moscow has on his staff various
                    experts: on nuclear energy, on agriculture. One of my major jobs there was to
                    work on budgetary problems, particularly those that might indicate where the
                    Soviets were spending their money, given all of the vast difficulties of
                    figuring out anything significant from what the Soviets published, such as the
                    progress on the Five Year Plan. Certainly nothing was more important to the
                    Embassy or Washington than to try to analyze how the Soviets were doing when
                    they put out their progress report on how they were fulfilling their Five Year
                    Plan. Whether they were putting more money into, as Khrushchev did, into
                    agriculture....he plowed up the virgin lands, for example. We, through our very
                    expert agricultural attaches, would go wherever we were allowed to go, look at
                    the crops and see whether the harvest would be such as to support what the
                    Soviets were claiming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was quite a gamble, wasn't it, on Khrushchev's
                        part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Oh, it was a gamble, and it helped seal his doom. It was a disaster.
                    He plowed up the virgin lands. You know he went to Iowa, saw our corn there and
                    thought that maybe because it was flat, the virgin lands of Kazakhstan might
                    have had the same fertility and the same soil that we do in the West. But it
                    wasn't that way. The topsoil was far thinner. And the virgin fields blew into
                    the Caspian when he plowed it up, like plowing up the wild grass on a sand dune.
                    But we followed that closely, and this was important from an economic standpoint
                    to the United States because we like to sell them vast quantities of wheat. And
                    so a very key part of what we did was in that field, and I would say we totally
                    missed drawing the right conclusion.</p>
                <p>One of the things I learned as Economic Counselor there was the extent to which
                    the Soviet society and government can surprise the West. Even with satellite
                    pictures you can't tell what amount of grain the Soviets have in their storage
                    bins. We went into a negotiation with the Soviets, and so did the Canadians, on
                    wheat in 1964. (cf. New York Times, front page 3/3/64.) We knew the harvest was
                    bad. That was evident from reading between the lines in Pravda and grain
                    journals, agricultural journals, and from what they would allow us to see.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>But we were totally startled to find out when the negotiations started that the
                    Soviets wanted a billion dollars worth of grain. This was the world's largest
                    grain deal ever proposed, and we were totally taken by surprise. Why? Was the
                    Foreign Service not doing its job? No. The problem was that we didn't know that
                    Russia had no reserves. That was obviously a very strategic and military secret,
                    which we did not know. We should have known more back in Washington. If the
                    Agency, if State, or if Commerce had been smarter in those days, they would have
                    noted that the Soviets were chartering up tankers two weeks before the
                    negotiations started. They chartered all of the grain tankers that they could,
                    and this should have been noted and given us a hint. It would have had great
                    importance to figure out how much money the Soviets were going to put on the
                    table. And so this was a very personal lesson in the ability of another society
                    to totally surprise us.</p>
                <p>During my tour in Moscow, the Soviet ability to surprise the world was
                    demonstrated three times: 1) this billion-dollar wheat deal, 2) missiles in Cuba
                    and 3) the overnight ouster of Khrushchev, which no diplomat or correspondent
                    there claimed to have expected. In trouble, yes, but to wake up and find him
                    gone peacefully, never. However, perhaps even more surprising in my diplomatic
                    experience was not the acts of secret enemy societies but of our allies, i.e.,
                    Suez, where our closest allies, the British, French and Israelis, attacked Egypt
                    without our foreknowledge. I have never understood how our intelligence services
                    could have failed to uncover this plot or, if they did, to inform the President!
                    As is known, he was infuriated, particularly since the Soviets picked the
                    occasion to invade Hungary, and he forced our allies (and Zionists at home and
                    abroad) to backtrack, quite a feat.</p>
                <p>Q: Well now, this is speaking within our own society and the bureaucracy, what
                    you were doing, the analyzing of the Five Year Plan is exactly the sort of thing
                    that the CIA is supposed to do, too.</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Oh, yes. We worked very closely together.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this a cooperative effort, or were they doing on their side, while you
                    were doing it on yours? Or did you have a feeling of real cooperation there?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: I had great respect their economic cadre, I guess the CIA calls it,
                    and the economic and financial experts in the CIA. I had to be briefed before I
                    went to the Soviet Union. We would get from the Agency a list of non-classified
                    questions which they considered any intelligent American business man or
                    diplomat should try to get answers to. And they're basically pretty simple. What
                    is the grain harvest? What are the papers saying? What are their reserves? which
                    we never could answer. And I found that they relied heavily on us. We had covert
                    CIA people from their Directorate of Operations in the Embassy, but I had no
                    working relationship with them. I worked very closely with the agents
                    (Directorate of Intelligence) on economic subjects, because none of it basically
                    was covert. It was all open. We were all trying to get to the same point.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The extent of cooperation back in the Department, I think, wacooperative, but
                    bureaucratically jealous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A certain amount of competitiveness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Basically, State had one person in Soviet Affairs that I reported to
                    on economic policy. In fact, he was an older gentleman, not as old as I am now,
                    but he was very relaxed, and he did very, very little. Almost all the economic
                    reporting and the economic intelligence on the Soviet Union in 1961 to 1964 was,
                    I would say, 95% done by the Agency overtly. I guess almost all overtly, because
                    you just can't be very covert in the economic area.</p>
                <p>In-house secrecy can, of course, be essential when it comes to covert CIA
                    operations in an Embassy. “Need to know” rules. Two such operations stand out in
                    my personal experience. One, the Penkovsky affair in Moscow (described later)
                    and two, the U.S.-UK plot to overthrow the pro-Soviet President of Syria in
                    1956. In neither case was I “in the loop” although serving as Counselor of
                    Embassy at the time. The Damascus plot was exposed to me inadvertently by
                    ineptitude of the plotters, e.g., the CIA station chief was stone-deaf and could
                    be heard inside or outside the Embassy without bugging devices. To me, the most
                    bizarre twist in this foiled plot was that the date chosen for our plot was the
                    identical day our allies picked to invade the Suez Canal! I've always wondered
                    if they could have pulled a historic “scam” by diverting us from Suez and
                    implicating us at the same time in their Middle East plot to overthrow Nasser
                    and his allies.</p>
                <p>So I was their man in Moscow, I would say, and they were my backers in
                    Washington, because the State Department basically deferred to the Agency on
                    agricultural and economic policy. Not policy so much, but getting the facts. So
                    I'd say we worked extremely closely. That doesn't mean we didn't have
                    knock-down, drag-out fights. In my amateurism, I had chosen to attempt an
                    analysis of the direction of the Soviet military budget and policy by dissecting
                    the speeches, the written word, the top statements made by Khrushchev and others
                    at key occasions, and note when adjectives changed in such statements as “We are
                    giving the 'top' priority to development of higher standard of living for Soviet
                    citizens, including more money into consumer goods and into agriculture and
                    food.” And then you'd see, “We are giving 'high' priority to the development of
                    consumer goods and agricultural reserves.”</p>
                <p>I can't really repeat the language now, but I did a very provocative report on
                    the military trend, which indicated in 1962 that, judged on an economic basis
                    only, all of the adjectives and all of the nuances which I in the Economic
                    Section could find were tilting towards heavy industry and towards strengthening
                    the military, compared to whatever existed. The nuances were all moving towards
                    the military.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Tommy Thompson, the Ambassador, fully supported my report. But Boris Klosson,
                    Political Counselor, was upset with an Economic Counselor getting into political
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the DCM at this time? FUNKHOUSER: No, he was my
                        opposite number.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Political Counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: He was Political Counselor, I was Economic Counselor, and Jack
                    McSweeney was DCM. And Tommy Thompson, Ambassador Thompson to me then. We did
                    play poker up to his death, together...thought it was an excellent report and
                    decided we would challenge Washington on the diversion. All the evidence we
                    cited, some of it seemingly trivial, showed the Soviets were tilting
                    increasingly towards the military. The CIA ripped me apart, because they were
                    the experts on budget. And they came back with the most microeconomic analysis
                    that no general Foreign Service officer could possibly match, proving I was
                    wrong. Six months later Cuba took place, and I got some credit for being one of
                    the few that at least got on the record a Soviet military buildup six months
                    before the massive military operation that took place in Cuba.</p>
                <p>Another of my major responsibilities, not unrelated to a shift of resources to
                    the military, was the “Big Inch Pipeline” crash project designed to tie both
                    East and West Europe into dependency on Soviet oil while earning scarce hard
                    currency. Over strong objections in certain Western circles, notably France, the
                    West German Economic Counselor and I were successful in persuading the necessary
                    authorities to cancel the West German Mannesmann steel plant contract to roll 36
                    inch pipe for the Soviets. Khrushchev was of course apoplectic; he claimed that
                    the Soviets could roll their own 36 inch pipe, a rarity at the time for steel
                    mills. He had boasted that he was going to “bury” us. In the end, the line was
                    delayed an indeterminate time and completed only to the East German border. What
                    this disruption of the Soviet economy and its long-term plans contributed to the
                    eventual Soviet collapse is for those with access to Soviet archives to
                    determine.</p>
                <p>Q: The Cuban missile crisis. That was October of 1962. How did this play for you
                    in the Embassy in Moscow?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, it was, as you know, startling. When the crisis broke one of
                    the things that impressed me, as in the Middle East, mobs formed, so called.
                    Crowds formed. But unlike the Middle East nobody got stoned, as an American
                    would during the Suez crisis.</p>
                <p>The so-called mobs and demonstrators in Moscow would stop when thred traffic
                    light came on! They'd stop!</p>

                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Oh, did you? You know exactly what I'm talking about. But to see any
                    demonstration in the Soviet Union was really new to everyone. We were all told
                    not to provoke the crowd. Just board up the windows at the Tchaikovsky Boulevard
                    Embassy. Some of us lived there. Not to appear in the windows, which would be
                    mob-inciting, as it certainly would in any underdeveloped country. Of course, we
                    peeked out, and I remember, and this is illustrative of the question you asked.
                    Here's this great demonstration. A few ink bottles thrown at the Embassy. The
                    police were down with the demonstrators, but not doing anything. And one of the
                    New York Times correspondents, Ted Shabad, we noted leaving, which we were
                    forbidden to do, but you can't control the press. Leaving the embassy compound,
                    going out into the mob, the demonstrators.</p>
                <p>Well, we wondered what would happen. And a circle formed around him, and the
                    police were near him. When he came back, we asked. Nothing apparently happened,
                    except that's what happened. They all wanted to know what the news was. They
                    were scared to death that there might be trouble—really worried. And there's no
                    doubt that the worse the crisis got, the Soviets in every conceivable way, the
                    Soviet people—we had an artistic group there, and they weren't all that good—but
                    they got so many ovations during this period that they had to move the Soviets
                    out of the theater. We took it as an expression of “We don't want any fight, bad
                    relations, particularly a war with the United States.” It was quite clear that
                    the people were demonstrating that they didn't want any part of confrontation
                    with the U.S. That must have influenced Khrushchev, as well as the bombers we
                    sent towards Soviet Union.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Russian bureaucracy during this period shut down
                        on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: No, no. In no way. No way. I dealt with Gherman Gvishiani, who was
                    the Deputy Minister for Scientific and Technical Research, the organization that
                    basically is charged with stealing our commercial secrets. Oleg Penkovsky, our
                    famous spy who tipped us off on missiles in Cuba, was one of my principal overt
                    contacts in his capacity as Protocol Officer of Gherman Gvishiani's Committee
                    for Scientific and Technical Research. But until shortly before he was caught,
                    tortured and shot, I was kept in the dark about his spy role. I found him rather
                    pompous and gave little deference to him, undoubtedly to his surprise and
                    annoyance. Only when the DCM Jack McSweeney wrote out on a piece of paper (to
                    maintain mandatory audio-security in the Embassy) asking whether I had invited
                    Penkovsky with other Committee officials to my periodic “movie night” in my
                    Embassy apartment did I suspect his vital role. “Need to know” had been
                    successfully followed. I learned later that it was in my bathroom that he was
                    tipped off that the KGB was closing in on him and that he had sent his last
                    fortunately erroneous warning to the USG that the Soviets were to launch their
                    nukes! Ironically, I was the temporarily ranking officer in the Embassy when
                    called to the Foreign Office to receive the official Soviet protest of U.S.
                    spying. (See New York Times12/26/62 front page.) But he was a very powerful man,
                    son-in-law of Central Committee member Kosygin, and I had no trouble doing my
                    work. It was quite the opposite.</p>
                <p>The officials were like the French during times when DeGaulle was being very
                    difficult with the Americans, and I became Political Counselor in Paris. They
                    showed great concern that they might be talking to an American during the
                    critical periods, but never was the door closed to me in Paris or Moscow during
                    those times. It was obvious that they wanted no part of the government
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you served under two of our major Russian

                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Three really. Chip Bohlen in Paris.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, the three of them were totally different, I would say. Tommy
                    Thompson was very reserved. He wasn't a hail-fellow-well-met, and he was very
                    precise. He was the most, I would say, attentive to details. After all, he
                    negotiated the only withdrawal known at that time, or maybe since, withdrawal of
                    Soviet troops from a foreign country.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: No, in Vienna. He did the Vienna negotiation. He had seen it all. He
                    had dealt with the Soviets, and no one of the three, I think, had his experience
                    in negotiating with the Soviet Union, so nothing really interested him more than
                    building up an accurate file on information that could have policy
                    considerations for the United States more than the other two, I would dare say,
                    although I'd hate to have to have Foy Kohler hear me say that. All of them were
                    top flight diplomatists. But you asked about style. Tommy Thompson was 'do the
                    work, forget the fun and games,' although he had two children and was a very
                    fine parent. Sent one of them to a Russian public school together with my son.
                    But a very serious, cold externally, warm at heart, but a man who ran a very
                    precise staff meeting. He would understate what he wanted, and a few people who
                    thought that they had a special relationship with Thompson, such as Boris
                    Klosson, would go see movies in Thompson's flat and really was a favorite of the
                    Ambassador socially, could overestimate the value of friendship over
                    professional performance. I recall one staff meeting where I had heard the
                    Ambassador ask Boris softly, “I would like a report at earliest possible date on
                    this subject.” And Boris had either forgotten it or didn't do it, and he'll
                    never forget it, because the Ambassador aimed a reprimand at him which froze the
                    entire staff meeting. I learned a lesson: “If the Ambassador ever asks for
                    anything, and he didn't often, but by God drop everything, get at it and get
                    back to him as fast as you possibly can.” That's the way he operated. He only
                    said it once, but you'd better pay attention. Style again.</p>
                <p>Foy Kohler, quite the opposite. Delightful, showed up at all the American
                    parties, which Thompson would rarely do. Was an easier man to get along
                    with.</p>
                <p>After all, we were under pressure in the Soviet Union; the families, the wives.
                    We all lived together and worked together, as you know from Yugoslavia, only it
                    was much, much worse. We couldn't open our windows in the offices; we couldn't
                    even type on a typewriter; we had to write everything out in longhand. Security
                    was heavy on us. Moscow was a crucible, which was very hard on the wives
                    particularly. Some took to drink. There would be a morning drinking clutch.
                    Martinis at 11 o'clock. Some became alcoholics. Mental distress from living that
                    closely together, Americans don't do it like Russians, and a man like Foy
                    Kohler, who had no children of his own, nevertheless he and his wife both spent
                    an awful lot of time trying to build a family atmospherein the Embassy, with
                    great success. He obviously was extremely good at everything he did.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The Soviets, I think, had the greatest respect for Thompson of the three. I
                    didn't know about Chip Bohlen in Moscow. But Bohlen spoke by far best the
                    Russian and could really do business in Russian, which neither Thompson nor
                    Kohler, although they were “three/three” in Russian, could. One revealing
                    difference between Bohlen and Thompson was exposed in poker in which they both
                    reveled. Tommy, the Scot, made far more money by judicious conservatism; Chip
                    handled his chips more freely...always wanted to see the last card, a known
                    fatality in the game. Both played for stakes in which a thousand dollars could
                    be won or lost...I always thought it was a security risk in Moscow to open the
                    game to anyone in the Embassy, including low-paid code clerks!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Three/three” refers to the speaking/reading level.
                        Fivspeaking, five reading is the top or bilingual level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: So they were so-called “fluent.” No one in the Moscow Embassy was
                    allowed to go unless he spent one year in a room with a native speaker getting
                    to the three/three level. There are exceptions. For guys who couldn't make it
                    the U.S. government still paid for them to have private tutoring for one year;
                    even a “two/two,” which my deputy was, will be sent to Moscow after his year of
                    language training. But Bohlen was by far the best Russian speaker. He started
                    off his career in Russian school in Paris.</p>
                <p>Q: We might move to your time as Political Counselor in Paris. Then we can talk
                    about Ambassador Bohlen at that point. How did you move from a East European
                    post, a very high position there, to an equally high one in Western Europe? And
                    moving from economic to political. These things in a rather rigid senior officer
                    system seem to be atypical.</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, again, I was lucky. I wanted the job, and those that supported
                    me used the argument that in a capital such as Paris with a man such as
                    DeGaulle, it is not unimportant to have a Political Counselor that has had some
                    experience in the Soviet Union. It is not disadvantageous to have man in the key
                    political position who has at least had some economic training, although we had
                    a very fine economic staff there.</p>
                <p>I guess what did it was I got good marks for my work in Moscow, and the Soviet
                    Union is a very important factor in DeGaulle's philosophy and world politics: it
                    didn't hurt to have a so-called Soviet expert who was there three years. I was
                    asked to stay in Moscow an extra year, and I had the backing of both Thompson
                    and Kohler with Bohlen. When my name was put up among others—I don't know how I
                    got the nod, but I got the nod.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bohlen then would have known you by reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Yes, I knew him; although I didn't know him well. But I think the
                    grapevine certainly didn't hurt me. I had French. I had been in Paris, my first
                    post was France. I had been assigned to Western European countries, which didn't
                    hurt. Political Counselor in Paris basically covers the globe. We had a hot shot
                    expert on Africa in the section, an expert on Eastern Europe, experts on Western
                    Europe internally and externally. A broad background was not disadvantageous; my
                    predecessor had been in Africa: his predecessor had been in the Middle East. The
                    three people before me, none of them really had as much European experience as
                    I'd had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Paris in 1965. You stayed until 1968. Maybe I
                        mighask, how did Ambassador Bohlen run an embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Oh, totally different. Bohlen, he is not with us; I was honored by
                    being the only usher at his funeral. H would turn over in his grave if he heard
                    me say that he ran it by delegation. I use the word as with President Reagan.
                    Bohlen did the big job. He knew DeGaulle. He got along extremely well with
                    DeGaulle. He spoke almost impeccable French, colloquial French. He was the
                    ranking, really, Ambassador in Paris. Everyone deferred to him. He would do his
                    telegrams, and let the Embassy officers do theirs. He would have a staff
                    meeting, go around the room and discuss with some passion anything from economic
                    affairs to military affairs. Dick Walters was his military attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Vernon Walters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Yes. And they didn't get along particularly well, because Vernon
                    Walters probably spoke, well he did speak, even better French than Ambassador
                    Bohlen, and he too had a special relationship with Charles DeGaulle. Among other
                    things he was a consummate professional interpreter, never had a soldier under
                    him, but he got to be a three-star general, I guess, by his genius in
                    linguistics. He was the interpreter for Dwight Eisenhower when DeGaulle invited
                    General Eisenhower to speak to the French crowds at what we call the City Hall
                    from a balcony, and Walters translated for him. Eisenhower spoke for seven
                    minutes, as Walters tells the story, without a pause, and Dick Walters repeated
                    it without a pause for seven minutes. He's unbelievable. And at the end of which
                    DeGaulle turned to Walters and like a school master to a little French student,
                    said simply, “Tr�s bien, Walters [French: Very good, Walters].” But here were
                    these two giants, both extremely, I'd say brilliant is the word. And they
                    clashed. Staff meetings once a week were pretty tense to the point where Walters
                    would only say a few words, because he knew that Ambassador Bohlen would pick
                    him up.</p>
                <p>But it was a very strong Embassy, and to get back to your point, the way he ran
                    the embassy was to delegate. He rarely changed my telegrams, “mine” meaning
                    those of the political section.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I had some extraordinary men working there. Three of them became Ambassadors and

                    had them work for me and to have made sure that the record showed that Jack
                    Perry, who did the Soviet work and French internal politics, who, other than
                    Charles Yost, is probably the most literate ambassador in my book of
                    diplomatists that I served with. Jack Perry would sit at his typewriter, put in
                    the telegram forms and type out a brilliant report that newspaper men would
                    envy, and I wouldn't change a word. Nor would ChiBohlen. Nor would Bob McBride,
                    who had been in France all his life and was an outstanding draftsman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Yes, and not one of them would change Jack's telegrams. None would
                    change Bob Oakley's, who was equally extraordinary. He covered all the Middle
                    East and Africa. He didn't have the talent of typing final copy quite so well,
                    but there's nothing that Bob Oakley didn't know or couldn't find out. He had
                    great rapport with all of the Arab, Israeli and African embassies.</p>
                <p>And then equally brilliant, able, sound was John Gunther Dean, who later was with
                    me in Vietnam. He later became Ambassador to Beirut. He became Ambassador to
                    Denmark. He became Ambassador to India. I don't know where he is now, but he has
                    had more embassies than almost anyone that I know.</p>
                <p>These three men. My job was really to cover the gaps that they might have and to
                    pull it all together. We had not a very strong group on French internal
                    political policy, so I paid more attention to that.</p>
                <p>I was determined when I went to Paris that I would not be surprised by anything
                    Charles DeGaulle did, because he was capable of surprising the United States
                    even more than Khrushchev, I think. DeGaulle's capacity to surprise might
                    include his publicly expressed admiration and respect for Nixon, even when, or
                    perhaps because, Nixon was out of favor and office. During my tour, DeGaulle
                    invited Nixon to the Elys�e for extensive discussion of domestic and
                    international affairs. Prior to the meeting I was invited by Nixon to his hotel
                    suite to brief him on the current political situation in France and on DeGaulle
                    himself. For this I relied heavily on DeGaulle's first and most revealing
                    exposure of his philosophy for leadership and action, “Le Fil de l'Ep�e” (The
                    Edge of the Sword), the English copy of which Nixon borrowed to study. NB:
                    DeGaulle's choice of a passage from Hamlet for his opening quotation always
                    impressed me as a possible key to seminal French-English, if not
                    Churchill-DeGaulle, differences, i.e., “Rightly to be great is not to stir
                    without great argument” becomes in French, “Etre grand, c'est soutenir une
                    grande querelle!” Surely, “argument” suggests reason, while “quarrel” indicates
                    emotion?</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I read everything that Charles DeGaulle wrote. As my first act as Political
                    Counselor, I asked the experts on the political staff to each give me the worst
                    scenario that they could devise as to what Charles DeGaulle could do which would
                    conflict with our policies in the world, domestically, Canada, Russia, China,
                    Africa, what not, and they all turned out some great stuff. I put it all
                    together as a dispatch, but Bob McBride and Bohlen wouldn't let me send it in.
                    Not that they disagreed with sending in the worst that could happen to us:
                    getting NATO kicked out of France, we had that in there. “Free Quebec”. That
                    wasn't too difficult to predict judging by his speeches. Trouble in the Middle
                    East. In Vietnam, “American's get out of Vietnam,” which DeGaulle said in a
                    statement in Cambodia before a cheering mob. He said it was our fault. We had
                    all that in. The one thing that he didn't do that we had in the report was that
                    he would be the first to go to China. And we had it in there, but Nixon did it
                    first. I found out later from the Quai d'Orsay, from the Elys�e, that the
                    General fully intended to be the first to visit China, but he left office before
                    he could do it, and then Nixon took over. But they wouldn't let me send that in
                    on grounds that it might not be kept confidential and that there was such a
                    hatred of Charles DeGaulle in Washington on the Hill that predicting all the
                    terrible things that he might do, even if you're right, might backfire on us and
                    U.S. policy. So I had to send it in “back channel.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this probably is quite correct. It would get
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: “The American Embassy states DeGaulle will fight for Quebec
                    independence, drive NATO out of France and get the Americans out of Vietnam and
                    onto the gold standard.” As I mentioned, I was allowed to send it in, but as a
                    letter to the desk.</p>
                <p>Q: During your time there you were there during a time when DeGaulle was really
                    reasserting what he would say was the rightful role of France in the world, and
                    also were you there during the May of 1968, too?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: I was, yes, during the student riots.</p>
                <p>Q: During the riots. So in a way he got his come-uppance. But as a Political
                    Counselor, how did you deal with these really sort of cataclysmic effects in our
                    policy within France and with France itself?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, the worst crisis, of course, was the student uprising. This was
                    May 1968. And my role, for which Dean Rusk sent me a special congratulatory
                    telegram, was basically to organize all of the resources in the Embassy to
                    report on a daily basis, immediate telegrams, what was going on. Jack Perry
                    would go down and talk to the Communist party leaders and go mingle with the
                    crowds. John Dean would cover the Asians, and Oakley others; they were all out
                    and around town. My job was to go to the Quai d'Orsay and get their information.
                    I got the Economic/Commercial Section to report what was happening to the franc
                    and USIA to cover the media.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We didn't really work, unfortunately, with the CIA. They did their own reporting.
                    We gave them all of our stuff, but I rarely saw any of theirs. They had some
                    very fine contacts.</p>
                <p>The military we worked with, but not too closely. And Dick Walters had excellent
                    sources. The crisis came to a head when DeGaulle disappeared. Sarge Shriver was
                    Ambassador then. Perhaps unfortunately he was a new boy. I'd been there three
                    years, and it was pretty hard to go from Bohlen, who knew everything about the
                    French to Shriver. But Shriver depended more on the staff, and after all, it was
                    a crisis.</p>
                <p>We, I think, reported it, all of the developments as well as we could, extremely
                    fast. That was my role. Unfortunately, the Quai d'Orsay diplomats, when Charles
                    DeGaulle disappeared, weren't very useful. The Military Attach�, Dick Walters,
                    and perhaps to a lesser extent, the Agency, Locke Campbell, who were both very
                    good, had the best information. And to prove that, Sarge Shriver called a rare
                    meeting of all the heads. “Where is DeGaulle?”</p>
                <p>Woody Wallner, who took Bob McBride's place, had inside information from Andre
                    Fontaine, the Le Monde correspondent, and some of the best sources in town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been there during the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Yes. He knew everything. He knew with whom everyone was sleeping,
                    male or female. But he and Shriver never got along. Woody was sort of a
                    caricature of a Europeanized Foreign Service Officer... long cigarette holder,
                    and sort of a sophisticated Elim O'Shaughnessy, laid back, perfect French,
                    totally un-American in Shriver's way. Shriver even put a trampoline in the
                    Residence garden and everybody coming to cocktail parties would jump on the
                    trampoline, most unsophisticated. They reacted very badly to each other.
                    Unfortunately, Woody got the wrong advice from his best contacts saying that
                    DeGaulle was going to either quit or be thrown out. And Shriver, in a very
                    important incident in my diplomatic career, called all of the heads of section
                    together and said, “Where is the General? We have to get into print on that.
                    Katzenbach and others, including Ball, are calling for it. Where is he?”Walters
                    said, “He's in Germany talking to the top Generals, finding out if they will
                    support him if it comes to civil strife.” Walters didn't know whether the
                    military would support him, but he assumed that they would. And that was
                    absolutely correct as later history showed. When the General moved secretly, he
                    moved very well.</p>
                <p>Locke Campbell's Central Intelligence Agency deputy at the meeting was more
                    ambivalent than Walters, but took the position that the General would stay in
                    office. Woody, my boss, took the position that the General was out. “Whether he
                    will fight or whether he doesn't fight, he's out.” I took the position that my
                    Quai d'Orsay contacts and the Political Section's contacts did not know where he
                    had disappeared to.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>At the end of the meeting Shriver said to Woody Wallner, “Write it up.” And
                    Woody, unbeknownst to anyone, sent in a telegram which unfortunately said
                    exactly what he thought, rather than what Dick Walters and the Agency thought.
                    No one really knew how it would come out. After all, he had quit back in 1946
                    when he became disgusted with the political scene. His expression for the
                    student revolt was “chier au lit:” “I will take student and popular opposition,
                    but I won't take chier au lit,” literally “shit in the bed.” It's an old
                    barracks term. I didn't know what it meant, I had to look it up. He could have,
                    in Woody Wallner's view and others, followed precedent and resigned. But he
                    didn't, and came back. And this was a very interesting exercise in foreign
                    policy. But [neither] Shriver nor anyone else in our Embassy saw Woody's
                    telegram. And that caused a great embarrassment in Washington, because
                    Katzenbach immediately had a press conference and said welcome to Charles
                    DeGaulle's successor. It wasn't quite that dramatic, but this was a very
                    interesting exercise in “country team” action.</p>
                <p>The DeGaulle incident exposed a curious example of errors in diplomacy made and
                    compounded by both political appointees and career diplomats at home and abroad.
                    Serious Error #1 was for political-appointee Shriver to demand a categoric
                    message to Washington to show the Embassy knew without question what DeGaulle
                    was up to! Error #2 was the equally positive and equally erroneous information
                    provided to the Ambassador by a most experienced career diplomat in the face of
                    conflicting, interagency intelligence. Error #3 was the impulsive decision of
                    political-appointee Under Secretary Katzenbach to announce prematurely and
                    erroneously to the world that the USG welcomed the new head of state Pompidou,
                    and, Error #4, without his career diplomatic staff in State checking the facts
                    directly with all intelligence sources, including the CIA and Pentagon in
                    Washington with their “back-channel” reports. The irony of the incident was that
                    DeGaulle must have been immensely delighted to have fooled and embarrassed the
                    U.S. once again!</p>
                <p>Under Bohlen I don't think that could have ever happened. Bohlen would have known
                    or would not have given a categoric answer. He would have talked to the General,
                    and he wouldn't have sent out such a telegram unless he had confidence in it.
                    Shriver, being new, wanted a simple conclusion. He was running for Vice
                    President at the time and was only in Paris on a sabbatical. I'm overstating the
                    problem. Ten years later I had occasion to ask Fontaine where he got the
                    inaccurate information that DeGaulle was resigning. His answer, “Pompidou
                    himself!” Whether the Prime Minister wished to prime the pump for his succession
                    of DeGaulle or whether he too had been duped by the General hopefully will be
                    resolved by historians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to dwell more on this, but we will move on.
                        You werassigned first to Rumanian training and then you ended up in
                        Gabon.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, when I came back from Paris after three and a half years, I
                    wanted to stay in Western Europe or Eastern European affairs, where I had
                    developed a certain expertise. And I had served in Rumania early in my career.
                    After War College, I went to the Rumanian Legation as Political Officer and DCM.
                    And with Soviet background, it was to me an obvious move, and I asked if I could
                    be assigned there. And, indeed, was, but later in 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be as Ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: This would be as Ambassador after Vietnam, not Paris. Bill Rogers put
                    me up for the mission in Rumania, and the President approved. But then we had a
                    little change in Secretaries of State, and Bill Rogers found that Henry
                    Kissinger wanted his job and managed to push him out. Henry had his own man,
                    Harry Barnes, very fine, whom he'd dealt with when he'd been in Rumania with
                    President Nixon, and I didn't get the job.</p>
                <p>I'm jumping the gun. I took Rumanian after Paris hoping to go there, but that
                    never really came to fruition. Idar Rimestad (Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Administration) said, “Look, the only Embassy open at this time is Gabon. Do you
                    want it or not? There are ten men who want it.” I didn't really want to go to
                    the heart of darkness, but if you're going to live once on Earth you might as
                    well see the world. And I'll never regret it. It was an eye-opener.</p>
                <p>But then when I came back from Gabon and Vietnam, that's when Rogers and Nixon
                    put me up for Rumania again. I did have Rumanian at the three/three level. But
                    my loss was one of the best things that ever happened in my career. I tell young
                    Foreign Service Officers, “If you're turned down or don't get what you want, you
                    may be lucky.” And cite my example.</p>
                <p>After declining consideration for another Third World mission, I finally asked if
                    I could go to Edinburgh as Consul General, because the North Sea oil was coming
                    in, I was an oil expert and it was a key spot to be in. We also had important
                    political work; Scottish nationalism was really getting very virulent, and
                    separation from the UK possible. Also it was the first English-speaking country
                    that I'd ever been assigned to, except Cairo is really English-speaking. And I'm
                    a golfer. So I asked to go to Edinburgh. Well, I'm now a member at St. Andrews
                    and Muirfield Golf Clubs. And in so far as my life, my family and my career were
                    concerned, no post was more rewarding, certainly more rewarding than being
                    Ambassador to Gabon where I really had so little to do. The following letter to
                    the Editor of the Foreign Service Journal appeared in the March 1997 issue:
                    “During the Nixon presidency, the White House insisted on compiling overseas
                    reactions to Nixon's foreign policy speeches...On one occasion, AmEmbassy
                    Libreville's...reply was short, and particularly honest...'Gabon slept on',
                    wrote Ambassador Funkhouser. John C. Garon, Retired FSO, Bethesda,
                    Maryland.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues in Gabon?</hi>

                <p>FUNKHOUSER: There weren't any. I asked to leave.</p>

                    had something constructive to report because Gabon was supporting the Biafrans.
                    The French, of course, were still pseudo-colonists running Gabon. And they were
                    supporting Biafra. So at least we had some useful reporting to do on the other
                    side of the war. That was really the only issue that I thought commanded
                    attention of the State Department. It was so uneventful there.</p>
                <p>It's one of the richest countries in the world. It was well run. And unlike one
                    of my predecessors, who wanted to make Gabon into a non-French controlled,
                    totally independent country like many of its neighbors who have gone down the
                    drain, I was not interested in overthrowing in any way or participating in the
                    overthrow of President Bongo, who was doing a reasonable job. I think I had, and
                    this is for young Service officers, far more authority and far more interesting
                    work as a Third Secretary in Paris doing the oil work, and certainly in the
                    Middle East as Third Secretary, than as Ambassador. I asked to leave after a
                    year, and was offered Vietnam. I accepted with relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do? You went to Vietnam in August or
                        something,1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: I was one year in Africa, and one year was fine. One year's enough. I
                    was offered what they called the DEPCORDS position in the Saigon Military
                    Region, which went from the Cambodian border through Saigon to the delta. We had
                    what was a “Pacification Program,” so-called, where we were trying to win the
                    minds and the hearts of the people. It was a very serious operation in which,
                    the fighting military aside, all of the rest of the infrastructure of Vietnam
                    was subject to American pressure to run the country well. Now this means we had
                    responsibility for the roads, for the schools, for the hospitals, for the local
                    militia of old men, old women and children who were left alone in the exposed
                    villages when the young men went off to fight with the ARVN. There was a General
                    in each of the military regions. A three-star General, Mike Davison, was my
                    boss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about American generals?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: American generals. We're only talking about the American side now,
                    but it was a bipartite, layered operation: American three-star general, State
                    Department ex-ambassador or FSO-1, two-star so-called. Then an American General
                    one-star, and then a State Department Minister, Counselor or Foreign Service
                    Officer, Class 2. Defense and State were layered in each of the military
                    regions. Perhaps the most unusual feature of this command structure was that the
                    civilian Depcords also served as Senior Advisor to the Commanding General in
                    each of the four Military Regions in South Vietnam. When the Commanding General
                    of Military Region III (Third Regional Advisory Command), Lieutenant General
                    Wagstaff, was on leave for five weeks in late 1971, I acted in his place with
                    the assimilated rank of Major General, officially in charge of some 90,000 Free
                    World Forces (U.S., Australia, Korea). I, of course, deferred military decisions
                    to the military officers under me, but signed all orders as “Acting”. I presume
                    that civilian control of the military, e.g., Presidents, Secretaries of Defense
                    et al, provided the precedent, but the role and responsibility was to me unique
                    for a Foreign Service Officer. John Gunther Dean was in one area. Charlie
                    Whitehouse was my predecessor. And each of us had something like 1800 Americans
                    working for us trying to keep the country moving, operating and reasonably
                    democratic on a year and a half assignment. I went from being in charge of an
                    Embassy with ten or eleven people to an operation with 1800 Americans and an
                    equal number of Vietnamese trying to build the infrastructure of the country.
                    (Cf. my article in the 7/97 issue of the Foreign Service Journal, “Speaking
                    Out,” which contains the excellent advice of how to run an organization of
                    thousands which I sought from the former Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Administration, Idar Rimestad.)</p>
                <p>Q: How did you feel about it? Let's put it back at the time in retrospect. Sort
                    of the American way of trying to remake a country, a foreign ideology. You know,
                    it was just a different country, different people.</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, all I can say to that was I was fully supportive of what Dean
                    Rusk was trying to do insofar as foreign policy and the Pacification Program was
                    concerned. Helping the country; the hospitals, the roads, the schools. It had to
                    be done. Trying to protect the villages. Getting the local militia to defend the
                    villages. I would attend the military meetings, of course, with General Abrams
                    and see that we always knew what the armed forces were doing. But it was very
                    easy to identify with the fact that the job had to be done, as long as the
                    policy was what the policy was, i.e., to stop “dominos” from falling to the
                    communists.</p>
                <p>At the end, I had a really serious difference of opinion with my superiors in
                    Saigon. Not with the Embassy or Bill Colby, who had left as the Ambassador in
                    charge of the Pacification Program, but with some of the military. I, having
                    been there a year, made the strongest possible pitch with my Saigon bosses, with
                    three-star General Mike Davison's support. “Start getting the Americans out of
                    the country. Leave one advisor per Province, but don't have 50 colonels, some of
                    them retired and “double-dipping” their salaries, advising a Vietnamese District
                    Commander how to run his war.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Our Vietnamese commanding officers were at that time extremely good in Military
                    Region Three. They didn't need advice. They needed guns and ammunition, what
                    not, but they knew how to fight the Viet Cong just as well as we did. And I
                    almost got removed from Vietnam by the top military brass, because I refused to
                    put in a budget for 50 advisors where we only needed one. As reported to the
                    State Department inspectors February 15, 1972, General Davison and Ambassador
                    Colby, my two immediate superiors, fully supported my May 15, 1971
                    recommendation for immediate reduction of American advisors. In Military Region
                    III I cut the Cords organization from over 1700 civilian employees as of January
                    1, 1971, to under 500 twelve months later. Unfortunately, Davison's and Colby's
                    successors changed this policy.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this for bureaucratic reasons? I'm talking about the impetus from our
                    military. Or is it they didn't trust, have confidence, in the Vietnamese, or is
                    it just the way we do things?</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: It's the way we do things. More was better. If we're not winning, put
                    more in. It was quantity, not quality. Military Region Three stood up best. We
                    did remove a bunch of the advisors. It also destroyed me spiritually to see the
                    American cornucopia being poured into a rathole, basically.</p>
                <p>My budget was one paragraph. I got anything I wanted. I didn't want it. “Just
                    write a figure in.” It was 'anything goes.' And to a Foreign Service Officer who
                    is used to saving money - in the old days by writing out longhand on
                    one-time-pads to make your phrases more succinct. I couldn't understand it, and
                    I didn't want to see the waste continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you left Vietnam after a tour of a year and a half?
                        Did yofeel that things were going wrong by the time you'd left or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Oh, I did some reports on that for the Department. Marshall Green
                    asked me to summarize where we stood, and I did it in terms of a football game.
                    Letter to Assistant Secretary Green 1/20/72,</p>
                <p>“OFFENSE: North is clearly 7-14 points stronger...DEFENSE: Both strong but
                    neither has been truly tested in a one-to-one match-up. that is, without
                    involvement (of outside powers)...SPECIAL UNITS: here the North has an
                    established 12-point advantage... publicity...media... unsportsmanship conduct
                    and foul play...In summary, South remains a 2-4 touchdown underdog in any
                    head-to-head match today...” Three months later Marshall Green asked me for an
                    update he could show to President Nixon which would answer his question, “Can
                    the GVN hack it?” My conclusion dated 3/10/72, assuming continued U.S. material
                    and military support, was “a fragile affirmative.”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>They were in our territory, but we were holding our own. I thought that the ARVN,
                    the Vietnamese military, would stand up much better. They stood up extremely
                    well in our area. And I really thought that the Vietnamese could hold their own
                    if we pulled out gradually. Start the movement out soon. And I thought that
                    they'd hold. But we didn't pull out really that fast. And I was relatively
                    confident and, as it turned out, wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Region Number Three was certainly the last to hold
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: South Vietnam collapsed from the top, Regions One anTwo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, here was a case of the State Department,
                        thCIA and the Army working together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Excellently under Bunker, a great Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Q: At your level you were saying really with the military, not the military you
                    were working with in Region Three, but the military from the top, that was
                    trying to force more support on the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Individuals on some individual basis. That was it. Who knows? I could
                    be wrong. But we all worked extremely well together under Bunker. My only doubts
                    about the superior U.S. diplomatic and military leadership during my tour in
                    Vietnam was how they could not have convinced Washington to get out sooner. Of
                    course, they may well have except for the impossible question of how to do it
                    with minimal loss to our national interest. I was not privy to their personal
                    advice to Washington. I became convinced we just were in the wrong war at the
                    wrong place and never should have been there. Once having gotten in, we were in
                    a hopeless position without winning it. And the television, of course, made it
                    too graphic to the American public what it was like there.</p>
                <p>The one argument in support of our role in Vietnam which never failed me in later
                    speeches and conversations was that I hoped America would always be on the side
                    towards which women and children ran in terror. Refugees never ran north!</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have problems with the young officers? I'm speaking of Foreign Service
                    Officers coming out to CORDS, which certainly was not exactly what they had
                    thought of diplomatic life being like.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: On an individual basis, some officers were so opposed to the war that
                    I didn't think that they could do their job properly. It's not your job to make
                    policy. You're out here, you've got to do the best you can. Report anything you
                    want, were my instructions to all my staffs anywhere, particularly in Paris.
                    Jack Perry, for example, was strongly against the involvement in Vietnam. I
                    wasn't. I was a “hard hat.”</p>
                <p>My formative years in diplomacy were molded by successful U.S. policy of
                    resisting Communist expansion globally, e.g., Marshall Plan, Berlin airlift,
                    Cuba. In Korea, Communist tanks invaded the South; in Vietnam, Communist
                    aggressors moved more subtlely, by osmosis. I believed the “domino theory.” I
                    said, “Anybody on the staff, write what you want. You sign it. I'll send it in.
                    I don't have to agree with you.” And Jack Perry wrote a brilliant dispatch from
                    the Paris optic on why this was a most unfortunate policy. He sent it in. Same
                    in Vietnam. “If you don't agree, put it down in writing, but don't let that
                    change your job. You're here to do the job.” The trouble with most of the State
                    Department officers in Vietnam, I didn't feel this way because I volunteered and
                    was in a top position, was that they felt that they had done something wrong or
                    they wouldn't be in Vietnam. In other words, if you're expendable, go to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly at that time of experience. It was found that
                        thiwas not the road upwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Although some of us who were DEPCORDS: John Dean, Charlie Whitehouse
                    went on to a couple of Embassies. John Dean went on to four or five. At the
                    lower level? Those that had studied Vietnamese, of course, and we had some
                    brilliant officers, were in paradise. They had all the best sources. They were
                    listened to. Four-star Generals would listen to Third Secretaries (language
                    officers).</p>
                <p>Q: Well, Mr. Ambassador, I would like to continue this, but I know that you are
                    under some time constraints. There are two questions that I try to ask of senior
                    officers. One is what do you think was your greatest accomplishment in the
                    Foreign Service, and the counterpoint is your greatest frustration.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, my greatest accomplishment was, and the one that had the most
                    impact on the United States, was in my experience as a Third Secretary, first as
                    Regional Petroleum Officer for the entire Middle East, and then as Petroleum
                    Advisor in NEA in the late '40s and early '50s, where with some help, but not
                    much, I was responsible for overall policy with respect to oil concessions in
                    the Middle East, out of which developed the so-called “fifty-fifty” contract,
                    which lasted for 25 years. That's written up in Congressional Reports when I
                    testified on the Hill and my dispatches were all put into that record. There
                    were a couple of Top Secret dispatches I did on Saudi Arabia which disappeared
                    in the files. I got all of the concession contracts, and my Top Secret reports
                    showed where concession areas were still open. Mainly under the Persian Gulf, as
                    at Lake Maricaibo. But my work there, undoubtedly had more influence on the
                    United States and the world, I think, than certainly anything else I've done,
                    that I was involved in. And it's all in the record. My government and industry
                    paper on international oil affairs are now housed in the Oil and Gas Institute
                    of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, where I last served both as a
                    diplomat and subsequently as International Affairs Advisor for a Texas oil
                    company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And on the disappointment, frustration side? Do you have
                        anthat you can think of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, you're always worried when you're in an unhealthy environment,
                    such as some of the Middle East countries, that you and your family are going to
                    get sick. I have had all the dysenteries, but fortunately my health has stood
                    up. It's always difficult for a wife to be in a place like Moscow, and your
                    children. It is impossible for me to generalize whether foreign service is a
                    greater family risk than domestic. Despite recent claims of some Foreign Service
                    wives for work/hardship pay because of risks abroad, I have heard of none, in
                    contrast to Washington, who have been raped abroad. Our first son died in a car
                    accident, but in the U.S. My wife suffered spinal injuries from a plane crash in
                    Rome, but in an American plane. Her several miscarriages occurred both at home
                    and abroad. In education, my children skipped grades when returning to St.
                    Albans, Exeter, and Harvard. Somehow I felt my family was safer in Bien Hoa,
                    Vietnam, during the war than in Georgetown!</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Foreign hardships in my career were more than offset by the adventure, the
                    believed contribution to something greater, the privileged level of social and
                    professional engagement, however low it might be in some circumstances, the
                    amenities such as our first billet in 1945, a suite at the Crillon in Paris, to
                    say nothing of good and bad servants when there is diplomatic work to be done,
                    new quarters to make into homes and young children to raise...and not forgetting
                    tax-free booze! I wouldn't say frustration. Disappointment. Well, I was terribly
                    disappointed not to be named Ambassador to Rumania, but it couldn't have worked
                    out better. I have more real friends now. Our fortieth wedding anniversary was
                    in Scotland. The joy of making lasting friends. My friends in other countries
                    have not lasted. Five years in France, but I really have even stopped sending
                    Christmas cards. Let's face it, an English-speaking, Western civilization
                    country is the place to be. I was frustrated by having my name pulled from
                    Rumania but, without doubt, it was one of the greatest things that ever happened
                    to me, if you keep your health. I've also had a lot of luck with being Political
                    Counselor in Paris and Economic Counselor in Moscow, probably unique in the
                    Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting posts and interesting jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Even Gabon, I loved it for one year. It is a tropical rain forest,
                    the heart of darkness. I found out I had a distant relative who opened up the
                    Schweitzer hospital at Lamberene on the Ogowe there back in 1856, Robert Hamill
                    Nassau. I'd hate to live on the Earth without having seen Gabon.</p>
                <p>Oh, it's a frustration whenever you're waiting for an assignment, when you're
                    walking the corridors. Walking the corridors waiting for a good job is still the
                    most frustrating thing for a Foreign Service Officer. Not to know where he's
                    going to go and not to know what his life is going to be like. That's probably
                    gotten much worse now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, things have changed, but would you recommend the
                        ForeigService as a career to a young person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: My daughter's in it and my son-in-law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is your daughter stationed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Well, they're both still in Washington. They're just new in the
                    Service. She went to Harvard and Pushkin Institute in Moscow and she speaks
                    fluent French and Russian. And she married a man that she met in the Service
                    whose father was a USIA officer. Sure, I'd recommend it. Ten years later I've
                    changed my mind. My daughter is divorced and has left the Foreign Service. Wives
                    are not rated for their work in efficiency reports nor are they expected to help
                    their husbands and the Embassy mission. Social/political agendas reportedly have
                    overtaken the promotions and professionalism I knew in the State Department.
                    They don't have the rich life that we did. You could be stupid when I was a
                    young Foreign Service Officer, and the fact that the United States was so
                    overwhelmingly powerful made you an oracle in any society. Sort of like the nose
                    of a rocket going up. No matter who you were, you had infinite power behind you
                    after World War II. Now it's quite different. Plus the fact you can get
                    shot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FUNKHOUSER: Not at all. It was a pleasure to talk about these matters. Distaff: A
                    glaring and unforgivable omission in this oral history is failure to emphasize
                    the vital role played during my diplomatic career by my incomparable wife
                    Phyllis through, as my colleagues will attest, her beauty, wit, uncommon common
                    sense and requited love. There are many priceless anecdotes to relate, but the
                    following is one of the more memorable with which to end these Footnotes.</p>
                <p>POSTSCRIPT</p>
                <p>Concerning memorable encounters at official French government farewell dinners
                    for Ambassador Charles Bohlen at the Quai d'Orsay and Elys�e Palace.</p>
                <p>The French Foreign Minister, Couve de Murville, hosted a huge, sumptuous dinner
                    party, as only the French can do, December 1967 at the palatial Quai d'Orsay,
                    their Foreign Office. The seating was for perhaps 100; the tables, service,
                    liveried waiters, silver, crystal, menu breathtaking. Beautiful ladies were in
                    resplendent gowns and jewels; diplomats in white tie, uniforms, decorations.</p>
                <p>For the occasion the high-ranking French ladies followed the custom of being
                    dressed by the best fashion houses and jeweled to match. My lovely wife,
                    together with several other Embassy wives, were similarly offered the loan of
                    appropriate jewels from the famous shop of Harry Winston off the Champs Elys�e.
                    My wife resisted a too spectacular offering, but chose a discrete but fabulous
                    (for her) diamond necklace with the most interesting, following results.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>At the mile-long table her dinner companion, Baron Rothschild, asked why he had
                    not met her before in Paris or on the Riviera and looked forward to further
                    encounters. For my part I was astonished to have the Foreign Minister himself
                    who had never laid eyes on me before approach me after dinner and engage me in
                    conversation alone for an extended period! As Political Counselor I was one of
                    the lower ranking diplomats at the dinner. It created talk which led inter alia
                    to a subsequent conversation with the Embassy Military Attache, General Vernon
                    Walters (later Ambassador to Germany, CIA Director, etc.) in which he
                    volunteered that I was destined to have any Ambassadorship I wished (sic)...he
                    recommended Rio where he had served with distinction as Military Attach�.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, President DeGaulle entertained the Bohlens at an even more
                    impressive, but more exclusive, dinner at his residence, the Elys�e Palace.
                    Again, following dinner I (and all others present) was dumbfounded to see the
                    Chief of Protocol approach me and announce that the President wished to speak to
                    me! As the room parted, I was ushered up to the towering General who spoke to me
                    “in private” while the guests watched. I have recounted the conversation
                    elsewhere, but suffice it to say he wished to emphasize the point that the
                    United States would be making a grave error ever to consider relationships with
                    Asian countries on the level with Europe because of fundamental and irredeemable
                    differences in cultural heritage. I expressed great appreciation for his message
                    and undertook to pass it to my superiors but managed a meek response that
                    Americans unfortunately might find it difficult to accept in view of our
                    traditional claim to be a “melting pot” of immigrants and frontiers East as well
                    as West. When I staggered back to those I had been talking to, the French
                    Director of Political Affairs, Jacques de Beaumarchais, was discrete enough not
                    to inquire re the conversation but only to remark, “Now you have your book!”</p>
                <p>Diplomatic lesson: Even with insufferable conceit, there is no plausible
                    explanation for the foregoing events other than the Winston necklace on my wife!
                    French diplomat/author Peyrefitte should have added to his famous aphorism on
                    how to succeed in diplomacy, “Il faut �tre un peu sceptique, cynique, ironique
                    [French: One must be a little bit skeptical, cynical, and ironic]”...”et riche
                    [French: and rich]!”</p>
