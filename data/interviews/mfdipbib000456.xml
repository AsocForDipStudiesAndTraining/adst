                <p>AMBASSADOR BRANDON H. GROVE, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas Stern </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 14, 1994</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Preface</p>
                <p>The Cold War began on July 2, 1947 when Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov led his
                    delegation out of the conference in Paris that launched the Marshall Plan for
                    European recovery. It ended on December 25, 1991 with Gorbachev's resignation as
                    president of the USSR, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. It
                    encompassed whole careers. Someone like myself, who was 18 in 1947, was 62 when
                    the struggle ended. Rarely is a defining period in history so sharply
                    delineated.</p>
                <p>This memoir is based on an expansion of and additions to oral history interviews.
                    It attempts to convey what it meant to me to be a Foreign Service officer during
                    the Cold War years of 1959-1991. Waging cold war was the chief activity of our
                    government in its foreign, defense, and intelligence policies, and in many areas
                    of our national economy as well. From vantage points during assignments abroad
                    and in Washington, I will describe how widespread and engrossing that costly war
                    quickly became.</p>
                <p>My perspective is that of only one of many Americans whose foreign service
                    careers span this nearly 45-year chapter in world history. We served our country
                    during a global struggle understood by many policy makers and large large
                    portions of the American people as a contest between good and evil, “us and
                    them,” the right side winning in the end without a global holocaust. Certain of
                    the justness of our causes, we had prevailed in the century's two great wars
                    before its mid-point, and established ourselves as the preeminent world
                    power.</p>
                <p>Sands of Iwo Jima, the enduringly successful John Wayne movie with its famous
                    flag raising scene, was released in 1949. Four years after the end of World War
                    II, it offered audiences early in the Cold War an inspiring tale of US Marines
                    inching their way to hard-won victory. For these audiences a different struggle
                    against quite a different enemy was beginning. For nearly half a century it
                    would require the dedication and sacrifice extolled in this film.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>This time we would be “containers,” in George Kennan's word, and our enemies
                    would be “contained” in their expansionist ambitions, not overrun. This concept
                    suggests a subtle edge of superiority for those doing the containing, an implied
                    military and moral advantage for the West, even if the moral aspect would lose
                    its luster during the conflict in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Only during local wars in Korea and Vietnam would we become engaged in military
                    conflict—through surrogates—with our Cold War enemy. Berlin's occupation status
                    would be kept intact until the wall came down without a struggle. Japan, freed
                    of Soviet influence, would become a vital democracy, an economic power rivaling
                    Western Europe and America.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Cold War, we and the Russians lived with the possibility of
                    nuclear strikes and counter-strikes that were always, although not inevitably,
                    avoided. This is the highest tribute to the efficacy of great power diplomacy,
                    backed by overwhelming military might on both sides, in dealing with situations
                    of brinkmanship, misunderstanding, terrible mistakes, posturing, and deception.
                    On both sides, fundamental values were rightly considered at stake. The outcome
                    of the Cuban missile crisis speaks to the success of such high-risk diplomacy.
                    In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in December, 1950 William Faulkner said of
                    these times, “Our tragedy today is a general and universal fear so long
                    sustained by now that we can even bear it. There are no longer problems of the
                    spirit. There is only the question: When will I be blown up?”</p>
                <p>Today, with the Cold War behind us, “the enemy” is harder to identify and
                    confront. The clear-cut differences are gone. A moral basis for international
                    engagement has eroded since the Vietnamese war. Political will and popular
                    support are difficult to mobilize in the absence of an obvious threat to our
                    security. There is little public understanding of the need to commit resources
                    to preventive diplomacy, which seeks to defuse a problem before it gets beyond
                    control, and is therefore based on hard-to-sell speculation about what might
                    happen in the future.</p>
                <p>At the end of the most violent century in history, and in the early stages of an
                    information revolution that makes violence harder to conceal, much of the world
                    now favors democracy and free-market economies in a global marketplace.
                    Breathtaking possibilities for humanity are in reach without the prospect of
                    global conflict. Even as we push ahead, we need to pause and assess these last
                    fifty years, which have placed us all where we are today. A comprehensive
                    understanding of the Cold War on which most people could agree is still beyond
                    reach. The review by scholars of emerging historical records of the past half
                    century exposes subtleties, ambivalences, and misperceptions on both sides that
                    compel a much more complex appreciation of the Cold War. Questions of whether it
                    could have been ended sooner, and been less costly to both sides, will trouble
                    us for a long time to come.</p>

                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Here, I retrace worn footpaths in dappled light, pausing occasionally to kick
                    aside dry leaves and offer some observations about issues that engaged Americans
                    during the Cold War, and the unavoidable untidiness of foreign policy-making in
                    our democracy. Diplomacy, itself, is the management of international relations
                    by negotiation, whether around a conference table or in less formal conversation
                    between representatives of different governments. Given my experience, I found
                    it natural to answer the question: What does a diplomat do? I recall why I chose
                    a foreign service career and share thoughts and feelings about places in which I
                    served, how things worked (or failed to work) and a few of the extraordinary
                    people I met along the way—some of the heroes and villains of our times. This is
                    also a story of the human side of Foreign Service life.</p>
                <p>I write this with appreciation and affection for many friends and colleagues of
                    great abilities, American and foreign alike, with whom I served during these
                    perilous years. I am grateful to the countless people who have helped me in my
                    work, kept me from foolish courses, and stood by me when our views were not in
                    fashion.</p>
                <p>My love and tenderest thanks go to my mother and father now at rest, and to my
                    wife Mariana and our family. Without their trusting love and companionship,
                    acceptance of foreign service life, and the private joys they have given me,
                    often without knowing, I could not endure the obstacles facing anyone working in
                    diplomacy. How often while traveling alone have I returned at the end of the day
                    to the silence of empty rooms and mutely asked, “Where is everybody?”</p>

                        collection. Let me start by asking you about your life before you joined the

                <p>1EARLY YEARS</p>
                <p>A. Growing Up in Chicago</p>
                <p>GROVE: Vladimir Nabokov, in his autobiography, characterizes our existence as a
                    brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness. My friend David
                    Ginsburg believes the opposite: the dark is for our earthly lives. In either
                    case, I entered this crack in Chicago early on the morning of April 8, 1929.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Herbert Hoover had become president. The stock market crash and Great Depression
                    were six months away. That year, congress, having failed to support the League
                    of Nations ten years earlier, ratified a toothless Kellogg-Briand Pact,
                    sponsored by the US and France to abolish wars through preventive diplomacy and
                    conflict resolution. Sixty-two nations, including Germany and Japan, signed the
                    agreement. World War II, nevertheless, loomed a mere decade ahead. Five years
                    earlier, in 1924, congress passed the Rogers Act creating a “Foreign Service of
                    the United States,” in which I would invest 35 years of my working life.</p>
                <p>Joseph Stalin expelled Leon Trotsky from the Soviet Union in 1929, consolidating
                    power he would use for good in fighting Hitler, and evil in the Cold War. Soon I
                    would experience Nazi Germany at first hand. My entire diplomatic career would
                    be influenced by the power struggles of the Cold War. Arabs in Jerusalem
                    attacked Jews at the Wailing Wall in 1929, killing many in the first large-scale
                    violence of its kind. For three years, I would deal with this relationship. In
                    Washington, the Teapot Dome bribery investigation was at its height.</p>
                <p>Herblock began drawing political cartoons for the Chicago Daily News, as Al
                    (”Scarface”) Capone presided over Chicago's crime syndicates. Blondie and Popeye
                    first appeared in the funny pages, and the new yo-yo's were a national
                    obsession. William Faulkner, whom I would come to know, published As I Lay
                    Dying. Cole Porter asked life's burning question, “What is This Thing Called
                    Love?” Large, luscious candy bars were three for ten cents, and local movie
                    shows cost about the same. Everyone shopped at Woolworth's five-and-dime
                    stores.</p>
                <p>Half our population was made up of first generation immigrants like my Polish
                    mother. In 1929, veterans of the Civil War were still alive. Our flag had only
                    48 stars, six rows of eight. During my working years, the population of the
                    United States more than doubled, transforming our social policies, altering the
                    character and purposes of our cities, and overwhelming many of America's small
                    towns and their yester-yearly ways. Population growth is the biggest challenge,
                    worldwide.</p>
                <p>What little I know about my mother Helena's family I learned from my cousin,
                    Wojciech Gasparski, a professor of humanities and praxeology in Warsaw. Family
                    records were destroyed during World War II. My grandfather Jan worked at the
                    turn of the century as a furniture craftsman, an upholsterer who with my
                    grandmother Franciszka had four children. A son, Stanislaw, was killed in World
                    War I. Their daughter Maria was a schoolteacher who died of tuberculosis at 26;
                    I remember mother's wistful references to her. Another son, Wladislaw, became a
                    typographer, journalist, and actor. In 1910, Wladek moved from Warsaw, then
                    under Russian domination, to Galicia in southeastern Poland under
                    Austro-Hungarian rule, to avoid military service in the Russian army.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I came to know my uncle Wladek, who visited my parents in London for several
                    months in 1958 while I was staying with them and waiting to enter the Foreign
                    Service. His status as a pensioner permitted him to leave Poland temporarily.
                    Our common language was German, and I took him around London. After living so
                    long under Nazi and Soviet oppression in Poland, he was deeply affected by
                    British freedoms and prosperity. He never thought of staying, however, and was
                    anxious toward the end of his visit to return to Warsaw and his small family
                    farm nearby. We had a favorite pub in Brompton Road, near Harrods, where we
                    usually ended our morning excursions. It is no longer there, but when I pass the
                    Brompton Oratory I remember Wladek.</p>
                <p>My cousin has two books with “H. Gasparska” written on the fly leaf, left by
                    mother in Warsaw before she came to the United States in 1923. One is on Polish
                    calisthenics. She taught aerobics in Warsaw, and to her delight was awarded a
                    scholarship by the American YWCA to study and teach gymnastic dance in Chicago.
                    The other is called The Charm of the Impossible, by Margaret Slattery, which
                    mother was apparently studying to learn English. Did she feel the title apt as
                    she prepared to sail—a daring woman of 25 changing her life and language—to
                    Ellis Island, and a continent about which she knew so little and where she yet
                    had no friends? This prospect, if she thought of it at all, must have seemed
                    “impossible” until the YWCA took an interest in her.</p>
                <p>My father, the first of eight children in the marriage of a civil engineer,
                    Harper Grove, to Elizabeth Hambright, was born in Brooklyn in 1903. In those
                    days, there was farmland left in Brooklyn. During her pregnancy, my grandmother
                    went to the theater and was smitten by a British actor named Brandon Tyne—so
                    much so, that she named her first-born after him which is how I acquired the
                    name. It was an unusual first name until recently. A young woman at a cocktail
                    party in graduate school told me Brandon Grove sounded like a seaside resort on
                    the coast of England, and she was right. Because we lived abroad when I was a
                    boy, and then in Washington DC, I never knew my grandparents well. I associate
                    my grandfather with a hearing aid, and my grandmother with the best meatloaf and
                    baked beans with ketchup in the world. In Chicago, she was captain of the
                    neighborhood women's bowling team. With characteristic Grove stubbornness and
                    adherence to what is thought to be true, my grandfather stopped working on the
                    Chicago subway construction project because he believed the mayor's office was
                    cheating on the quality of cement in the tunnel walls, and they would soon
                    collapse. They haven't yet.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>My mother and father met in a classroom at the University of Chicago. They were
                    seated alphabetically, both names beginning with the letter G. In the spring of
                    1929, my father, until then not much of a scholar, was studying for his Ph.D. in
                    geology and paleontology at the university; he had found his calling, and
                    pursued it with intellectual vigor until he died at 85. At night, he sorted mail
                    in the post office to help provide for us. We lived on Kimbark Avenue, near the
                    university chapel. My mother, whose English became fluent and without accent,
                    worked at a relief center during the Depression, where Polish was needed to
                    communicate with first generation immigrants. Because she and my father had
                    steady government incomes, my parents fared better than many others during those
                    hard years.</p>
                <p>My forebears on the Grove side came from Switzerland and Germany. They settled
                    into Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1696, and also parts of Virginia near
                    Luray in the Shenandoah Valley. Many were Mennonites who had fled to America's
                    shores to avoid religious persecution. One of these was Hans Graf, born in
                    Switzerland in 1661, who laid out Earl Township on land he bought from the sons
                    of William Penn. He established a trading post with the Indians, exchanging
                    blankets for furs which he then “hauled to Philadelphia on a stout wagon drawn
                    by six powerful horses.”</p>
                <p>Family members on my grandmother Hambright's side set sail from Rotterdam in the
                    St Andrew, which landed in Philadelphia in October, 1738, a year in which there
                    was an influx of German pioneers. Conditions on board were terrible, according
                    to newspaper accounts: “The love for great gain caused [Captain] Steadman to
                    lodge the poor passengers like herrings, and as too many had not room between
                    decks, he kept abundance of them upon deck; and sailing to the Southward, where
                    people were at once out of their climate, and for want of water and room, became
                    sick and died very fast...”</p>
                <p>After the defeat of Generals Braddock and Washington by the French in 1755,
                    Indian marauders roamed through the frontiers of Pennsylvania, where some of the
                    Hambrights had settled, burning their cabins and scalping their families.
                    Captain John Hambright, a frontier Indian fighter, was ordered the following
                    year “to march with a party of two sergeants, two corporals, and 38 private men
                    under your command to attack, burn and destroy any Indian town or towns, with
                    their inhabitants, on the West Branch of the Susquehanna...”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Both families bore professional soldiers who fought as officers and privates in
                    the War of 1812, the French and Indian War, the Revolutionary War, and all of
                    America's other major wars. Colonel Frederick Hambright was a member of the
                    Continental Congress; Captain Henry Hambright's commission was signed by
                    Benjamin Franklin at that Congress. Among the soldiers from Lancaster County who
                    fought in the American Revolution were Samuel, John, Michael and Alexander
                    Grove, along with Abraham and Henry Hambright. Fondness for local political
                    office is a characteristic of these families. But mostly they were farmers, land
                    and dairy owners, tanners, millers, brewers, merchants and teachers, as were so
                    many other ordinary Americans who settled in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Their
                    Protestantism remained strong: my great-grandfather, born in 1854, was named
                    Martin Luther Grove by his parents.</p>
                <p>At an early age, I went to the University of Chicago's experimental Lab School,
                    run according to the principles of John Dewey, which also shaped the educational
                    philosophy of Bard College from which I later graduated. My leading kindergarten
                    memory is of being thrilled and terrified one day by Indians who visited us in
                    feathered dress to speak and dance before the class. Indian culture was an
                    immediate part of life in Illinois.</p>
                <p>For a brief time when I was about ten, and had long before left Chicago, we also
                    lived for nine months in Oklahoma City, where I went to the first of three
                    Woodrow Wilson schools I would attend. The former president's name resonated in
                    those prewar years. My father spent weekends bunking in oil camps at the rigs,
                    learning the oil business from that vital end. My friends and I played on vacant
                    lots near school, which we quite naturally called prairies.</p>
                <p>Children's games reflect their times. In my young years it was “us” and “them,”
                    good guys fighting bad in a polarized world of cowboys and Indians, cops and
                    robbers. We never thought of it that way, of course, but like everyone else in
                    these games I preferred to be the winning cop or cowboy. Girls were usually
                    nurses, caring for us when we had been winged by bullets. We had neither
                    television nor computers to distract us. Other entertainment consisted of going
                    to the movies, which ran cowboy serials with the regular fare, and listening to
                    programs like “The Lone Ranger” or “The Shadow” on immense radios housed in
                    wooden cabinets shaped like Gothic churches. The world around us was a
                    grown-up's world in which we were children striving to become adults, who seemed
                    to be having more fun. In entertainment as elsewhere, there was little catering
                    to the tastes of teenagers and those even younger.</p>
                <p>It was a time of corduroy knickers that made whooshing sounds as the baggy parts
                    rubbed together when you walked. In cold weather, fathers and sons wore leather
                    jackets lined with sheepskin whose tightly curled wool collars had an oily smell
                    that was comforting and sweet, and the boys sported leather Lindbergh-style
                    flying helmets that strapped below the chin. Lindbergh's flight to Paris in 1927
                    was legendary; the kidnaping of his son five years later would haunt families
                    for a long time to come. There were lectures from parents about speaking to
                    strangers; I was certain before falling asleep that a kidnapper would climb
                    through the window or was already under my bed.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>B Nazi Germany, Holland and Spain</p>
                <p>After my father received his doctorate from the University of Chicago, he joined
                    Socony-Vacuum Oil Company as a field geologist. He was sent to Germany, and for
                    the next three years, from 1935-38, we lived in Hamburg. My formal schooling
                    began in German at the Bertram Schule, the last private school in Hamburg the
                    Nazis permitted to remain open.</p>
                <p>We lived in an Italianate villa at Harvestehudeweg 57, and school was just two
                    doors away. This home, with its large rooms and solid burgher presence, through
                    whose garden fence I peered again after the war, was built to please a
                    successful merchant living at the turn of the century. It sat in a neighborhood
                    of grand houses, separated from the Alster by a road and then a strip of
                    parkland with chestnut trees bordering the lake. I collected the shiny dark nuts
                    from their green husks. When I saw it again, this house made me think of Thomas
                    Mann from nearby Lubeck, the Hanseatic capital, and his stories, shaded and
                    convoluted, of inward looking people. Our home had a wide terrace overlooking
                    the garden and Alster beyond, along whose watery edges I guided small branches,
                    pretending they were ships, and admired the sail boats on their tacks. I often
                    played alone there, and in the steep rock garden behind the house, using a boy's
                    powers of imagination to invent the stories of my world. I became self-reliant,
                    a good observer of my surroundings, and inclined to introspection rather than
                    extroversion.</p>
                <p>By the mid-1930s, the Nazi imprint defined Germany. Black, white, and red flags
                    with swastikas in the middle flew everywhere. Men in uniforms and civilians with
                    Nazi arm bands greeted each other with straight-armed “Heil Hitler!” salutes.
                    Martial music played at parades of goose-stepping soldiers, bonfire rallies were
                    held, and city-wide air raid drills with the sad, undulating wail of sirens were
                    commonplace. Adolf Hitler's shrill voice and Goebbels' propaganda filled the air
                    waves. Huge banners proclaimed “Ein Volk! Ein Reich! Ein Fuehrer!” All of this
                    was overwhelming and exciting to someone my age. I even glimpsed Hitler once as
                    he waved from the window of a train pulling into the Hamburg station. My parents
                    made it a point to tell me that what the Nazis were doing was wrong, and I took
                    this on faith. The German mother of a schoolmate found a different way to
                    explain Hitler. “In America you have President Roosevelt,” she told me, “in
                    Germany we have Hitler.” I knew about Roosevelt, so this made sense too.</p>
                <p>My classmates at the Bertram Schule, all boys, belonged to the Hitler Youth,
                    except for another American, Arthur Corwin whose father also worked for Socony,
                    and a Jewish boy named Wolfgang Lueders. On designated days, they wore their
                    brown short-pants uniforms. Our gym classes focused on military skills, among
                    them developing accuracy in throwing dummy wooden hand grenades of World War I
                    vintage. All of this in the first, second and third grades of Hamburg's last
                    liberal and private school.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>An outcast of sorts as well, I made it a point to befriend Wolfgang, who, as a
                    Jew, was bullied by our classmates. My parents talked about concentration camps
                    in cautious tones with a few of their German acquaintances, or with American
                    friends who would discuss this subject more openly. I recognized it as a
                    forbidden topic of some dark kind. There were rumors of a camp for Jews near
                    Hamburg which turned out to be a grim reality, we learned after the war. If
                    foreigners knew this, certainly Germans did. These experiences gave me a
                    life-long fascination with Germany. In the Foreign Service I was to live there
                    six more years. I learned the language, although the range of my vocabulary when
                    I had to speak German as an adult was confined to that of an eight-year-old, as
                    I would later discover to my frustration.</p>
                <p>Before Hitler invaded Poland my father was transferred to Holland, where I
                    attended the English School at The Hague. There, I learned more about the
                    oddities of the adult world. My best friend, Ben Chang, son of the Chinese
                    ambassador, told me one day his father had forbidden him to come to my home and
                    play with me. Ben could not explain why and felt as awkward about it as I. China
                    was in its own political turmoil. In school, I began to learn through textbooks
                    called Our Island's Story about a grand and imperial Britain of kings, castles,
                    and possessions all over the world on which, we were proudly told, the sun never
                    set. I also sensed there was a certain arrogance and racial prejudice on the
                    part of my classmates toward Ben.</p>
                <p>In 1940, we moved from The Hague to Madrid. My father enrolled me in the French
                    Lycee, where for a year I studied in another new language while picking up
                    street Spanish. Children do their best language learning on playgrounds during
                    recess: it is a matter of needing to know. Today, the shrieks and shouts of
                    children on a playground, most of them so absorbed in their games that nothing
                    else exists, make me smile as I pass a schoolyard and remember. Already
                    distinctions they do not understand are separating followers from leaders, the
                    awkward from the fleet, the shy from the bold. At the Lycee, a fellow ten-year
                    old, Miguel Simonetta, who spoke no English but—as an Italian in a French
                    school—understood my plight and helped me as much as he could to adjust to the
                    lycee's culture and classrooms. It was a frustrating time for me, especially in
                    our Spanish class which was taught in French.</p>
                <p>Spain, under Franco, had been torn apart by civil war. Many buildings,
                    particularly at Madrid's university, were in ruins and poverty was everywhere.
                    Walls all over Madrid were chipped by bullets, and I recreated scenes of street
                    fighting in my head with a sense of fright. I had never seen people beg before,
                    and was troubled by the women in black with their children in ragged clothing
                    who huddled with outstretched hands at the doors of restaurants and then stared
                    at us through the windows while we ate.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Being moved from country to country at an early age, and school to school,
                    creates a life that is often lonely. Lasting friendships are hard to make. Few
                    things are as intimidating as being the new boy or girl in class. Before
                    reaching college, I went to sixteen schools in three languages and benefited
                    from these experiences. The cultural isolation of young people abroad, when they
                    do not live with peers in American communities, can often lead to introspection
                    and feeling like an oddball. But it can also foster self-sufficiency and a way
                    of looking at the world more discriminatingly. We left Europe toward the summer
                    of 1940 in the Magallanes, the last transatlantic passenger ship to sail from
                    Vigo, in northern Spain, before the war made such crossings too dangerous. It
                    was our sixteenth voyage across the Atlantic, and I had acquired a love of the
                    ocean and ships. This time, we had a British destroyer escort for several days,
                    and our ship steamed under blackout conditions at night as a precaution against
                    submarine attack.</p>
                <p>It was generally a miserable trip during which one passenger died of food
                    poisoning, according to rumor and, to my fascination, was wrapped in canvas and
                    buried at sea. From then until we reached Havana, our first port of call, my
                    mother put us on a basic boiled potato diet, figuring potatoes couldn't be
                    spoiled. We ate like kings in Havana, and the ship was reprovisioned for a more
                    pleasant journey to New York's great harbor. There was a thrill like no other in
                    reaching Ambrose light ship off Coney Island, and then sliding past the Statue
                    of Liberty on the port hand into a berth near the heart of Manhattan, with
                    majestic ships lining the other piers and whistles tooting on Moran's tugs. Such
                    images from my youth may have influenced my decision, when the time came in
                    another war, to join the Navy.</p>
                <p>When we sailed from the continent, I knew, even as a ten-year-old, that the
                    Germans, among whom I had lived in Hamburg, had invaded my mother's native
                    Poland and the Dutch feared they would be next. I could not help noticing the
                    many uniformed Nazis strolling in the halls of the Palace Hotel in Madrid, where
                    we stayed. The pageantry of the Nazis, as I had innocently experienced it in
                    Hamburg, had turned into something evil and threatening I felt intimidated by,
                    and whose implications I could not yet understand.</p>
                <p>We returned to post-war Germany for a short while in 1946. In Hamburg I found a
                    city I had known nearly devastated. The Bertram Schule became a Red Cross office
                    after the war. I found my former headmaster, Claus Bertram, to whom I brought
                    coffee, sugar, flour, cigarettes and other luxuries. There was emotion in old
                    Herr Bertram's thanks and, at 16, I felt awkward about the reversal of roles
                    between us.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Living and traveling in different parts of Europe—we had visited England, France,
                    Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary before the war—gave me a more informed
                    appreciation of the United States. I learned to view Americans in contrast to
                    other people, and became aware of differences that provided insights in both
                    directions. My country seemed the most powerful on earth, a good place, and my
                    real home. Abroad, the dollar got you anything, and I was impressed. Having
                    “greenbacks,” as my father called them, was better than pesetas or zlotys; he
                    proudly gave his tips in dollar bills when we traveled. But there was something
                    about Europe's long complex history that tugged at me—Carcassonne's castle from
                    the Roman period in Southern France, and city buildings centuries old that had
                    seen other days and people wearing different clothes, a flow of time and
                    cultures my parents wanted me to appreciate. One hot summer's day in 1936, my
                    father took me hiking near Carcassonne, he with his geologist's hammer chipping
                    away at prehistoric rocks, when suddenly on a hilltop we stumbled on several
                    overgrown and crumbled ancient walls and foundations—one of the discovery
                    thrills of my life because he, too, was excited.</p>
                <p>The stimulation of thinking in these terms helped shape my interest in a foreign
                    service career during which I could expect to see much more of the world. It was
                    a deepening of my understanding of the United States acquired beyond our shores,
                    combined with an appreciation of America's burgeoning influence throughout the
                    world, and a love of living as an American overseas, that began to nudge me
                    toward a diplomatic career.</p>
                <p>C Wartime Washington</p>
                <p>By the spring of 1942, Washington, DC, until recently a sleepy city with a low
                    skyline in the north of the South that had two legitimate theaters (and the
                    “Gayety” burlesque house) and about the same number of good restaurants, became
                    the bureaucratic and strategic center for a two-front war. National Airport had
                    just opened. The Pentagon was being built, and wooden World War I barracks on
                    the mall were converted to offices where people like my father, borrowed for
                    government service from corporate life, had switched over to wartime-related
                    jobs.</p>
                <p>Racial segregation was pervasive, and even someone as young as I realized that
                    “Negroes” were more oppressed here than in the north. There was little air
                    conditioning outside the movie theaters. A wholly new feeling, after the
                    Depression years, of excitement and commitment to a national purpose had been
                    created by Franklin Roosevelt. My father, a lifelong Democrat and patriotic,
                    loved being part of this effort. He was too young for the first world war, and
                    his war had finally come. My mother felt the passions about America of a
                    first-generation immigrant, and her Polish blood boiled at the Nazi invasion of
                    her homeland. At the movies, where the national anthem was always sung when the
                    lights had dimmed, her voice was louder than the rest, which disconcerted me and
                    my father.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Housing for people like us, who poured in from every part of the country, became
                    unavailable. After living for weeks downtown at the Annapolis Hotel by the bus
                    terminal, and then in a rented house in far-out Takoma Park, my parents finally
                    found a small two bedroom apartment in McLean Gardens, which had been built to
                    meet the housing crisis. From there, I rode the Wisconsin Avenue streetcar a few
                    stops to Alice Deal Junior High and later Woodrow Wilson High School.</p>
                <p>The heroes of that time were our men and women in uniform. The whole country was
                    proud of them. Homes had small white banners with blue stars in the front
                    windows to proclaim sons and daughters in military service. All too soon, these
                    blue stars began to change to gold, signifying loss. National pride in military
                    service would regrettably diminish during the Korean and Vietnam wars later on.
                    Some kinds of food, like meat, butter, canned goods, and all gasoline, were
                    rationed. We put blackout shades in our windows so Washington would be difficult
                    for enemy bombers to find. There was much snooping to see who was letting cracks
                    of light shine through. My father volunteered to be an air raid warden and was
                    issued a white helmet, flashlight, arm band and whistle. During infrequent air
                    raid drills, he and his companions would be in the streets checking blackout
                    procedures.</p>
                <p>At Woodrow Wilson High I did my part by joining the cadet corps. We were
                    instructed in close order drill by a retired army officer, and marched around
                    the neighborhood with World War I rifles when we weren't using wooden ones.
                    Cadets were proud of their blue uniforms, which they wore twice a week to class
                    for drill afterwards. Even we thought it odd, however, that the regulation white
                    shirts called for detachable collars, and garters were prescribed to hold up our
                    socks. We loved going to the huge military displays on the mall around the
                    Washington monument called “Back the Attack.” These were supported by Hollywood
                    bands and movie stars to sell war bonds and build morale. By high school
                    graduation in June of 1945, all of us who were young men felt certain we would
                    soon be fighting “the Japs” on remote Pacific islands. The honored guest at our
                    wartime graduation was Mrs. (Edith Bolling) Woodrow Wilson, the elderly widow of
                    the president.</p>
                <p>It was an inspiring and terrible time. Franklin Roosevelt died on April 12. The
                    nation had probably not experienced a similar feeling of loss since Lincoln's
                    assassination. My parents wept. The relatively unknown Truman, with his owlish
                    look, bow ties and clipped speech, had become president, and few foresaw his
                    greatness. Hitler committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on April 30. The Allies
                    proclaimed V-E Day in Europe on May 8. Atomic bombs, incomprehensibly hellish
                    weapons few knew about or understood, were dropped on Japan on August 6 and 9. I
                    was later to serve at our embassy in New Delhi with Colonel Paul W. Tibbets,
                    Jr., pilot of the Enola Gay, which released the bomb on Hiroshima. A pleasant
                    man, he regarded this mission as part of his military duties. The Japanese
                    formally surrendered on September 2. The war was over and America had won in a
                    triumph of good over evil; the part played by our allies got pushed to the
                    background in national euphoria. The draft, too, was over.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>D. Fordham, Bard, and Princeton</p>
                <p>My father returned to Socony-Vacuum's headquarters at Bowling Green in New York
                    City for nearly a year, and I tried to get into college. This turned out to be
                    difficult, as I was then only a few weeks past sixteen. The GI Bill was
                    providing veterans subsidized education. Universities, whose student populations
                    had shrunk and been heavily female during the war, suddenly found their
                    admissions offices swamped by applications from GIs in their mid- and late
                    twenties. Turned down by Columbia and other places, I was finally accepted at
                    Fordham University in the Bronx. With only two years of high school Latin and no
                    Greek, I was obliged to become a science major and chose physics. Living on
                    campus in the soulless Dealy Hall, I came to resist the rigid discipline and
                    narrow, arid outlook of the Jesuits as I then perceived them. My devout mother
                    had raised me to be a Roman Catholic. My perception of human existence, however,
                    was closer to Nabokov's image of the brief crack of light, as was my father's.
                    Life at Fordham convinced me that Roman Catholicism was not a faith I could
                    embrace. Nor was I cut out for physics.</p>
                <p>I took what would have been my sophomore year off, and moved with my family to
                    Vienna, a capital much damaged by war. My father was at first an “assimilated”
                    colonel, with an army uniform and distinctly unmilitary salute. He then became
                    petroleum attach� at our legation in the Boltzmanngasse, with the task of
                    recovering the Zistersdorf refineries from the Soviets in whose zone of
                    occupation they were located. Once again, he had been seconded to government
                    service. In Vienna, as earlier in Hamburg, I saw how war could destroy buildings
                    and lives. The winter of 1946-47 in Europe was one of the coldest on record and
                    the Viennese suffered bitterly as coal supplies ran out. We lived in a big,
                    sparsely furnished villa at Blaas Strasse 15 that had been requisitioned by US
                    forces. Its former occupant had been the Hitler Youth leader for Austria.</p>
                <p>I soon learned about four-power occupation responsibilities, PXs, black markets,
                    prostitutes for the military, cigarettes as currency, joint Allied patrols in
                    Jeeps, and the significance of sectors of a city and zones of a country. Even
                    with good intentions, occupiers take on a certain arrogance through their
                    unlimited powers and contrasting life styles. We youngsters happily danced at
                    the “American” Bristol Hotel while the Viennese froze and scrambled for food and
                    coal. It was also my first encounter with Soviet forces, and they were an
                    ill-kempt, brutish, and ignorant lot. The Viennese called them “Uhr Raueber,” or
                    “watch thieves.”</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I became involved in the city's musical life, going to unheated concert and opera
                    halls in overcoat and boots. This was when I first heard the young Polish
                    pianist Andrzej Wasowski, already a brilliant interpreter of Chopin. I would
                    later help smuggle him out of Austria by train in a high-risk bribing of Soviet
                    border guards with American cigarettes. He became a lifelong friend. What I
                    couldn't know then was that this experience in Vienna would serve as an
                    introduction to two foreign service tours in occupied Berlin under similar
                    military arrangements, but in an entirely different legal and psychological
                    environment. Berliners wanted us to stay. Austrians reluctantly tolerated
                    us.</p>
                <p>In the fall of 1947, at the suggestion of my boyhood friend Samuel Allen, I
                    continued my studies at Bard, a small “progressive” college in New York's Hudson
                    Valley that was putting John Dewey's philosophy of education into practice. Sam
                    and I first got together in the fifth grade at The Brookside School in
                    Montclair, New Jersey. A country day school, its low buildings were in a
                    woodland setting where you could carry lunch trays from the cafeteria under the
                    trees. We were soulmates, deciding to become archeologists and go on digs in
                    Egypt. We spent many hours poring over Carter and Mace's account of the
                    discovery of the tomb of Tut-Ankh-Amen in 1922, in the Valley of the Kings. When
                    I moved away, we wrote to each other regularly about what we saw and thought.
                    From Sam I would learn much about the excitement and controversy of contemporary
                    art, as well as classical music and jazz when, as roommates at Bard in the late
                    forties, we explored the galleries on 57th Street in New York, went to concerts
                    at Carnegie Hall, and discovered gin and the Dixieland bands of Greenwich
                    Village. When Sam died suddenly in 1997, I saw how much of what we had known
                    about each other and our times, through nearly sixty years, left with him.</p>
                <p>At Bard, I came to appreciate what it meant to be in college in the immediate
                    post-war years. The average age of male students was five or six years above my
                    own, and they were for the most part people who knew about combat, death, drink,
                    women, partying and getting serious about studies and life. They worked hard and
                    played hard. College was a rich and full life, largely free of the usual
                    sophomoric capers, though not without great fun.</p>
                <p>To younger students like myself, the veterans were respected teachers, mentors
                    and friends of great value. Girls adapted quickly and expected their dates to
                    act maturely. Greenhorns like me, who had been high school cadets with wooden
                    rifles, had a lot of growing up to do. Veterans enriched the tone of campus life
                    and deepened seminar discussions by providing their experiences of the outside
                    world. Their impact on academia in the late '40s and early '50s was pervasive
                    and lasting. I am grateful for having experienced college and graduate school in
                    their company. Robert MacAlister, later a government colleague in AID, is a
                    friend from that generation.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I was very happy at Bard. No part of America has stronger pull on my love of
                    countryside or sense of place than Duchess County, in New York. The areas around
                    Red Hook and Rhinebeck are beginning to change with urban sprawl, but I still
                    find the open spaces, apple orchards and woods, the white frame homes and barns,
                    and the banks of the Hudson River at Barrytown much as they were at mid-century.
                    For me, there is nowhere a more wondrous sense of the moods, colors, smells and
                    wetness of changing seasons than at Bard.</p>
                <p>Through Joan Williams, a talented friend majoring in creative writing, I came to
                    know the southern novelist William Faulkner. Joan has written about these times
                    in her novel, “The Wintering.” We saw him at Bard in the summer, and in New
                    York, often meeting him somewhere in the Village. When I visited Joan in Memphis
                    in 1950, we spent a day in Oxford, Mississippi at Faulkner's home, Rowan Oak,
                    and then on his houseboat at Sardis Dam with his wife Estelle. He was short and
                    muscular, calm and introverted; a soft-spoken man with a southerner's gray
                    moustache, nattily dressed, courtly and kind, always ready for one of life's
                    ironies to manifest itself so he could comment on it. He liked to drink, puff on
                    his pipe, tell stories, laugh his quiet chuckle and talk about the South. He
                    also valued the silences in conversation and had a moodiness about him. Faulkner
                    seemed weighed down by some huge and melancholy burden. When I asked him to
                    inscribe a reprint of his first novel, “Soldiers Pay,” he thought for a moment
                    and wrote: “To Brandon Grove with tenderest regards. William Faulkner at Joan
                    Williams' 16 May 1953.” I liked him immensely, even while he, too, was falling
                    in love with Joan.</p>
                <p>I've often thought it was at Bard that I learned to think. From inspired teachers
                    like Felix Hirsch in history, Louis Koenig in government, Fred Crane in American
                    political thought, Adolf Sturmthal in economics, and Lincoln Reis in philosophy,
                    I learned that knowledge, to be used wisely, requires discipline and depth as
                    well as integration into one's own scheme of things.</p>
                <p>My senior project was titled Foreign Policy Coordination in the Executive Branch
                    of the U.S. Government, and foreshadowed my foreign service career. It drew upon
                    two six-week winter internships at the State Department as well as interviews
                    conducted in Washington during 1949-50, and focused on the evolution of the
                    Marshall Plan. I read it again at Bard a few years ago and found problems of
                    policy coordination one recognizes today.</p>
                <p>These two internships in Washington brought me back to a city I had not seen
                    since the end of the war. Harry Truman presided over an America that had come to
                    accept big government. In national security affairs, a unifying Department of
                    Defense, separate air force, and joint chiefs of staff were created in 1947, as
                    were the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Council. We had
                    switched our enemies from the Germans and Japanese to the Russians, and were
                    preparing for a long Cold War. Some of the prewar provincialism of Washington
                    was gone for good, but the city had not yet experienced the eruption of law
                    firms, lobbyists, pressure groups, corporate offices, non-governmental
                    organizations, think tanks and centers of culture that would cause such rapid
                    expansion from the 1960s onward. It was stimulating to be there for this turn in
                    the city's always measured pace of life and its main industry, government.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>When I first entered the State Department on 21st Street (it was housed in the
                    Executive Office Building, along with the War Department before 1943) I will
                    admit to being thrilled. From these offices—I tended to overlook their rundown,
                    cramped and shabby state—the most powerful nation in the world was in touch with
                    its diplomatic posts across the globe. Decisions made here were affecting the
                    future of mankind. Secretary of State Dean Acheson had great and photogenic
                    panache, with his well-cut suits, British moustache, and aloofness: an ideal
                    diplomat for these Eurocentric times. This almost patrician man from Groton was
                    an intimate adviser and friend of that most plebeian and worthy president from
                    Missouri, and for many years was a powerful voice in congress, having once been
                    in charge of the State Department's congressional relations.</p>
                <p>On learning one morning that Acheson would be holding a press conference in the
                    small second floor auditorium, I decided to attend and had no trouble joining
                    twenty or so polite and respectful members of the press. Security in the State
                    Department was practically non-existent. Acheson, perched on the corner of a
                    table with one foot on the floor and his hands clasped in his lap, held forth
                    with precision and eloquence. Little did I then understand the inhibiting
                    domestic and foreign pressures, the often nasty personal and bureaucratic
                    politics, that in the day-to-day struggles of Washington shape what is possible
                    in our foreign relations.</p>
                <p>Herewith, an architectural footnote to these internships in Washington. At the
                    time, what today is the main State Department building at 22nd and C Streets was
                    being constructed as a vast addition to “Old State,” now serving as AID's
                    headquarters. By the late forties, America's leaders recognized that the Soviet
                    threat must be countered, in the first instance, through diplomacy. The
                    alternative to failed diplomacy would be war. Implementing, for the first time,
                    a diplomatic strategy that would be global in its concept and
                    underpinnings—something quite new for a no longer isolationist US—required more
                    people and space. Before the war, there were less than 1,000 employees at the
                    State Department; after the war the number increased to over 7,000.</p>
                <p>An architect's design speaks to a building's functions and the aesthetic reach of
                    the times. “New State” is what Mussolini might have sketched on a rainy day: a
                    lump of concrete ponderously and oppressively bureaucratic in appearance, devoid
                    of imagination, dignity, lift or elegance, and barely functional. What a
                    tragically missed opportunity! Tens of thousands of people have spent their
                    working lives at the State Department, hating that monstrosity which is so
                    unrepresentative of our country's character and power, and our worthy intentions
                    (at least most of the time) abroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>As the end of undergraduate days at Bard approached, I faced a decision about my
                    future: to become a lawyer or diplomat? Both professions require negotiating
                    skills, powers of persuasion and disciplined minds, and both value precedents
                    and the binding nature of agreements. But there are differences in the
                    leadership, management, and policy implementation skills necessary to diplomacy,
                    and in the public nature of then poorly paid government service, not to mention
                    the challenges to oneself and family in living abroad. I was president of my
                    graduating class and a John Bard Scholar. The world ahead seemed at peace and
                    prosperous at home, but increasingly complicated, perilous, and uncertain
                    abroad. What kind of life did I want to have?</p>
                <p>Childhood years in Europe, schooling in German and French, an interest in new
                    forms of diplomacy such as the Marshall Plan and the evolving policy-making
                    structure in Washington, made government service, for me, a natural choice.
                    There were other pulls as well, not least a love of travel to exotic places
                    sparked by Richard Haliburton, whose books of adventurous derring-do I devoured
                    as a boy, and an earlier ambition, inspired by my father's interests, to
                    understand ancient history and become an archeologist in Egypt with my boyhood
                    chum Sam Allen.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate in being accepted into the recently established graduate program
                    of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton,
                    temporarily accommodated in a building once occupied by one of the eating clubs
                    on Prospect Street. Twenty-six students were admitted annually, half of them
                    from abroad. The international financier and philanthropist Alecko Papamarkou
                    was among these, and became a lifelong friend. It was to be the third school I
                    attended named after that internationalist of moral outlook, Woodrow Wilson, who
                    had also been president of Princeton.</p>
                <p>On graduation day at Bard early in June of 1950, and looking toward the Foreign
                    Service, I never doubted the US would play a preeminent role in the post-war
                    world. On June 25, however, some three weeks after our graduation, North Korean
                    troops crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea, launching the Korean War.
                    Because I had been admitted to graduate school before the outbreak of war, I was
                    allowed to continue my studies under draft deferments. Once again, however,
                    military service became a likely prospect.</p>
                <p>Princeton's campus dominated the small, bucolic town surrounding it. Grey-haired
                    stonemasons from Italy—theirs was a dying craft—were putting the finishing
                    touches on the new Firestone Library. Academically, I found many of the required
                    readings in government and international relations too theoretical, and a
                    faddish emphasis on quantification in the social sciences frustrating to grasp
                    and sometimes hard to take seriously. My tastes ran to Professor Gabriel
                    Almond's pioneering case studies in the foreign policy-making process, my own
                    topic being US recognition of Israel in 1948. My grades were
                    undistinguished.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>During part of the summer of 1950, working in the new library, I cataloged the
                    personal papers of James V. Forrestal, our first secretary of defense. He had
                    become obsessed by Soviet power, which he felt Truman's administration was
                    underrating, and committed suicide a year earlier by jumping from a pantry
                    window at Bethesda Naval Hospital. He left his private papers to Princeton. It
                    was an engrossing education for me in the politics of how Washington works, as
                    revealed in his notes, correspondence and memoranda, and the effects of stress
                    on public officials and their marriages during the Cold War.</p>
                <p>In 1951, my father became president of Mobil Oil of Egypt, and I spent that
                    summer in Cairo, one of the most engrossing cities in the world. There was a
                    softness in the night air along the Nile, with its scent of jasmine. A young,
                    corrupt and immensely fat King Farouk was still in power and Cairo was a city of
                    social tensions below the surface. Farouk was the prototype playboy. It was the
                    old and tottering Egypt of Shepherd's Hotel—as glamorous as it has been made out
                    to be—and that relic of a British colonial past, the Gezira Sporting Club in
                    Az-Zamalik. In those days the pyramids sat alone in the desert, well beyond the
                    city limits of Cairo. My father, who loved both Egypt and archeology, insisted I
                    see them for the first time at night, in moonlight.</p>
                <p>My father had the reputation in the international oil business of being one of
                    the thoughtful people on the Middle East, someone with a conceptual framework
                    for the region who understood cultures and players on all sides, listened
                    carefully, and came to his own assessments about what was going on and what this
                    meant for Mobil. His range of friends and acquaintances was wide, particularly
                    in Arab and Iranian circles and among journalists. His close ties to oil expert
                    Walter J. Levy and journalist Wanda Jablonski lasted a lifetime. His knowledge,
                    candor, and unpretentious ways made him someone people liked to talk to. At the
                    same time he knew, beyond archeology, geology and history, the best restaurants
                    and wines in London, Paris and New York, and the pleasures of entertaining well.
                    He and I were always close.</p>
                <p>I thought the public debate in the US about recognizing Israel was largely
                    one-sided, and therefore wrote my summer paper for Princeton on Dimensions of
                    the Arab Case to articulate a more balanced view of the issues and their likely
                    consequences. I wrote in 1951, three years after Israel's birth, “The
                    Arab-Jewish conflict was by no means resolved in the armistice agreements of
                    February, 1949...I find that I sympathize with many aspects of the Arab
                    argument, and I recognize their predicament as a difficult one. While Arabs have
                    suffered in the past as a result of the Jewish state, there is no need today for
                    them to continue to suffer as they do now. The essential step for Arabs is to
                    accept Israel, with conditions about immigration and refugees, if advisable, but
                    to accept the state as a fait accompli, and to begin to work out a way of life
                    with her.”</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Through my father's intervention with friends in the Egyptian military, I was
                    able to ride in a motor convoy to Gaza, then a vast UN refugee camp under
                    Egyptian control. I vowed to visit Israel and more of the Middle East. While
                    stationed in Jerusalem as consul general from 1980-83, I remembered that world
                    of thirty years earlier and marveled at how long it had taken to achieve a peace
                    agreement between Egypt and Israel, as Sadat and Begin had finally been able to
                    do in 1979. After receiving my master's degree in public affairs in 1952, I
                    decided to focus on the Middle East and work toward a Ph.D. in the Politics
                    department. As always, my father, who had worked hard for his own graduate
                    education and deeply believed in the value of books and learning, supported
                    me.</p>
                <p>Princeton's imposing graduate college was modeled on the colleges in Cambridge
                    and, under the influence of the university's president Woodrow Wilson, aped in a
                    rather pointless way some of the high table traditions of that ancient English
                    university. Undergraduates called it “goon castle.” In my third year I was
                    elected Master in Residence, regularly spoke an evening grace in Latin wearing a
                    black and flowing academic gown, as did everyone else at dinner, and lived in an
                    oak-paneled Master's Suite two floors high with its own library, huge stone
                    fireplace, spiral stairs, and a striking view from the balcony of the golf
                    course it overlooked. To welcome speakers joining us for dinner, I served sherry
                    by the fire for a small group of students in the visitor's field of interest.
                    This was a distraction from more serious work I shamelessly enjoyed.</p>
                <p>A revolt against black gowns fueled by radical elements among the engineering and
                    math majors erupted in the fall of 1953, and a great, scheduled debate took
                    place after dinner one evening which was appropriately reported in The New
                    Yorker magazine. I presided over this session, during which people wearing
                    parodies of gowns and face paint climbed in and out the windows from the golf
                    course. When it came to voting, the more tradition-minded “gownies” won handily,
                    to the relief of the graduate school's apprehensive dean. My roommate in the
                    Master's Suite was Norval Crawford White, who was to become an architect and
                    write guide books about the streets and buildings of New York. From him and his
                    extroverted and party-loving friends, I gained an appreciation of architectural
                    design and admiration for architects. This predisposition would serve me well 35
                    years afterwards, as I worked on the design of the Arlington Hall campus for the
                    Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>Professor Alpheus T. Mason, a constitutional scholar of note, taught an
                    undergraduate course in American Political Thought and asked me to become one of
                    his preceptors, or seminar leaders. This I did with enthusiasm while my interest
                    in further studies flagged and I failed a course in political theory. I
                    abandoned thoughts of a Ph.D. and took the train to Philadelphia one fall day in
                    1953 to enlist at the Navy's recruiting office on 13 South 13th Street, an
                    address I was certain would be propitious, for a spring class of training at the
                    Officer Candidates' School in Newport, Rhode Island. My eligibility for draft
                    deferment was running out, and I loved the sea I had come to know in
                    transatlantic crossings with my parents.</p>
                <p>E Military Service in the US Navy</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>A truce in the Korean War was signed at Panmunjom in July of 1953, and as a
                    result I was not engaged in combat during my three and a half years in the Navy.
                    For me, military service was a learning experience at several levels. In three
                    years of living aboard ships in the Caribbean and Pacific, I came to understand
                    how the military functions and admired much of what I saw. I also began to find
                    my way around in a new part of the world, East Asia.</p>
                <p>Officer candidate training was even more difficult than I had expected. Gunnery
                    and engineering competence came with great effort, and my grades deteriorated.
                    Only when my urine turned dark did I realize there was something wrong with me.
                    I had hepatitis, and was hospitalized for six weeks. This, in turn, moved me
                    into the following class of candidates. I remembered the answers to many of the
                    quizzes and sailed through. I was made commander of Company A, and we were
                    eventually considered a sharp looking bunch.</p>
                <p>My tour of duty was in the amphibious force, widely and accurately regarded as
                    the grimy, greasy workhorse of the fighting Navy. None of the glamour of
                    destroyer, or “tin can” duty here, but I was not disappointed. My first ship was
                    the USS CAMBRIA (APA-36) out of Norfolk, Virginia, a port known to sailors as
                    “Shit City” for its inhospitable treatment of men in uniform, except when it
                    came to separating them from their pay. In barely less than a decade after World
                    War II, public regard for the uniform had declined there and elsewhere in the
                    US.</p>
                <p>The Korean War, or UN police action as it was also termed, enjoyed little of the
                    popular appeal or support of World War II. Its objectives within a global Cold
                    War were hard to explain. The enemy became more difficult to define for
                    Americans comfortable with clear-cut understandings of “us” and “them.” Yet
                    there were nearly 34,000 battle deaths in this seminal Cold War struggle that
                    for the first time placed the West in military opposition to communist
                    expansion. During its course, President Truman fired the American conservatives'
                    hero, General Douglas MacArthur, for insubordination. That was another defining
                    act, and a high point in his presidency.</p>
                <p>The CAMBRIA was a large troop transport capable of carrying a Marine battalion
                    and then discharging it onto a beach from its shoe box shaped landing craft, the
                    LCMs and smaller LCVPs which were nested on board. My duties were those of a
                    deck officer and supporting officer in the boat group. I became a junior watch
                    officer on the bridge, and learned how a ship moves through the waters and
                    handles in maneuvers.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>During amphibious operations, cargo nets were draped over the ship's sides, and
                    we scrambled up and down with our gear to get into, or leave, the boats bobbing
                    below. The nets swayed from the ship's sides in wide arcs as it rolled with the
                    waves. One moment you were hanging out over open sea, and the next colliding
                    with the ship's side on the counter-roll. The trick was to let go with the boat
                    safely underneath. It was a harrowing experience every time. Some Marines became
                    sea sick even before they reached the boats; nearly all others got sick in the
                    boats, and it is in this condition that we delivered them on the beach.</p>
                <p>The CAMBRIA was what the Navy calls a “rust bucket,” an aging yet oddly dignified
                    survivor of amphibious landings in the Mediterranean during World War II. She
                    was in disrepair, rat infested, and behind in technology, all due to lack of
                    adequate funds in post-war years to maintain our two-ocean fleet. I still liked
                    her, and found the hours of watch-standing while underway one of life's unsung
                    pleasures, especially during the first watch as the sun slowly comes up and ends
                    the night while the crew still sleeps. The sense of responsibility during night
                    watches, when only you and a few watch-standers on the bridge and in the engine
                    room are on duty, is something you feel right into your bones. It made me think
                    of Joseph Conrad's books about the sea.</p>
                <p>Our wardroom mess in the CAMBRIA had a president, and a mess caterer whose duties
                    were to plan meals with the chief cook and then listen to stupid suggestions and
                    complaints from the officers. Our mess president was the chief engineer, a
                    small, wiry, completely humorless man named Lichtenberger. Lieutenant Commander
                    Lichtenberger seemed to do little else than play bridge, and was widely, and in
                    my view understandably, believed to hate going down to the engine rooms. Mess
                    catering duties rotated among officers in order to spread the blame, and one day
                    Lichtenberger told me it was my turn. After a few days on the job, and having
                    reviewed the Navy's printed and numbered recipes, I decided to improve the whole
                    concept of our fare. We were in the Caribbean—and it was hot. Every meal had
                    been greasy and heavy. One fateful lunch, I served cold cream of potato soup
                    (having a vichyssoise in mind), cheese souffle with a tossed green salad, and a
                    nice, light dessert. I heard several officers muttering “Jesus!” while poking at
                    their food. “Is this all there is?” Lichtenberger snarled at me. “Yes, sir” I
                    replied. “Grove,” he said, “you're FIRED!”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>We steamed in the Caribbean on amphibious landing exercises, calling several
                    times at Havana, then a wide-open city. We also spent a memorable weekend in
                    Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I served as Senior Shore Patrol Officer those three days,
                    designated by the ominously Russian-sounding acronym SENSHOPATOFF, and can
                    unflinchingly state that I had reason, in the course of my duties, to stroll
                    through virtually every bar and brothel in that colorful, sinful town.The Navy
                    believed such display of authority would have a calming effect on patrons from
                    our ship. In practice I did not find this to be the case, although I am six feet
                    five and must have made quite an entrance, with my rugged team, in shore patrol
                    regalia. I recounted all of this in a lively way to our politically appointed
                    and very proper ambassador to Haiti some 24 years later, when I was his house
                    guest while serving as deputy assistant secretary of state for the Caribbean. To
                    my disappointment, he wasn't amused.</p>
                <p>Few ways of living contrast more sharply than a sedate and bookish life in the
                    master's suite at Princeton, birds chirping on the golf course, and the endless
                    days and nights spent in rough and greasy work aboard the CAMBRIA, where the
                    bosun's pipe and whining deck winches were constant sounds. In the Navy,
                    however, I learned a lot about what people are like and how they can be
                    organized and motivated, as well as about morale, discipline and leadership.
                    There is no better school for acquiring such knowledge than standing anchor
                    watch in the bow of a ship as it enters port on a cold day. And I mean cold:
                    C-O-L-D. Regardless of differences in rank, education or race, men become equal
                    in their need to huddle together against the wind. Connected to the bridge by a
                    set of headphones one of the sailors is wearing, we clutch our coffee mugs and
                    begin to talk.</p>
                <p>Here I have heard, in the language of sailors, funny, wise, and sometimes sad
                    tales of life, the sexual feats coarsely exaggerated, but not an understated
                    pain and loneliness that often came through. Many of these men grew up in broken
                    families in a tough, deprived, and sometimes dangerous world, with racial
                    discrimination central to their young lives. For some, their own new families
                    were beginning to come apart, not helped by their lives at sea. A command comes
                    from the bridge, the chain lock is knocked open in one swing, and anchor and
                    chain splash down to a muddy bottom with a great rumbling felt through the ship.
                    On common impulse, the group becomes distant and breaks up. The wind subsides
                    and hierarchy is back in place.</p>
                <p>Our military services have led the nation in racial desegregation, if at first
                    reluctantly. By the mid-fifties, when I served at sea, black officers and petty
                    officers were increasingly common and usually accepted without tension. Yet the
                    process was slow. Prejudice was felt by Filipinos and Hispanics, the former
                    constituting the cadre of stewards and much of the galley crew, the latter
                    usually assigned to the meanest work on deck and in the engine rooms. Training
                    programs in literacy and job skills were changing that. An environment of
                    egalitarian practices throughout the military, and the specific policies that
                    encourage it, rank among the important though belated social accomplishments of
                    our nation.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Efforts to secure a transfer to the West Coast after a year and a half in the
                    CAMBRIA bore fruit. My motives were selfish; I had never been west of Oklahoma
                    City, and wanted to see our country and the world beyond. I drove to San Diego
                    in the early summer of 1957, making my way alone for two weeks on the smaller
                    and cooler northern roads of our land, and became fascinated by the countryside
                    and immensity of the American West, its spaces, scenery, history and the
                    openness of its people. I liked the little town of Medora, North Dakota, so much
                    I spent two days there.</p>
                <p>Tied up at the pier in San Diego, the USS TULARE (AKA-112) was a newly
                    commissioned amphibious cargo ship of 18,000 tons and a length of 564 feet. She
                    could steam in excess of 22 knots and was, in many ways, the opposite of my
                    former ship. Living spaces were large and clean, and her equipment was up to
                    date. She was more difficult to handle, however, with her two large cargo masts
                    blocking the view from the bridge. I reported on board as a lieutenant (junior
                    grade), a qualified officer of the deck, and the new boat group commander.</p>
                <p>We soon were deployed, in that summer of 1957, for nine months in the Western
                    Pacific to be based in Yokosuka, Japan, outside Tokyo. The war had been over for
                    twelve years, and had left its mark in the modernization and partial
                    westernization of Japan, but above all in Japan's evident progress toward
                    democracy. Here, as I had seen in post-war Germany and Austria, Americans had
                    been the occupiers. This time I was in uniform, always treated courteously but
                    never with warmth. Given Japanese social customs and the nature of our military
                    presence there, this was hardly astonishing. Memories of atomic bombs were very
                    much alive, as I recognized painfully during our ship's visit to Hiroshima.</p>
                <p>I did my utmost to see as much of Japan as possible, usually traveling by train
                    and sleeping on the floor at inns. The country and its people grew on me, and to
                    this day I feel attracted to Japan. The Ueno in Tokyo is one of my favorite
                    museums. I began collecting Hanga wood prints, forceful art often subtly
                    influenced, as with Onchi and Azechi, by the French moderns. Cross-cultural
                    influences among artists again impressed me when I later experienced the power
                    of West African wood carvings and understood how, earlier in this century, they
                    had affected Picasso's work and that of his contemporaries.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>We were at sea for much of the time, visiting such ports as Hong Kong, then a
                    sleepy place with a colonial ambiance and no high-rise buildings, where the
                    fabled Correspondents Club overlooked the bay. And Singapore, in whose long bar
                    at the original Raffles Hotel I grandly ordered a Singapore Sling, a concoction
                    whose appeal does not threaten more traditional cocktails such as a martini. We
                    also called at Guam, Okinawa and Manila. We spent a week in Sydney where
                    Americans, having saved Australia from the Japanese while most of its men were
                    away fighting the Germans and Italians, were still treated as heroes. The
                    welcome was overwhelming. Men in uniform rode free on public transportation and
                    the drinks were usually on the Aussies. As a people they reminded me of what we
                    Americans must once have been: open, optimistic, a bit naive, and energetically
                    ambitious. Sydney was the ultimate liberty port after weeks at sea, believe
                    me.</p>
                <p>We trained in large and small landing exercises, one of them held on South
                    Korea's shores. As commander of our boat group, I learned how the Navy plans its
                    operations down to the smallest details. I briefed officers and crew on the
                    intricacies of scheduled landings, and learned the value of speaking clearly,
                    briefly, and to the point. Without constant teamwork nothing would succeed, and
                    teamwork required an exact understanding of objectives and coordinated
                    leadership at every level to achieve them. Operation BEACON HILL on the
                    Philippine island of Luzon, in which we participated, was the biggest amphibious
                    landing in the Pacific since World War II, involving over one hundred ships and
                    tens of thousands of sailors and Marines. I had never seen anything so vast. On
                    leaving the Western Pacific, our ship received the fleet's award of excellence
                    for the performance of my boat group. We proudly painted the white crossed
                    anchors of the Assault Boat Insignia on the sides of our bridge.</p>
                <p>In San Diego once again, I was nearing the end of my required military service. I
                    had resolved the issue of whether to study law or prepare for the Foreign
                    Service in deciding to attend the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton. Service in
                    the Navy and nine months in the seaports of the Pacific strengthened this
                    decision. After boning up on US history, current events and economics, having
                    been away from studies for four years, I drove one fall day in 1958 to Los
                    Angeles and took the written part of the Foreign Service exam. With the help of
                    a 5-point veterans' bonus, I passed. Mustered out of the Navy, I decided to
                    drive back to Washington during two weeks along a southerly route, just as I had
                    headed north on my way to the West coast to avoid hot weather. In our southwest,
                    as in Texas and New Orleans, I saw a different and appealing side of America
                    that was completely new to me. In 1958, there was a lot of open country left,
                    and I enjoyed the food, music and buildings that spoke of our Creole, Spanish
                    and Mexican heritage.</p>
                <p>Finally, I thought, my career in the Foreign Service was about to begin.</p>
                <p>F Waiting to Begin: The USSR and Chester Bowles</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>It was not to be. I had to wait for more than a year to enter because the list of
                    accepted candidates was long. This was after the McCarthy hearings, when
                    security clearances were drawn-out and backlogged. The State Department had
                    undergone a reduction-in-force and the intake of junior officers was limited,
                    sometimes temporarily halted.</p>
                <p>I spent part of 15 months of waiting in London, where my family was living at
                    Kingston House North, in Knightsbridge. I dearly love that city. My father was
                    still with Mobil Oil, now in charge of that company's Middle East interests.
                    Tragically, my mother was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. She would
                    become disoriented for reasons neither my father nor I could understand for a
                    long time. Every passing day without a Foreign Service appointment in the mail
                    made me increasingly impatient. I began to consider other careers, and decided
                    to take advantage of this waiting period to do things I would be unable to do in
                    government service.</p>
                <p>I moved to Paris for a while to improve my French and gain an appreciation of
                    that city, and for the first two months of 1958 stayed on the left bank in a
                    run-down hotel on the rue Toulliers, off the rue Soufflot. I lived frugally and
                    quickly ran through my savings from the Navy, learning to fill up on fresh bread
                    spread with mustard, a combination I still like. I became an auditeur libre at
                    the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques of the University of Paris, attending
                    courses on foreign affairs such as French colonial policy in West Africa. When I
                    finally entered the Foreign Service my first post was Abidjan, in the Ivory
                    Coast of French West Africa. I recalled crowded lectures at the “Sciences Po” on
                    the benefits of French rule and the pride and sometimes condescension in the
                    professor's views of what would soon become France's former colonies in West
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>My friends in Paris were mainly French, and artists of one kind or another. While
                    my life wasn't bohemian, it wasn't bourgeois either. I fell in love, walked the
                    streets endlessly in all kinds of weather, reading in my room about American
                    writers in Paris and their movable feasts after the first world war. The heart
                    of the left bank had not yet acquired its smart boutiques and glitzy tone. It
                    was far more a Paris of the photographer Atget who died in 1927, and I felt
                    myself deeply drawn to its aspect and atmosphere. My memories of being young,
                    alone, and nearly broke in Paris are like the leisurely flow of an adagio; they
                    are, perhaps, my way of saying farewell to youth itself.</p>
                <p>In April and May of 1958, I visited the Soviet Union. After Khrushchev's
                    assumption of power, it had opened up slightly for Westerners. I joined a group
                    of journalists, mostly British, under the bogus claim of being a reporter for
                    the Rhinebeck Gazette in Duchess County, New York. It was true I had written
                    some pieces for the Gazette while at Bard College, but that was eight years
                    earlier. We would spend three weeks in the Soviet Union and Poland, learning
                    mainly by observation because few dared talk with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>This trip was the first Russian tour for Western journalists organized from
                    London. We were shepherded around the Soviet Union by an Intourist guide, Irena,
                    a hard-nosed young red-head who did not let us out of her sight. She never
                    passed up a chance to get in a nasty crack about the West and its “corruption.”
                    Despite Irena's focus on the achievements of communism, we managed to see quite
                    a few historic landmarks, which became even more interesting when examined with
                    a 1914 Baedeker on Russia in hand. Before leaving London on this trip, I visited
                    George Kennan who was spending a year at Oxford preparing his Reith Lectures. I
                    wrote to him asking for an appointment, which he kindly granted me. We had
                    coffee and cake in the kitchen, with his children running about. I sought his
                    advice on what one might do in preparing to joining the Foreign Service, and
                    what steps I might take to understand the Soviet Union in the time I had before
                    me.</p>
                <p>Kennan's first suggestion was that I find a pre-war Baedeker guide book and look
                    at the old maps, particularly those of Leningrad. I should count the canals as
                    we crossed them in that city, and identify the old buildings by checking their
                    location and description in the Baedeker. Kennan thought this would give me an
                    appreciation of cities no Soviet tour guides could provide, since they would not
                    know or wish to talk about Czarist times. I placed an ad in the London Times for
                    a Baedeker on Russia, and the night before my departure an American journalist
                    called and sold his 1914 edition for ten pounds. I found my Baedeker
                    indispensable on every trip I have taken to the Soviet Union. In Leningrad it
                    permitted me, for example, to determine that the Anti-Religious Museum was
                    housed in the former Kazan Cathedral.</p>
                <p>In a closing of the circle, I lent my Baedeker to George Kennan when he returned
                    to the Soviet Union in 1976, for the first time after his ouster as ambassador
                    by Stalin. We were dinner guests of the Matlocks in Moscow, when Jack was deputy
                    chief of mission. I reminded Kennan of our conversation at Oxford and he was as
                    delighted to borrow the Baedeker as I was to lend it.</p>
                <p>I did, in fact, write eleven articles in London after my trip, which the
                    Rhinebeck Gazette published in the winter of 1958, paying me $1.50 for each.
                    (”Normally, all of the columns in the Gazette run between 75 cents and $1.00 per
                    week,” the editor Michael Strong wrote to me. “However, in this case I feel they
                    are worth the $1.50...”) This was only five years after Stalin's death, so
                    Russian travel pieces were a novelty in the American press. McCarthyism and a
                    Fortress America mentality were running strong, and little was understood in our
                    country about ordinary Russians and their daily life.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>In these articles, I wrote about nearly empty stores in Leningrad and Moscow in
                    1958, and the way Russians in the street stared at the well-made shoes of
                    foreigners. Counting Leningrad's canals in my Baedeker, I saw that a mansion
                    accommodating grocery shops on the ground floor and crowded apartments above was
                    formerly the Club of the Noblesse. In this city's once elegant Astoria Hotel,
                    marble plaques advertising manicures and pedicures had not been taken down; the
                    shabbily dressed people in its lobby suggested a John Steinbeck cast run amuck
                    on a Noel Coward set. In the restaurant, a Russian entertainer sang, “I Love
                    Paris in the Springtime,” she who was prevented from traveling abroad.</p>
                <p>I described an unintentionally funny fashion show put on by Dom Modeliy, and the
                    Soviet procedure of proposing new dress patterns first to a council of
                    manufacturers and designers, and after that to a committee of light industry,
                    planning and trade. At a soccer match, I cheered as the Spartaks from light
                    industry tied the Torpedo auto workers 3-3. At a primary school I saw impressive
                    training in the English language and sciences, although I did not doubt
                    Intourist had chosen its show-piece school carefully. On Red Square, I witnessed
                    a May Day parade with its impressive and dispiriting display of Soviet military
                    prowess, while Khrushchev and Egypt's General Abdul Nasser, who was his guest,
                    stood on top of the Kremlin Mausoleum.</p>
                <p>Inside that mausoleum, where foreign visitors like ourselves were put at the head
                    of a very long line standing for hours in the cold, I saw at the bottom of a
                    long flight of marble steps two glass-covered caskets in a cool, softly-lit
                    marble room. The first thing I noticed was Stalin's profile reflected on the
                    wall opposite his bier. The line filed past Lenin's waxy but well-preserved
                    remains, a small, lean man with pointed features, high forehead, beard and
                    moustache. Passing Lenin's casket, I stood at the feet of Stalin. Viewed in this
                    perspective, with an accent on his chin, Stalin's features were hard and
                    unmistakably cruel. In profile, however, the dictator had a fatherly, almost
                    benign appearance. He was dressed in the familiar and simple military tunic of
                    his war-time days.</p>
                <p>I concluded the series with a quotation from the novelist Nikolai Gogol: “The
                    Russian possesses a multitude of good qualities and a multitude of defects. As
                    is usual with Russians, both are mingled within him in a sort of picturesque
                    disorder.” “In other words,” I wrote, “he's a bit like you and me.”—</p>
                <p>Discouraged by this wait in limbo, I decided to return to Washington to learn
                    where matters stood at the State Department and was assured I would be in a
                    junior officers' class in about four months. Before I left London, I became
                    engaged to Marie (Mary) Cheremeteff, a woman of Russian origin living there with
                    her family, whom I met through her aunt-out-of-a-Chekhov play, Sofka Dolgoruka.
                    Sofka was the tour leader of our band of journalists visiting the Soviet Union,
                    an unusual arrangement for a Russian princess, but Sofka's views on communism
                    were ambivalent and she was a great propaganda catch for Intourist. Both
                    families had occupied prominent places among the Russian nobility.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I had invited Sofka to see an acclaimed Soviet film at the Curzon Cinema, “The
                    Cranes Are Flying,” and she afterwards proposed we visit the Cheremeteffs in
                    Hampstead, saying there was someone I should meet. There I found a beautiful
                    woman with large dark eyes, who was sometimes asked whether she wasn't the
                    actress Natalie Wood. Mary was born in Athens and grew up in Limassol, Cyprus.
                    Her father, Nikita, was a captain in the merchant fleet who had become an
                    engineering specialist for the Italian Sitmar Lines; her mother, a generous and
                    uncomplicated woman, was a skilled cook of Greek and Russian dishes. Both
                    parents were born in Russia, and Nikita and his cousin Sofka played together in
                    the czarist court. Mary spoke Greek, Russian and French quite fluently, and
                    seemed to me, never mind that soon I was in love with her, someone who would
                    enjoy foreign service life and enrich it by her distinctive Russianness. She
                    also had never been to America.</p>
                <p>Back in Washington in January of 1959, I rented a one-room efficiency apartment
                    on the top floor of 3226 N Street, in the heart of Georgetown, and decided again
                    to find work I would not be able to do after entering the Foreign Service. I
                    wrote a brief resum� and for several days walked the halls of Capitol Hill,
                    offering to work for fifty dollars a week. No one in the Senate was interested,
                    but Congressman Chester Bowles' office was. Bowles represented the Second
                    District of Connecticut. His administrative aide, Thomas L. Hughes, hired me on
                    the spot and for the next three months I worked there. It was exhilarating to be
                    in Washington at last, with formal studies and military service behind me, and a
                    diplomatic career and marriage only months away. Starting to work for Bowles, I
                    already felt myself a minor player in a grand scene. A placid Eisenhower
                    presidency was ending; America's future would be exciting. Forsythia and
                    daffodils bloomed along N Street, and life was wonderful.</p>
                <p>I sat at a typewriter table with collapsible wings on each side, my personal
                    space in Bowles' crowded, frantic office. I answered the mail, worked a bit on
                    speeches, talked to visitors, and met with lobbyists no one else wanted to see,
                    particularly those from the New Haven railroad unions. I attended Bowles' staff
                    meetings, which were always interactive and extremely frank. Those three months
                    were a major learning experience for me, and fun. Bowles, although a first-term
                    congressman, had a seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee because of his
                    international experience. I gained many an insight into how foreign affairs were
                    dealt with by the congress. Like other staff members, I would brief Bowles on
                    subjects to be covered by the committee, as we nearly ran from meeting to
                    meeting. I came to enjoy the deal-making of congressional politics and respect
                    hard working staffers on Capitol Hill.</p>
                <p>I was inspired by the idealism of the late 1940s and early '50s as embodied in
                    Adlai Stevenson's campaign, the United Nations and the Marshall Plan. There was
                    a new spirit in the country that supported internationalism as an outcome of the
                    war. That sentiment was brought home to me during the months I spent in 1959
                    with Chester Bowles, who was at the forefront of the post-war internationalists
                    and neo-Wilsonians. He helped define America's expanded role, and our emerging
                    interests in Africa, Asia and Latin America as no one else in public life was
                    doing. For me, there was nothing dull about the fifties.</p>

                <p>2THE A-100 FOREIGN SERVICE ORIENTATION COURSE: APRIL, 1959</p>
                <p>A The Rosslyn Garage</p>
                <p>I was thirty, a veteran, and engaged to be married when I entered the Foreign
                    Service in April, 1959. The Rogers Act, which established the Foreign Service,
                    had been in force for only 35 years. It led to the creation of a Foreign Service
                    School located in room 100 on the A corridor of the State-War-Navy Building, now
                    the executive office building adjacent to the White House. There were about
                    twenty new officers in my class, including Allen Holmes, William Miller, and
                    Nicholas Platt, all to become ambassadors. Two women and no minorities were
                    included. Ours was the first class entering the Foreign Service in many months.
                    Three or four members would resign early; the majority remained in the service
                    for full careers.</p>
                <p>We reported for “orientation” to the State Department's Foreign Service
                    Institute, by then accommodated in a minimally renovated garage at Arlington
                    Towers Apartments in Rosslyn, Virginia. This arrangement reflected the priority
                    accorded training and the level of resources the Department was willing to
                    commit to this function 12 years into the Cold War. The A-100 course, as it is
                    still called, was unimaginative in content and presentation. We were lectured
                    most of the day on bureaucratic matters, and met with few senior officers.</p>
                <p>At the end, we called on the seasoned Soviet and Middle East expert Loy
                    Henderson, then deputy under secretary for administration. He met with us
                    briefly and said, among other things: “From time to time in this business you
                    will find yourself in the doghouse. Don't worry about it. The chances are you
                    will get out soon!” It was a puzzling but useful piece of advice from someone
                    who had experienced the doghouse himself more than once.</p>
                <p>The A-100 course asked little from its participants. During four months, it
                    filled our heads with organizational diagrams, acronyms, and lines of authority,
                    including one month devoted to consular functions in which a usually grim Dr.
                    Auerbach lectured endlessly on visas. We were provided information about other
                    agencies without being let in on the jealousies, posturing, conflicts,
                    bureaucratic “turf” issues, and competing interests involved in these
                    relationships.When I became director of the Foreign Service Institute nearly 30
                    years later, I made the content and delivery of the A-100 course one of my chief
                    concerns. Like my more recent predecessors, I intended to instill in our future
                    diplomats a sense of pride in public service, patriotism, and understanding of
                    America's Cold War role and burdens.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I asked, along with a few others in my class, to be assigned to sub-Saharan
                    Africa, intrigued by the prospect of serving outside Europe on a continent
                    slowly becoming of interest to the US government as the old colonial powers
                    retreated and Macmillan's “winds of change” began to blow. In the State
                    Department, Africa was largely ignored, except for South Africa. There were few
                    officers in 1959 working on African affairs, and those who did covered vast
                    expanses. Above all, I was influenced by Chester Bowles' conviction that these
                    colonies destined for independence were becoming increasingly important to
                    us.</p>
                <p>I was also influenced by our civil rights movement then gaining strength. It
                    focused attention on black Americans who were beginning to explore their African
                    heritage and take pride in it. When John Kennedy was elected, his first
                    projected appointment in foreign affairs was former Governor of Michigan G.
                    Mennen Williams, whom he designated to be assistant secretary of state for
                    African affairs. Significantly, he announced this appointment before he proposed
                    Dean Rusk as secretary, or filled other senior foreign affairs positions. I was
                    already in West Africa by then, but to me this was further indication of
                    America's interest in a politically exploding region.</p>
                <p>B An Offer to Resign</p>
                <p>Our class was sworn in on the last day of orientation by a simple recitation of
                    the oath of office in our garage quarters, without the ceremony and senior
                    speakers these stirring occasions now command in the State Department's
                    ceremonial Benjamin Franklin Room. We felt the thrill even so.</p>
                <p>With this necessary business over, I went immediately to the director general's
                    office in the State Department to submit my resignation. What a short career, I
                    thought to myself, less than an hour. Christian Herter had succeeded John Foster
                    Dulles after he died from cancer. In a three-line memorandum to Herter I had
                    written and rewritten to make it exactly right, I cited the Foreign Service
                    regulation obliging an officer intending to marry a foreign national to submit
                    his resignation, pro forma, pending a satisfactory security clearance of the
                    prospective bride. My intended wife was a British subject of Russian background.
                    Such resignations were rarely acted upon, but there mine was. I added words of
                    hope that it would not be accepted.</p>
                <p>On October 9, 1959, the acting chief of personnel, Joseph J. Jova, wrote to me at
                    my first posting in Abidjan saying “...it is a pleasure to inform you that your
                    request for permission to marry Miss Marie Cheremeteff has been approved and
                    that your resignation from the Foreign Service has not been accepted.” We were
                    married in London on November first.</p>
                <p>3VICE CONSUL, ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST: 1959-61</p>
                <p>A Breaking New Ground</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Our first Foreign Service assignments were announced to us toward the end of the
                    State Department's A-100 orientation course for new officers in a suspenseful
                    reading of a list one never forgets. When my name came up, our genial course
                    chairman said, “Abidjan.” I had never heard of Abidjan. The American Consulate
                    had been open for a year and a half in French West Africa's Ivory Coast. My
                    reaction was not unusual; few Americans, and I was no exception despite my
                    auditeur libre indoctrination in Paris, knew much about Africa and several of my
                    colleagues were as uninformed as I about their African posts. Abidjan seemed
                    just what I wanted. The consul in Abidjan was Donald R. Norland, our foreign
                    service secretary was Marion Markle. Marion was a pioneer in every sense of the
                    word. She did the work of at least three people, struggling with cumbersome
                    “one-time” encryption pads into the late hours of the night, usually cheerfully.
                    She was thrilled to be in Abidjan. I don't know what we would have done without
                    her; she deserves much of the credit for our work.</p>
                <p>The CIA placed an agent and his secretary at the consulate as part of its plan to
                    establish a presence rapidly in African countries about to shed colonial rule.
                    This was my first experience with intelligence operatives, or “spooks,” as some
                    liked to call them. Quite evident in their behavior, including to our African
                    employees, was a pattern of detachment from other government work at the post,
                    separate agendas and contacts, and special, isolating physical requirements for
                    their “base” within our office—despite the affable personalities of these two
                    people, soon to become four. They did little to dispel the aura of difference
                    and surreptitiousness surrounding their work, relishing the wink of an eye at
                    someone like me if I seemed curious. The ground rules for relations between the
                    State Department and intelligence agencies were not well defined in 1959. Often
                    Norland and I did not know what our colleagues were up to, having to depend on
                    their good will to provide us scraps of information beyond the reporting we were
                    authorized to read, much of which was not particularly novel or necessary to
                    know.</p>
                <p>Abidjan was a constituent post of Dakar, then headed by Consul General Donald
                    Dumont, one of the few African hands of the State Department in those times.
                    Dumont, in turn, was responsible to our ambassador in Paris, Amory Houghton,
                    following the colonial administrative pattern. None of the French African
                    colonies had yet become independent when I arrived in the Ivory Coast, which
                    achieved its independence in August, 1960 while I was there.</p>
                <p>Before I left Washington, the “country desk officer” in the State Department, who
                    managed our relationships with all of West Africa, briefed me; he had never been
                    to Abidjan and therefore could not tell me much about the city. Our pre-war
                    coverage of Africa had been spotty, in part because our interests were largely
                    commercial and managed by businessmen, and also in deference to British, Belgian
                    and French spheres of influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>In the late summer of 1959, I flew to Abidjan via Paris and Senegal. In both
                    places, I spent a couple of days being briefed by foreign service officers
                    knowledgeable about the area. In Paris, our embassy followed African affairs
                    closely, particularly because of de Gaulle's attention to France's colonies and
                    their impending independence. As a courtesy, I called on an African expert at
                    the Quai d'Orsay, the foreign ministry, where I was escorted down the hall by a
                    formally clad usher wearing white gloves. In Dakar I met people with whom I
                    would be working in the future, especially in the consular and administrative
                    areas.</p>
                <p>No “post report” describing local conditions existed, nor were there yet people
                    in Washington who had served in Abidjan, since it was such a recent addition to
                    the foreign service family. People from Dakar had traveled there before the post
                    was opened, but I did not have access to them while in Washington. I was not
                    well prepared; at first, I did not know for certain whether many of the streets
                    were paved. I was told my personal belongings in Washington would take a long
                    time to ship. They say in the Foreign Service that if you are sitting on a beach
                    and a large wooden crate with your name on it washes up, your household effects
                    have arrived. It would be an exciting place to begin a marriage.</p>
                <p>Three months after reaching Abidjan, I returned to London where my fianc�e Mary
                    lived, and we were married in a solemn Russian Orthodox ceremony. Filled with a
                    sense of adventure, we set up our household in a small villa outside
                    Treichville, overlooking the lagoon above the Port-Bouet road to the airport. An
                    overgrown garden surrounding our home had big, old trees. The local railroad ran
                    in back, we had a chicken coop and snakes, some poisonous. There was one
                    air-conditioner for the bedroom—all the Foreign Service would provide. This
                    meant the rest of the house was hot and steamy, with pink lizards running along
                    the walls and across the ceilings. Mary and I once rode the train from
                    Ouagadougou to Bobo Dioulasso and discovered, to our dismay, that the lavatory
                    at the end of our carriage had a chimpanzee chained to the shower pipe.</p>
                <p>Treichville itself was an overcrowded African subdivision of Abidjan in which the
                    small mud houses along dirt roads were covered by corrugated tin roofs, and
                    young children clad only in little shirts ran everywhere taking their flies
                    along. Lebanese merchants sold nearly anything, but mostly, it seemed, bicycle
                    tires; women selling manioc, or cassava, sat on solid wooden stools their men
                    had carved. Men of all ages made morning rounds balancing on their heads huge
                    jugs of bangui, a milky, frothy, potent palm wine, offering the same tin cup to
                    anyone who would buy. In the evening, Treichville was lit by kerosene lamps and
                    music was everywhere, blaring from radios or resonating from the drummers and
                    singers of the street. From our home, on nights that were still, we could hear
                    these muffled sounds as we sat on our terrace at the end of the day enjoying a
                    drink and watching the sun set before us, reflecting its fading light in the
                    lagoon and against an always cloud-filled sky.</p>

                <p>We had battles with the consulate general in Dakar over money for such
                    necessities as curtains, furniture, and replacement of inadequate kitchen
                    equipment. Our CIA representatives, and eventually those from our aid mission,
                    had no such problems. It was the standard argument one has with the State
                    Department's budget people whenever something new is started, frustrating at
                    first, but one soon learns how to make the best case. This experience served me
                    well when I opened our embassy in East Berlin fifteen years later, in 1974.</p>
                <p>Beyond the wet heat and frequent rains (Abidjan, along the coast, is said to have
                    two seasons that repeat themselves—the big rainy, and little rainy), there were
                    hardships we could not avoid: isolation in a setting of foreign languages and
                    remoteness—mail from abroad was slow and usually came in diplomatic pouches in
                    an era before jet planes served West Africa; inadequate medical facilities in a
                    place where road accidents, malaria and other tropical diseases were
                    commonplace; and a mere handful of other Americans with whom to socialize. At
                    the consulate, only Pat and Don Norland had small children. Their daughter
                    Patricia was born in Abidjan, and it was my pleasant duty to record her birth
                    and US citizenship. All three Norland children are now in the Foreign Service.
                    Learning at least pidgin French was obligatory for our small staff. The
                    satisfactions of life for us in West Africa lay outside any replication of
                    American communities, common at larger posts, and were found instead in the
                    excitement of being uprooted and culturally transplanted into unfamiliar and
                    exotic surroundings.</p>
                <p>Why were we Americans there? Sub-Saharan Africa, although of only peripheral
                    importance during the Cold War for its strategic resources and the need to
                    counter Soviet and Chinese influences, was of increasing interest to
                    African-Americans and foreign policy experts. Many of its colonies were to
                    become independent in 1960, fundamentally changing the roles of the metropoles
                    of Paris, London and Brussels from which the colonies were governed. This
                    transition would proceed as smoothly as we witnessed it in Abidjan in 1960, or
                    as turbulently and destructively as it occurred in the Belgian Congo from
                    1961-65, where I would much later serve as ambassador. Such redefining change
                    could no longer be ignored by our political leaders, as President Eisenhower
                    belatedly recognized.</p>
                <p>The State Department was burdened by the paucity of its staff of a handful of
                    African experts, lacking experience and depth in much of the region. Our
                    consulates and embassies reflected US interest in being on the scene and
                    wielding what influence we could in a wave of sweeping change, a sort of
                    toe-dipping on our part into new and often unpredictable waters. Our interests
                    were also commercial and humanitarian, favoring democratic processes and
                    economic development assistance. We wanted to make friends of the new African
                    leaders, and understand their ambitions and political roots. It was never our
                    objective, nor would it have been possible, to supplant in influence, cultural
                    affinity or presence the French, British and Belgian governments who were
                    aligned with us against the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Our consulate, reached by a small and clunky elevator, was located in the only
                    high-rise building near the main square, close to the Hotel du Parc, formerly
                    the Bardon. The square below was filled by vendors of African wood carvings by
                    day and, at night, by the chirping of thousands of bats hanging from the trees.
                    We were assisted by two invaluable local employees, one of whom was a Ghanaian,
                    Mr. Adams, who worked on consular matters, and the other a Lebanese, Mr. Merheb,
                    who concentrated on administrative concerns. Both spoke fluent English and
                    French, so our visitors had no problems communicating with them. Mr. Adams, in
                    his sixties, could be refreshingly direct. At certain times during the day when
                    I was not available, he would tell callers on the phone, “Mr. Grove is in the
                    toilet.” No “away from his desk” for him.</p>
                <p>My tour in the Ivory Coast was everything I hoped it would be. Abidjan in 1959-61
                    was a quite modern, even handsome city. It had only one bridge across the
                    lagoons, the four-lane Felix Houphouet-Boigny Bridge, named after its president.
                    We found the town itself enjoyable for its African culture and stubbornly French
                    veneer, good restaurants, and fresh food available in the markets, either
                    locally produced or flown in from Paris. The small French Institute for Black
                    Africa museum of culture and art was superb, and we went there often. I found
                    the Ivorians along the coast were more sullen than those living inland, such as
                    the Senoufo, who seemed particularly open and friendly, but we enjoyed them
                    all.</p>
                <p>The French and ourselves were the foreign powers represented. Of great importance
                    to us was our proximity to the musty and unscrubbed PTT, the Post and Telegraph
                    Office, which reeked of urine and served as our communications link to the rest
                    of the world. We sent coded and clear messages to Dakar and Washington through
                    the local telegraph system. My responsibilities were primarily the things
                    Norland did not want to do himself. This was chiefly consular, administrative
                    and commercial work, although I got involved in nearly everything else as well.
                    Tall, blond, serious and a powerhouse tennis player, Norland was a fine boss:
                    generous, open, ready to teach a newcomer. He was well along the road to
                    becoming one of our leading Africanists. We worked well as a team, and I was off
                    to a fortunate start.</p>
                <p>In Abidjan we became accredited to four colonial entities, then called the Ivory
                    Coast, Upper Volta, Niger and Dahomey. These four countries belonged to a
                    customs union known as the Conseil de l'Entente. They were still part of French
                    West Africa, but had their own nearly autonomous governments, and were combined
                    by the State Department into one consular district which Abidjan served. The
                    French had agreed to this arrangement, pleased, no doubt, by the low-key nature
                    of our involvement. When these countries achieved their independence in August
                    of 1960, we in Abidjan became the US diplomatic establishment for the four
                    capitals: Abidjan (Ivory Coast); Ouagadougou (Upper Volta, now Burkina); Niamey
                    (Dahomey, now Benin); and Cotonou in land-locked Niger, not to be confused with
                    Nigeria to its south. These are the lines colonizers drew.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>On the day of independence, Norland climbed on a chair outside our door. He
                    changed our tin shields, replacing the consular one with “Embassy of the United
                    States of America” which we had received in the diplomatic pouch. From the
                    chair, he announced to us that he had become charg� d'affaires, and I third
                    secretary. We drank champagne. We were now accredited to all four countries,
                    with no representation in the other three, leaving coverage to our circuit
                    riding efforts. Norland would retain his status as charg�, pending the
                    appointment of a permanent US ambassador.</p>
                <p>The process of independence in French West Africa in those distant days proceeded
                    smoothly. We were soon joined by a German diplomat, the young Claus von Amsberg,
                    a man of movie star good looks and manners, who would soon meet and marry
                    Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, now its queen. Adam Watson, then the
                    British consul general and later ambassador in Dakar, had even broader territory
                    to cover. He was at his amusing best describing to Mary and me his attendance at
                    the Togolese celebration, and his temptation to join dancers in the streets of
                    Lom� singing, “Isn't it grand! Isn't it grand! In-de-pen-dent Togoland!” In the
                    Belgian Congo, however, a different scenario was playing itself out during five
                    years of violence and attempts at secession in Elisabethville (now Lubumbashi)
                    and Stanleyville (now Kisangani). The Marxist Lumumba was murdered, and Joseph
                    D�sir� Mobutu came to power with US government support.</p>
                <p>The prominent African who would become president of the Ivory Coast, Felix
                    Houphouet-Boigny, was a short, lithe man, with very dark skin and a high
                    forehead, who liked double breasted suits. He spoke in a quiet voice, was formal
                    and protocol-conscious in his courtesy, and impatient in his ambitions. At
                    receptions he moved in a stately way through the crowd, smiling broadly with his
                    beautiful, flirtatious and much taller wife Marie Ther�se on his arm, his eyes
                    blinking and forehead glistening under camera lights. By 1961, Marie Ther�se was
                    running a chic Parisian dress shop in Abidjan.</p>
                <p>Norland found Houphouet perceptive, wise, and a shrewd appraiser of political
                    forces who, while punctilious in his dealings with French officials, was not
                    wholly controlled by them. Houphouet stood in favorable contrast to the three
                    other leaders of the Conseil de l'Entente customs union he had created, and
                    differed strikingly from such maverick, Marxist-influenced neighbors as Kwame
                    N'Krumah in Ghana and S�kou Tour� in Guinea, although he had a fondness for
                    S�kou Tour�, whom he called “my little brother.” In governing the Ivory Coast he
                    was a politician to his fingertips, managing to keep the question of a successor
                    churning in the pot for decades. Under the banner of “Fraternit�,” his authority
                    and mediating skills with African statesmen, including the perennial Mobutu of
                    Zaire, eventually made him the dean of surviving, pro-Western and like-minded
                    leaders to whom stability, unchallenged authority, and acquisition of wealth
                    were life's main goals. Unlike Mobutu, however, Houphouet worked hard to develop
                    the Ivory Coast's economic potential, and did so with minimal corruption.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In Abidjan, my training in the Navy helped me refit our Jeep with a tow rope,
                    pulley, ice chest, and other essentials for driving in thinly populated areas.
                    Once we had settled into married life, Mary and I often went on trips lasting
                    ten to fourteen days, visiting American missionaries, who were surprisingly
                    numerous and usually lived well, taking along my consular hand press seal to
                    notarize documents, register births, and so on. During these trips, I also
                    called on the local French authorities, who invariably were hospitable. There
                    was, nevertheless, a certain tension between the French and ourselves in
                    Abidjan. They were wary to the point of paranoia of what might appear to be US
                    efforts to undermine French interests in their former colonies, an unfounded
                    concern. The two French high commissioners with whom I served were prickly,
                    rather vain and pompous former colonial functionaries who found it difficult to
                    accept the new situation in West Africa. We had good reason to believe that
                    French intelligence followed our activities closely.</p>
                <p>On returning to Abidjan from circuit riding, I submitted reports to the State
                    Department on economic and political conditions as I had found them. The Ivory
                    Coast then, as today, was a country of elephants and other game, cocoa, coffee,
                    oil and mahogany. Sadly, its forests have now been depleted in characteristic,
                    exploitative disregard for the environment in Africa. I had a large map of the
                    Ivory Coast, on which I carefully noted where one could find cold beer: there
                    were not many places that offered ice and beer. This map became a prized
                    possession, much sought after by visitors.</p>
                <p>Yamoussoukro, where Houphouet-Boigny was born, was then a small town on a
                    laterite road, a place of crocodiles. Now it accommodates Houphouet's monument
                    to himself, the second largest cathedral in the world. Reached by a
                    super-highway, it is the nominal capital of the Ivory Coast. The up-country
                    Africa beyond the rain forests we drove through in the late 1950s was little
                    altered from the way it had been for centuries. It was largely untouched by
                    modernity and startlingly beautiful. I sometimes yearn for that unbordered
                    countryside. We became interested in African wood carvings and began to collect
                    them. Often they are works of elegant simplicity and great power.</p>
                <p>We could usually find, even in the remotest village, a veteran of military
                    service who spoke French. This enabled us to talk a bit about village life and
                    concerns, and begin to understand and reach out to Africans. In general, the
                    French did better by their colonies than most colonial powers in Africa.
                    Africans automatically acquired French citizenship and were able to vote in
                    French elections. Ironically, Houphouet, who believed in animism, had been a
                    minister of health in Paris. The French paid attention to education and the
                    schools were quite good. Much of the training was provided by the Catholic
                    Church with French priests and nuns as teachers and role models.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>After independence, our official visitors grew at a rapid pace. First came an
                    economic assistance planning team and soon a permanent cadre of aid experts
                    joined our embassy. Then we were visited by a Foreign Service inspection team,
                    headed by Cecil Lyon. “Soapy” Williams, former governor of Michigan and the
                    Kennedy administration's assistant secretary for Africa, came for a look. We had
                    our first congressional delegation, or “CODEL,” headed by Senator Frank Church
                    and including a young and assertive Edward M. Kennedy, then and briefly a
                    Washington lawyer, and Senator Wayne Morse. Kennedy was along as the brother of
                    the president-elect, demonstrating the New Frontier's interest in Africa. All of
                    these visitors and delegations required briefings and support from our fledgling
                    embassy. There was also an increase in private travelers. Anthropologists,
                    journalists, and tourists arrived in growing numbers. We invited some of them to
                    our homes to learn about their African experiences. Many had devoted their lives
                    to Africa and were invaluable sources of information. All of them were
                    welcome.</p>
                <p>Don Norland had easy access to the Ivory Coast government. His political
                    reporting on four countries was well regarded in Washington. Most government
                    officials, including the junior ones, were competent and politically
                    sophisticated. The French had done a good job of building up and training the
                    civil service. Even in the early 1960s, there was a question of who might
                    succeed Houphouet. It turned out to be premature, as Houphouet remained in
                    office until his death in December, 1993. I enjoyed agricultural commodity
                    reporting, particularly on the coffee crops, and became versed in coffee
                    production. One of my principal sources was a Greek coffee trader, Basil
                    Kokkinakis, whose projections of coffee crops were reliable. I gained his
                    confidence and to my great satisfaction he gave me his personal assessments of
                    coffee forecasts.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1960, the nature and extent of our representation in West Africa
                    became a matter of concern in Washington. Ambassador Loy Henderson, who was
                    deputy under secretary for administration, led a team which included Dr.
                    DeVault, director of the Department's medical operations; Joseph John Jova from
                    personnel; and John Stutesman, Henderson's special assistant. Henderson's visit
                    was the Eisenhower administration's response to Democratic candidate John F.
                    Kennedy's decision to send Averell Harriman to West and Central Africa to
                    highlight Eisenhower's neglect of Africa. Harriman came in August of 1960;
                    Henderson a few weeks later.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>In Abidjan, Houphouet-Boigny, in a reference to Cold War struggles in which his
                    ties were to the West, told Harriman: “When I send our students to Moscow, they
                    come back capitalists. When I send them to Paris, they return Marxists!” Our
                    African policies, such as they were, had become an issue in the domestic and
                    foreign affairs strategies of Kennedy's political campaign. Henderson's team had
                    its own plane and visited several countries of former French West Africa. They
                    had three basic concerns: the nature of the relationships the US should have
                    with these countries; staffing requirements to establish and maintain such
                    relationships; and levels of economic assistance appropriate in light of needs
                    and the US government's limited objectives and resources.</p>
                <p>These questions were of course inter-related, and the answers were not the same
                    for all countries. Henderson's team made impressive efforts to understand the
                    rapidly changing scene in West Africa. They had learned before leaving, for
                    example, of a post which occasionally had its only other officer, an FSO-8 of
                    the most junior rank, serving as charg� to four newly independent countries
                    during absences of the principal officer. I was not surprised Washington did not
                    favor this arrangement, although it was hardly of my making! Henderson's visit
                    made a difference. After he returned to Washington, efforts began to staff up
                    the new embassies, and quickly to over-staff them. We all began to receive
                    better administrative support from the State Department. More air conditioners
                    arrived, and we in the Foreign Service began to catch up with the living
                    standards of people from other agencies such as AID and CIA. Robert McKinnon was
                    assigned to open our embassy in Upper Volta. Tragically, he died of illness
                    shortly after his arrival. I helped him in his pioneering efforts as best I
                    could. By the time I left Abidjan in the summer of 1961, the four countries we
                    had covered from there had at least the beginnings of a US presence.</p>
                <p>Robert Borden Reams was assigned in November, 1960 as our first ambassador to the
                    four countries. We became the support post for the other three, adding to our
                    workload. By early 1961, our presence in West Africa was much more visible than
                    when I first arrived in Abidjan, and I began to wonder whether we weren't trying
                    to do too much too fast.</p>
                <p>B The First Ambassador</p>
                <p>Robert Borden Reams was a portly, balding man who was rather short and had a
                    British colonel's moustache. Quiet spoken, he was the very image of a diplomat.
                    His appearance was a bit formal and his style somewhat reserved, perhaps, but
                    those who came to know him discovered a man with a zest for exploring the world
                    around him, a raucous sense of humor and fondness for drink, and a compassionate
                    heart. Golf was his abiding interest, and travel came next. He and his two
                    daughters, Marianna and Kathy, and young son Peter, now also in the Foreign
                    Service, were with him and his wife Dottie in Abidjan. He was what my generation
                    would have called traditional and seasoned, and there was much to learn from him
                    and admire. He would soon clash, however, with the activism and youthful outlook
                    of Kennedy's New Frontier.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Independence came to the Ivory Coast rather suddenly in August, 1960; the initial
                    celebrations were hastily improvised and modest. Flags went up and down, and
                    there were parades. But an elaborate and formal celebration was postponed for a
                    year, which became a significant factor in my life as I was to return there with
                    Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy when they attended the
                    official event. The year's delay until 1962 provided these governments time to
                    organize things properly.</p>
                <p>One of the first tasks we worked on for Ambassador Reams was a trip to our other
                    three countries to allow him to present his credentials in each. Norland left
                    shortly after Reams' arrival and Rupert Lloyd, a seasoned black Foreign Service
                    officer, had become the deputy chief of mission. Reams was a great adventurer.
                    He decided he would visit the three new capitals by overland travel, and that
                    our wives would join us. He loved the Jeep I had fixed up, and the beer and
                    Aquavit in the ice chest. Dottie and Mary enjoyed the relative luxury of the
                    embassy's official Chevrolet. They, too, were thrilled to be in Africa.</p>
                <p>As we set off, Ambassador Reams and I followed behind the Chevrolet's dust in the
                    Jeep, which I drove. We went overland from Abidjan to Ouagadougou and Niamey,
                    and then Reams flew to Cotonou, while I drove ahead. It was a long trip, but
                    Reams wanted to see the African countryside, and indeed he did. We looked for
                    lions and found them occasionally, sometimes nearer than we liked. Stopping our
                    little caravan early one afternoon on a remote track road in Niger, we foolishly
                    decided to get out and walk toward a nearby lake through tall grass, which I
                    later learned was called lion grass. Reams wanted to look at birds. We were
                    unarmed. The lake was pleasant enough, but on the way back we found fresh, wet
                    tracks crossing our path in the mud. The consulate's driver, Pierre, recognized
                    them as those of a lion who had passed between us and our vehicles and was
                    nearby. There was nothing to do but keep walking in silence despite feelings of
                    panic. Once we reached our cars, Pierre was so overwrought he relieved himself
                    on the spot. Reams broke out the Aquavit as we set off smartly.</p>
                <p>Pierre, driver of the Chevrolet, was a jovial, gentle young African, who was
                    immediately caught up in the spirit of our adventure. One day, as we were
                    entering a modest-sized village, the Chevrolet developed mechanical problems and
                    stopped. A garage and filling station were nearby. Pierre was slight of build
                    and seemed even more so when standing next to Reams or me. So Pierre steered the
                    Chevrolet while Reams and I pushed it to the garage down the main street, Dottie
                    and Mary following behind us with greater dignity. The incredulous villagers
                    must have thought Pierre was a high official from Abidjan who was so important
                    that he had two foreigners, one of them of evident distinction, pushing him and
                    his car to the garage.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>The presentation of credentials to the new governments by the first American
                    ambassador was an historic event. We wanted it done with dignity and style, and
                    we were proud to be the pioneering Americans in this role. All was not entirely
                    serious, however, and there were some unexpected moments. The most formal
                    ceremony, for example, took place in Dahomey, now known as Benin. Its president,
                    Hubert Maga, was a portly man to say the least. A stickler for protocol, he
                    required ambassadors to wear formal attire, despite the heat. Maga wore his top
                    hat and cut-away, an intimidating sight. We ascended a long and grand stairway
                    to the hall where the ceremony would take place. While Maga preceded us as we
                    walked up, Reams and I noticed he was wearing bright green socks with his
                    striped pants. With due regard for the gravity of our mission, we remained
                    impassive.</p>
                <p>The credentials presentations were well covered by the African press and AFP, the
                    French news agency. The Africans gave us lots of space, particularly because we
                    were one of only a few other nations, aside from France, represented in these
                    four countries. Reams held a press conference after each ceremony. This could be
                    a problem, because his French was not particularly good. Sometimes I would have
                    to interpret, which sometimes was also a problem. Reams would read a polite and
                    formal prepared statement. We were cautious about discussing economic assistance
                    levels, a matter of obvious interest to the Africans, and the focus of
                    suspicious concern by the French who did not wish to be supplanted by anyone.
                    This issue, moreover, had not yet been fully addressed by our own
                    government.</p>
                <p>There was no effort by Houphouet to play the US off against France. He understood
                    French sensitivities and realized he needed the French more than us. The Ivory
                    Coast kept the French CFA franc (cours de franc africain) as its basic currency
                    after independence. The French held positions of responsibility in their former
                    colonies, even in the newly independent governments. Key political and technical
                    advisers often were French. We Americans were welcomed by the new governments,
                    but there would have been no advantage to them in pitting us against the French.
                    They concentrated instead on gaining as much as possible from both.</p>
                <p>C Soviet and Chinese Diplomats in West Africa</p>
                <p>Toward the end of my Abidjan assignment, I visited a colleague, George Lambrakis,
                    serving in neighboring Conakry, Guinea, to acquire a feeling for the Soviet
                    presence there. Its Marxist president, S�kou Tour�, had chosen not to remain in
                    a relationship with France, the former colonizer, and Guinea had become fully
                    independent. Already, evidence of repression, mismanagement and economic
                    stagnation was everywhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Seizing the opportunity to establish their presence, the Soviets, East Europeans
                    and Chinese opened embassies in Conakry, directly introducing Cold War tensions
                    into West Africa. They would also be in Mozambique, Ethiopia, Somalia and
                    Angola. At the heart of the continent, the Soviets were making trouble in the
                    former Belgian Congo through their influence on Patrice Lumumba and his
                    supporters. Every president from Eisenhower through Reagan was to become
                    concerned about the Belgian Congo in the context of the Cold War. In West
                    Africa, however, the Soviet threat was of a much lower order. (The Belgian
                    Congo, which later became Zaire, should not be confused with the small
                    neighboring country of the Republic of the Congo, a French colony established in
                    1891 which gained its independence in 1960, and whose wealth lies in its
                    off-shore oil deposits.)</p>
                <p>George was able to take me along to an official reception, and there I found
                    unexpected distinctions among these communist “allies.” The Chinese mingled, if
                    a bit stiffly, with Africans. The Russians kept themselves conspicuously apart
                    in their own circle, showing little interest or rapport with the many Africans
                    present, the Chinese, or anyone other than the obsequious representatives of
                    their East European satellites. This was a common social pattern, I learned,
                    probably a reflection of insecurity on the part of Soviet diplomats (but less so
                    their technicians) functioning outside areas of high priority and ideological
                    definition, and of rivalry and competition for influence between the Soviets and
                    Chinese. Marx, after all, had said little about the non-western,
                    non-industrialized colonial world.</p>
                <p>More than twenty years later, as ambassador to Zaire, I had the same impressions
                    of Russians inherently ill at ease and of sophisticated Chinese diplomats more
                    friendly toward Africans. By then a more self-assured, less regimented East
                    European community existed. At the time I served in Zaire, from 1984-87, the
                    African Institute in Moscow, a policy and research organization, was directed by
                    Anatoly Gromyko, the foreign minister's son whom I knew from East Berlin. This
                    was not a man to bring depth of understanding or cultural sensitivity to the
                    complexities of sub-Saharan Africa, or to the requirements for successful Soviet
                    policies in a diverse region whose people passionately wanted their freedom.</p>
                <p>The Russians never really understood Black Africa.4STAFF ASSISTANT TO UNDER
                    SECRETARIES BOWLES AND BALL:</p>
                <p>1961-62</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>When it came time in Abidjan to focus on my next assignment, which I knew would
                    be in Washington (it was the practice at the time to bring junior officers back
                    after one two-year tour of duty overseas) I received, to my surprise, a telegram
                    informing me that I was to be staff aide to under secretary of state Chester
                    Bowles. President Kennedy had appointed Bowles to the second-ranking position in
                    the State Department, but I had not given much thought to my few months of
                    working for Bowles on the Capitol Hill while waiting to enter the Foreign
                    Service, and had not been in touch with him afterwards. I was delighted at the
                    prospect of working for Bowles again, as my wife Mary and I left Abidjan in the
                    summer of 1961.</p>
                <p>On our return trip we flew from Abidjan to Paris, and boarded the SS UNITED
                    STATES at Le Havre, traveling first class as was then the practice in the
                    Foreign Service. Soon after we boarded the ship, a member of the public
                    relations staff approached us and asked whether my wife and I would pose for
                    pictures in the dining room. We would be photographed eating a Baked Alaska
                    dessert, as part of a promotion effort to interest people in crossing the
                    Atlantic on American flag vessels. I did not see any harm; on the contrary, I
                    thought it was a good idea to promote United States Lines. The picture session
                    went smoothly and we promptly forgot about it.</p>
                <p>Four or five months later, color photos showed up prominently in advertisements
                    in The New Yorker and other national magazines of the two of us nibbling that
                    delicious dessert in the first class dining room. It identified us as “Vice
                    Consul Brandon Grove and Mrs. Grove.” It looked elitist. A congressman from
                    Pennsylvania wrote an irate letter to the State Department. I was appalled, and
                    thought this would end my career. I went to see Frederick Dutton, the assistant
                    secretary for congressional relations; both of us feared an avalanche of letters
                    about striped pants and cookie pushers. Fred did not think my explanation of
                    trying to help US business, true as it was, would carry the day. In fact, only
                    one letter was received. I was told later that the dreaded Congressman John
                    Rooney, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee dealing with the State
                    Department's budget, had also expressed interest in this photo. It goes to show
                    that good intentions about trade promotion are not always sufficiently
                    rewarded.</p>
                <p>A Robert Kennedy in Abidjan</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>After a period of leave during which my wife and I rented the bottom apartment
                    and small garden of a house at 3409 Prospect Street, in Georgetown, I reported
                    to Bowles' office. By a series of coincidences, this assignment led to my return
                    to Abidjan in 1962 with Robert F. Kennedy. I had been working for Bowles for
                    about six months when President Kennedy decided that his brother, the attorney
                    general, should represent the US at the formal celebrations of the Ivory Coast's
                    independence, which for planning needs had been postponed a year. The choice of
                    Kennedy was dictated in part by US domestic politics and the civil rights
                    movement. Since I was one of two foreign service officers then in Washington who
                    had served in Abidjan, Lucius D. Battle, the executive secretary of the State
                    Department, suggested to John Seigenthaler, the attorney general's senior aide,
                    that I be made available to Kennedy's office to help plan the trip. Soon I began
                    working directly with Robert Kennedy. I had not known Seigenthaler or Kennedy
                    before.</p>
                <p>The first time I met RFK in the spring of 1961, he was sitting at his huge desk
                    on which he had placed both feet. Water color paintings by his children were
                    taped to the paneled walls. His sleeves were rolled up, his tie pulled down
                    below an open collar. He looked like an office boy hamming it up in the boss's
                    chair. Underneath his disheveled hair, his blue eyes were penetrating. He was
                    four years older than my 32. “Well,” he said mockingly in his Massachusetts
                    monotone, “John here tells me you're from the State Department!” This was to be
                    the first official overseas trip for the new attorney general. Soon after I
                    began working on it, he asked me to join his traveling party which consisted of
                    himself, his wife Ethel, and John Seigenthaler. We flew to Paris on a commercial
                    plane, and then went on to Abidjan the same way. By this time, I had become
                    acquainted with Kennedy and was beginning to understand his way of doing
                    things.</p>
                <p>It was obvious to me that his interest in Africa was intense and genuine. He
                    threw himself wholeheartedly into representing the president and our country. He
                    was also unfailingly impatient with the requirements of protocol. In general,
                    the smaller a country, the greater its infatuation with protocol—and we would be
                    visiting a rather small country. Kennedy, for example, professed not to
                    understand why, in a receiving line, he had to wait behind chiefs of state who
                    represented countries less powerful than the US. He did not want to recognize
                    that as a cabinet officer he had to yield precedence to any chief of state, and
                    this was not easy to explain to him. The celebrations went well. President
                    Houphouet-Boigny was delighted by Kennedy's attendance and received him
                    privately.</p>
                <p>It became apparent during the visit that Ambassador Reams did not think highly of
                    Robert Kennedy. Kennedy, in turn, found Reams a bit too low-key. He wanted our
                    ambassadors to be deeply engaged in representing the New Frontier. It was more
                    than a clash of styles. The upshot was that upon our return, Kennedy told the
                    president we needed a new ambassador in Abidjan. This episode saddened me,
                    because I liked Reams and had spoken in his defense. Reams retired and was
                    succeeded by James Wine, a political appointee from Connecticut.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Kennedy was demanding. He wanted precision in his briefings. He wouldn't accept a
                    litany of facts; he wanted analysis and probed, and then probed some more.
                    “Why?” was his favorite question. He maintained a frantic pace, compulsively
                    wanting to use every minute of the day. I rarely saw him relax. He was driven,
                    even when he played at sports, tackling everything with his New Frontier vigor.
                    This became a problem in Abidjan, where he found he had time without scheduled
                    events. Reams did not fill that time and I did not use enough imagination to
                    keep Kennedy running. There were dead spots in the program and worse ones in the
                    reception lines. The dinners seemed unending, Kennedy's patience was short, and
                    I was often on the receiving end of his dissatisfaction. When he was killed, I
                    reflected on this impatience, and the president's as well. Both seemed driven
                    and fatalistic, as if they sensed that for them time would be unfairly short and
                    there was much to be done.</p>
                <p>It was fortunate that we took Kennedy out of town. He loved the countryside,
                    where he was greeted by crowds, even though no one understood who Robert Kennedy
                    was. Villagers knew someone important had come and they responded
                    enthusiastically. There was music, dancing and palm wine. Kennedy waved, shook
                    hands, and handed out the JFK campaign's PT-109 tie-clips, which must have
                    seemed a mysterious gift to these Africans. When we ran out of tie-clips, I
                    rushed back to Abidjan for a fresh supply and was nearly forced off the road on
                    a curve by a huge truck full of lumber. Kennedy was exhilarated by these
                    experiences; the Ivory Coasters were warm and friendly and we were touched by
                    their boisterous welcome. He returned to Africa on a number of occasions,
                    focusing on South Africa. This first visit was a deeper and more complex
                    experience than he had expected.</p>
                <p>B Chester Bowles as Under Secretary</p>
                <p>I returned after the Kennedy trip to my job with Chester Bowles. His office
                    consisted mostly of people he brought into the Department from Capitol Hill: his
                    close adviser Thomas Hughes and Patricia Durand, a lively young woman who was
                    Bowles' secretary and knew nearly everything about him; Philip Merrill, later
                    publisher of The Washingtonian magazine; Samuel Lewis, an exception, who was the
                    senior foreign service special assistant though a young officer; Andrew Rice,
                    the economic and development assistance expert; Jim Thomson, who specialized in
                    Asian matters and public affairs, and myself as the junior assistant. The
                    Executive Secretariat provided department-wide support, and it was Nicholas
                    Veliotes who was our staff contact there. This was the beginning of a three-way
                    relationship for Lewis, Veliotes, and myself that lasted throughout our
                    careers.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I sat in a glassed-in office with Sam Lewis, which formed part of the Seventh
                    Floor executive suites with their dark paneling and 1940's decor. These
                    surroundings had a certain comfort and dignity in an art-deco style. Bowles'
                    foreign service staff was thin in terms of numbers and rank. Sam had recently
                    been on the Italian “desk” and was a mid-career officer at the time. I had no
                    Washington experience and only one overseas tour in West Africa. It would have
                    been wiser, in retrospect, for Bowles to have had the benefit of senior foreign
                    service representation on his staff.</p>
                <p>The office was informal, noisy and disorderly, with people walking in and out at
                    will. It also had an engaging, happy and politically-charged atmosphere which
                    did not translate into an effective or smooth operation for Bowles, and was in
                    sharp contrast to Dean Rusk's operation down the hall. Bowles thought of himself
                    as the president's point man on Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He viewed
                    himself as a policy maker and not a manager. His main incursions into management
                    were through ambassadorial appointments, which he correctly regarded as
                    substantive. He left Europe to George W. Ball, then under secretary for economic
                    affairs. Bowles saw himself as a political figure and remained involved in the
                    civil rights movement, never changing his liberal persona when he left Capitol
                    Hill and moved to the State Department. His independent attitude and erratic
                    work habits were those of an advertising executive, governor and congressman,
                    which made him especially difficult to staff. Chet's handwriting often could be
                    deciphered only by his wife or Pat Durand, and he penned many of his letters and
                    drafts of memoranda. Reading his marginal notes and instructions on official
                    papers was a challenge for us all; sometimes we gathered as a group to do
                    so.</p>
                <p>I recognized quickly that it was hard to get Bowles to focus on routine
                    bureaucratic matters, which increased geometrically when the secretary of state
                    was away and Bowles was filling in for Rusk. It became increasingly difficult to
                    get Bowles to sign or decide upon documents that required his attention. These
                    papers began to pile up on my desk and became a concern not only to me, but
                    frustrating to the Department. One day I told Pat Durand I needed an
                    uninterrupted forty-five minutes with her boss. I asked her to make sure he
                    would agree. When Bowles gave me the time, I walked into his office carrying a
                    stack of papers, and said: “Chet (we all called him that), there are some things
                    you just must do as under secretary of this department and I have a stack of
                    them here.” He and I sat down and went through the pile, document by document; I
                    summarized the contents of each paper and he reached his decisions and put his
                    initials in the appropriate places.</p>
                <p>Chet would have preferred to “toss continents around to see how they splashed,” a
                    line about him by James Reston in the New York Times. Bowles was principally an
                    idea man, by nature and preference. He once said to me: “Suppose you have ten
                    good ideas and nine turn out to be unrealistic. One is great. Do you know what?
                    You've had a great idea!” The search for good and big ideas was the Holy Grail
                    in the advertising world in which Bowles had run one of the earliest and most
                    successful ad agencies, Benton and Bowles.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>It did not take long for all of us in the office to notice serious strains
                    between Rusk and Bowles. Luke Battle, the Department's executive secretary,
                    believed it was his responsibility to minimize these strains, if he were not
                    able to bring about a reconciliation. We were painfully conscious that we needed
                    to strengthen ties between these top leaders of the Department as we saw them
                    drift apart. The differences between the two were not always over policy; the
                    strains came from personality clashes and Rusk's disappointment that Bowles was
                    not at all the sort of under secretary he wanted. Rusk was uncomfortable with
                    Bowles as his alter ego. He was annoyed by Bowles's lack of interest in so many
                    matters that were vital to the smooth functioning of the State Department, and
                    was dismayed by Bowles' single-minded but often scatter-shot focus on the
                    developing world. Rusk wanted a deputy who would help him manage the global
                    consequences of our foreign policies.</p>
                <p>Bowles made major contributions to foreign policy in 1961-62 by deeply involving
                    himself in the selection of an extraordinarily able group of ambassadors.
                    Overall, these may have been the most qualified and intellectually astute of our
                    ambassadors in this century. At the president's urging, Bowles drew on the best
                    talents in academia, business, journalism, and to a lesser extent, the Foreign
                    Service itself. He was not always comfortable with the Foreign Service and its
                    ways, believing it to be tradition-bound and conservative, Eurocentric, and
                    driven by its bipolar Cold War agenda.</p>
                <p>Bowles's voice was a constant reminder of the importance of geographic areas and
                    issues that had not been prominent before. He deplored our alliances with most
                    dictators. He kept the “Third World” on the president's and secretary's agenda,
                    where it would not have ranked so high had Bowles not been around. He
                    highlighted the non-aligned countries in ways people found increasingly relevant
                    and worthy of consideration. On the other hand, it is difficult to point to any
                    single, lasting accomplishment, either substantive or managerial, that can be
                    attributed to Bowles's imprint as under secretary.</p>
                <p>Often I heard dissatisfaction from my colleagues about appointments recommended
                    by Bowles. Some of this unhappiness stemmed from justified belief in the Foreign
                    Service that able and well qualified professionals were not being selected for
                    major posts. Rusk approved most of Bowles's nominations and vetoed a few,
                    reserving for himself key personnel decisions on some Asian and European posts,
                    in particular. The director general, Tyler Thompson, knew of impending vacancies
                    and had an opportunity to suggest Foreign Service professionals, but Bowles did
                    not see the Foreign Service as a great pool of talent for “the new diplomacy.”
                    He wanted to reach down into the organization to send middle-grade, younger
                    officers to some of the smaller embassies, and to send European specialists to
                    Latin America, for example, to broaden them. Years later, Kissinger, as
                    secretary, identified and acted on the same instinct.</p>
                <p>C Lucius D. Battle as Executive Secretary</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I learned much about the Department's operations and staffing by working so
                    closely with Lucius Battle and his team. Luke was the best executive secretary I
                    have seen during my 35 years of service. He was familiar with the substance of
                    the issues in papers that crossed his desk. He understood life at the top. He
                    had worked closely as the senior aide to Dean Acheson and had a strong policy
                    background. He recognized the bureaucratic politics of issues, within the
                    Department and beyond. Soft spoken and persuasive in the accents of Georgia, a
                    man who preferred bow ties, he had great tact and courtesy bordering on
                    courtliness, as well as a generous spirit. Luke did not equivocate. He was a big
                    man physically and spiritually, and in character always a warm person. Luke
                    worked assiduously to make sure decisions were implemented. He saw the job of
                    executive secretary as an activist's, and viewed his role, in part, as an
                    enforcer seeing to it that the secretary's and under secretary's wishes were
                    carried out.</p>
                <p>His responsibilities brought Luke into discussions with many people in the
                    Department, particularly the assistant secretaries. If any of them wished to
                    test the atmosphere on the Seventh Floor, they would call Luke. He was a channel
                    for information and a wise counselor. He had everyone's trust. Luke monitored
                    the quality of paperwork that reached the Seventh Floor. This was not a matter
                    of looking papers over to see that the margins were correct and the spelling
                    right. Blanche Halla in the secretariat did that. Luke analyzed the clarity and
                    completeness of a document and did not hesitate to return it to the author if it
                    did not meet his own high standards. His scrutiny often brought needed
                    consistency to the Department's work.</p>
                <p>The functions Luke Battle performed are essential. An American secretary of state
                    should borrow from the British system and establish a position of Permanent
                    Under Secretary in the State Department, filling it with an official from the
                    Foreign Service with many years of experience who would consider this his or her
                    crowning assignment. Such an individual should serve in that position for ten or
                    more years and, with a small and permanent staff, become the institutional
                    memory of the Department in a non-partisan and open manner, serving as a
                    principal adviser to its changing political leadership. Through greater reliance
                    on fleeting and incomplete electronic records, such as e-mail, we now risk
                    losing our understanding of the complex history of decision-making. We will have
                    an impoverished sense of where we have been and how we have reached the present.
                    The position of executive secretary, as Luke Battle managed it, is the model for
                    a permanent under secretary. I hope some day we will have both the position and
                    someone like Battle in it.</p>
                <p>D The Kennedys and Bowles</p>
                <p>Working with Chester Bowles and Robert Kennedy early in my career, and for a
                    while simultaneously, provided opportunities to contrast them. Here were two
                    people from different wings of the Democratic Party, a generation apart, serving
                    in an administration where the accent was on youth and new frontiers after eight
                    years of President Eisenhower, whose very name recalled World War II.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Bowles' roots were in the New Deal. The role of government in American life was
                    transformed by Roosevelt and the concept of a powerful executive has endured.
                    Bowles himself had been head of the Office of Price Administration, an
                    unprecedented intrusion in the domestic economy. Custodians of the New Deal
                    stayed on in Washington, or returned to Cambridge and New York. Bowles became
                    Truman's ambassador to India, first serving there from 1951-53. Like nearly
                    everyone else in public life at the time, these people were male and white,
                    mostly easterners who came from Ivy League colleges and often their law schools,
                    and were wealthy themselves or from rich families. Those who were professors had
                    little money, and there was a jibe, even in the Kennedy days, that these
                    Democrats from academe sought government positions for the pay, which was then
                    barely at subsistence levels.</p>
                <p>Friendships among people like Bowles, Adlai Stevenson, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.
                    and David Ginsburg were strengthened during the Eisenhower years. Bowles was
                    among the most prolific writers and speakers on liberal causes and foreign
                    affairs during this time, and enjoyed an influential following. When John
                    Kennedy came along, these party loyalists, and many others, constituted not
                    merely a cabinet-in-waiting but almost a government-in-waiting. They had firm
                    ideas on the leading issues and many of these ideas had their origins in the New
                    Deal. In foreign affairs, their views focused not only on the conduct of the
                    Cold War, but also on opportunities for the United States in the developing
                    countries, which made up most of the world beyond Europe. Bowles, who was
                    formally JFK's foreign affairs adviser during the campaign, and Stevenson both
                    wanted to become secretary of state. Kennedy, however, brought none of the
                    former New Dealers into his cabinet.</p>
                <p>Robert Kennedy was a man of passions whose impact, initially, was that of a tough
                    and widely disliked political manager, someone who whipped delegations and fence
                    sitters into line on the convention floor, while Bowles presided over the more
                    remote Platform Committee which embodied the liberals' views. John and Robert
                    Kennedy, like FDR, believed a strong executive was required to move America
                    forward and manage a global war, albeit of a new and colder kind. Both came from
                    the Irish ways of Massachusetts politics. Robert, in particular, was considered
                    of the fray rather than above it, and deliberately sought to take political heat
                    for his brother and keep him looking statesmanlike.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Thomas L. Hughes, Bowles' long-time associate and adviser, was at the convention
                    and recalls that Bowles viewed JFK as a man “with no moral compass,” and his
                    brother Robert as a ruthless cohort of Senator Joseph McCarthy and J. Edgar
                    Hoover of the FBI. Chet had not discouraged a “Bowles for President” movement at
                    the convention. Its placards were there for all to see, to Kennedy's annoyance.
                    Bowles announced a liberal Democratic platform without consulting Kennedy
                    beforehand. Mixed in were Connecticut politics and the conflicting ambitions of
                    men such as Governor Abraham Ribicoff, who nominated Kennedy at the convention,
                    John Bailey, Democratic state chairman, Senator Thomas Dodd, and Bowles' ad
                    agency partner William Benton, all from that New England state. Hughes describes
                    the Bowles-RFK relationship, in particular, as contemptuous on both sides.</p>
                <p>In January of 1961, nevertheless, a 36-year old attorney general, and a 60-year
                    old under secretary of state disappointed at being in a number two position,
                    began serving in the presidency of 43-year old John Kennedy. Bowles was
                    motivated by vision and the Kennedys by pragmatism; unavoidably their approaches
                    clashed. Much had to do with personalities rather than age. Averell Harriman,
                    David Bruce, and General Maxwell Taylor, for example, were considerably older
                    than the president but fit effortlessly into his world. This was for them,
                    probably, a matter of putting aside impatience with newcomers and embracing the
                    Democrats' return to power as the greater good.</p>
                <p>The new people would soon learn through mistakes, and turn to those more
                    experienced in foreign affairs. The failed Bay of Pigs invasion occurred three
                    months into JFK's presidency. Bowles learned of the impending invasion plan by
                    chance, when he was acting secretary in Rusk's absence. He warned against it in
                    a memorandum to Rusk to be passed to the president. Kennedy was widely
                    criticized for misjudgments in the Cuban operation. In Washington gossip, word
                    came back to the White House after the debacle about who had defended the
                    president at dinner parties and in conversations with journalists, and who had
                    not. Bowles, always outspoken, was not in the former column and publicly
                    incurred Robert Kennedy's wrath for his lack of support after the fact. Bowles'
                    condemnation of the war in Vietnam was deplored by Kennedy loyalists in this
                    atmosphere of suspicion about his motives. It often, in politics, does one no
                    good to be right on the issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Three months later, the Berlin wall went up in a Soviet gamble to stabilize East
                    Germany, which was hemorrhaging from the westward exodus of its population. By
                    then, Kennedy had turned for advice to Europeanists like Ball, Dillon, Taylor,
                    Nitze, Kennan and Acheson. Bowles, never a Soviet expert, had become side-lined,
                    increasingly the man to see on seemingly less pressing “Third World” issues.
                    These included India and Pakistan, China (except in its strategic relationship
                    to the Soviet Union), Southeast Asia and independence movements all over the
                    world which Chet believed could be neglected only at great cost. Bowles found
                    support for his Third World emphasis in friends such as Stevenson, Arthur
                    Schlesinger Jr., Galbraith and Harris Wofford, who were close to the president.
                    But questions early in Kennedy's administration of how to contain Khrushchev's
                    maneuvers in the Cold War, with their domestic political and economic
                    implications, quite naturally came first. Soon, too, top policy makers were
                    increasingly caught in the problems of a surrogate war in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>A man of flair whose family and social life caught the world's attention, John
                    Kennedy valued his ties to the social elites of New York, Miami and Hollywood,
                    and the glamorous, fast-living international jet set. His wife Jacqueline
                    reinforced these inclinations. In friends, he admired men of accomplishment and
                    charm who moved easily in the White House and on its dance floor, and whose
                    serious conversation and banter fit his moods and needs.</p>
                <p>Bob and Ethel Kennedy had their own social circle apart from the president's,
                    although there were overlapping friends. The problems of poverty, civil rights,
                    and wages and prices in the steel industry were bringing RFK's serious side to
                    public notice, not always favorably. One could watch him grow. Social events at
                    Hickory Hill were boisterous and fun, usually with a sophomoric twist or two.
                    The tone was set by Bob's beautiful and irrepressible wife Ethel, unperturbed by
                    the fine points of entertaining, their small children rioting everywhere, and
                    the obtrusive presence of Brumus, one of the world's largest dogs. The swimming
                    pool became a magnet in late hours, with someone being pushed or happily jumping
                    in fully clothed. Most people there loved it, among other reasons for the
                    excitement of what might happen next, but after one swimming pool incident that
                    made the papers, Ethel told me JFK had said “enough.”</p>
                <p>In Kennedy social circles this left Bowles and his wife, Steb, more out than in.
                    A handsome, well dressed Yale graduate, former governor of Connecticut and
                    congressional colleague of John Kennedy, a nearly professional class golfer and
                    millionaire by his early thirties, Bowles seemed at first glance to have much in
                    common with the president. But he had no patience for time spent idly in social
                    repartee or swimming pool shenanigans. He was a voluble talker and reluctant
                    listener, not inclined to deference or flattery. Steb was a quiet person who
                    favored Indian saris, a thoughtful, kind and perceptive woman who had no
                    interest in Kennedy goings-on and in fact found many of them undignified,
                    although she was a fun-loving person herself.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>When the Bowles' entertained in their imposing Georgetown house on N Street, or
                    around the pool, their guests were drawn from intellectual circles and the ranks
                    of liberal Democrats. Thinkers, perhaps, more than doers. The atmosphere was
                    informal, but no one would describe it as boisterous. Chet and Steb favored
                    young people, and I would find myself delighted to be talking with someone like
                    James Reston, of The New York Times, propped up by the mantel with a drink in
                    his hand. Chet's mind was clicking away on issues of Asia, Africa, and Latin
                    America, unable to let up for long even in family surroundings. It was always
                    business with Chet. His style of advocacy, even with the president, could become
                    insistent, overstated, and at times unintentionally arrogant when he lectured in
                    long memos.</p>
                <p>I had the impression that the president took Bowles seriously more often than
                    not, and respected him. Robert Kennedy always felt uncomfortable with Chet and
                    criticized his performance at the State Department to me. He grudgingly
                    respected Bowles' intellect and accomplishments, and was beginning to adopt some
                    of the values that motivated Chet so strongly. There had been serious
                    differences over covert activities in the Dominican Republic as well as Cuba.
                    Kennedy was uncertain of Bowles' loyalties and friendships, and viewed Chet as
                    someone with an agenda of his own, one which did not always match the
                    president's. A cardinal sin attributed by both Kennedys to Bowles was that he
                    leaked to the press to promote his own positions and opinions. But respect was
                    there. When I informed Bob in June of 1963 that Bowles, who had been fired as
                    under secretary 18 months earlier, had asked me to join him in India on his
                    second tour as ambassador, Kennedy's surprising reply was: “Do it. He's a good
                    man.”</p>
                <p>E Departure of Bowles</p>
                <p>My tour with Bowles ended abruptly. I was shocked to hear on the radio during
                    Thanksgiving weekend of 1961 that the president had fired Bowles. He was part of
                    what was called the “Thanksgiving Massacre,” as other changes were made in the
                    administration that day. I knew there were frictions and that Bowles was in
                    trouble, but did not realize matters had reached this stage. George Ball would
                    be the new under secretary. I was pained and felt embarrassed by the abrupt
                    manner in which Bowles' belongings were moved to a much smaller office down the
                    hall and outside the executive suite, but above all by the humiliation so
                    evident in Chet's face. He was given the lugubrious title of Presidential
                    Special Representative and Adviser on Africa, Asian, and Latin American Affairs,
                    in a job that had been created for him. Sam Lewis, Pat Durand and others of his
                    staff joined him, and some excellent papers were written, trips taken and
                    speeches given, but Chet's impact in this role was slight during the 15 months
                    he served in this function. He had been kicked upstairs to avoid an uproar in
                    the liberal wing of his party.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>There are lessons to be drawn from these events. You have to manage a bureaucracy
                    before it manages you. You cannot be a one-man show, particularly if you are the
                    number two person in a large organization; you must be part of the secretary's
                    team regardless of what you think of other members on the team. You cannot
                    operate independently at senior levels; the organization will suffer and so will
                    you. It is vital that you monitor your standing with the president and his
                    staff. You have to be willing to listen to the White House carefully, especially
                    for criticisms and suggestions, which sometimes are delivered in subtle ways.
                    And if you are someone like Bowles, it is important to know how to register
                    dissenting views without appearing disloyal.</p>
                <p>Bowles was not the right man to be under secretary. In every job he held in his
                    varied career, he had always been number one. His personality and predilections
                    did not suit the rigidity of that position, and he should not have been placed
                    in it. Dean Rusk, a rather formal man of few words, was not easy to work for.
                    Bowles could not have performed well in that job under any circumstances, or in
                    any number two slot for that matter.</p>
                <p>Bowles was most at home in the world of large ideas and concepts, but he usually
                    was not able to translate his visions into the concrete steps, time lines and
                    details that are the life blood of a foreign policy bureaucracy. In that
                    respect, Bowles and Kissinger were opposites. Kissinger, when he was secretary
                    of state not only had large ideas but knew how to move the bureaucracy in the
                    directions he had determined. Kissinger, of course, had far more power than
                    Bowles. He devised a national security apparatus to serve his objectives, and
                    was in the driver's seat of a vehicle he himself had built. He understood
                    viscerally the importance of bureaucratic power and loved the game. Bowles never
                    did. Kissinger knew how to translate his ideas into concrete actions. Bowles
                    never did. Kissinger understood the need for constant updating of his
                    instructions. Bowles never did. Kissinger knew the importance of being supported
                    by insiders of seniority, status, effectiveness, and above all loyalty. Bowles
                    never did. And Kissinger knew how to handle Nixon.</p>
                <p>Bowles had an independent political base which Kissinger never did, and was often
                    in touch with people on the Hill whom he had known for a long time, although I
                    was not sure how effective that process was for him. He had an enormous range of
                    friends in the American political arena, mostly in the liberal wing of the
                    Democratic Party. Adlai Stevenson stayed with Chet at his N Street home, and
                    they were in frequent touch by telephone when not together. Bowles felt close to
                    “Soapy” Williams, Abe Chayes, Phil Coombs, Tom Hughes and other allies in the
                    Department. Sam Lewis emerged as one of his brightest and most influential
                    advisers. Except for Sam, these people were part of Bowles' political network,
                    placed there by him. They helped him whenever they could.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Regarding Vietnam, Bowles had a clearer, deeper and more accurate understanding
                    of the risks and illogic of our growing military involvement than the Kennedy
                    brothers, Rusk, Robert McNamara in the Defense Department or, at the time, his
                    successor as under secretary, George Ball. He forcefully, repeatedly and
                    courageously articulated his beliefs and fears within the top levels of the
                    bureaucracy and to his friends. No subject churned greater passion in Bowles.
                    Our policies in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were strategically and morally wrong,
                    he argued. Many who were close to him, especially all of us on his staff who
                    tried to support him, saw his frustration and knew he was right. Tragically, his
                    views were not in fashion; there seems no better way to put it.</p>
                <p>I saw little of Secretary Rusk, although his offices were at the other end of the
                    long, paneled executive corridor on the seventh floor. At the time I thought him
                    stern and aloof. Tensions between Rusk and Bowles must have reinforced this
                    view. Many years after Rusk left the Department, in around 1980, I found myself
                    next to him at the long table in the eighth floor executive dining room, which
                    had open seating. We were three or four people having a late lunch, when he
                    joined us. For an hour or so, Rusk regaled us in his husky-voiced Georgia accent
                    with tales of his stewardship and current academic concerns. His humor and
                    laughter were infectious. He had shaped his perspectives on the past and was at
                    peace with himself. I felt privileged to see this engaging side of him.</p>
                <p>During my time with Bowles, Rusk endured the pressures of working for President
                    Kennedy in a relationship that was never close. He recognized that his deputy
                    Bowles' performance was slipping, dealt with an ever more fractious Soviet Union
                    after Khrushchev's meeting with Kennedy in Vienna, and coped with decisions
                    shaping the early stages of the war in Vietnam—to mention only some of his
                    worries. Wouldn't this agenda rob anyone of spontaneity in the State
                    Department's corridors?</p>
                <p>F George Ball as Under Secretary</p>
                <p>When Ball became under secretary, I was asked to stay on as his staff aide. Sam
                    Lewis was replaced by Arthur A. Hartman, who would later serve as ambassador to
                    France and Russia. Art had served in Paris in the European Cooperation
                    Administration, working closely with Jean Monnet, and in Saigon from 1956-58.
                    Urbane, a man who listened more than he spoke and then gave unambiguous advice,
                    he was an economist, a realist, a brilliant career diplomat who was something of
                    a pessimist.</p>
                <p>Ball was a great contrast to Bowles in personal and managerial style. He
                    functioned with a small and extraordinarily competent staff, which included such
                    people as Robert Schaetzel, Stan Cleveland and George Springsteen. All of them
                    were first-class professionals. Ball was a lawyer and a man of keen intellect;
                    he was rather aloof, and more reserved than his predecessor.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Ball liked to hold meetings, but only small ones. He focused on Europe's economic
                    issues, particularly those that concerned Jean Monnet, one of the founding
                    fathers of the European community. His office was disciplined and buttoned up;
                    it had none of the political campaign flavor that Bowles' had. It was hushed,
                    efficient, and business-like, except for drinks at the end of the day. Ball's
                    domineering and short-tempered secretary scared us all, unlike the ever-cheerful
                    Pat Durand. She guarded the gate jealously, and I have seen grown men turn
                    queasy in her glare. Ball's management style was low key, crisp, and effective.
                    He knew how to make things happen. He was a man of conscience and firm values, a
                    side of him not quickly appreciated.</p>
                <p>I worked on the seventh floor during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962.
                    Chester Bowles was not involved in the deliberations. These two weeks, as far as
                    we know, were the closest the world came to a nuclear exchange during the Cold
                    War. Only much later did I understand George Ball's wise and calming role during
                    President Kennedy's handling of this crisis, his emphasis on a political and
                    diplomatic approach to Khrushchev rather than a knee-jerk US military response
                    in Cuba as the first option.</p>
                <p>Ball demanded precision, logic, and well reasoned recommendations, as one would
                    expect from the successful lawyer he was. I learned how a number two in a large
                    organization could be effective and have an impact on the bureaucracy. Luke
                    Battle, the executive secretary, while personally fond of Bowles, settled back
                    in relief as the Department returned to its more accustomed and efficient
                    ways.</p>
                <p>One of the first things Ball did was to insure that his relationship with Dean
                    Rusk remained close. He knew how to read and serve the secretary. Sadly, that
                    was not a matter to which Bowles had devoted much time. My role changed as well.
                    When I attended meetings in Ball's office, it was as note-taker and recorder of
                    decisions. Afterwards, I would follow-up to insure that these decisions were
                    properly disseminated. Ball was formal and moved in his own world. It would
                    never have occurred to me, as a junior aide, to call him “George.”</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Vietnam at the end of the Eisenhower administration began to emerge as a Cold War
                    issue of a surrogate kind between ourselves and the Soviets. There are no better
                    examples of the global nature of the superpower struggle during the Cold War and
                    its capacity for clouding judgment than the ways in which we became enmeshed in
                    far-off Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. From the outset, Vietnam's potential for US
                    military involvement was troubling. The debate within our government assumed a
                    stridently ideological, often deliberately misleading, intimidating and ugly
                    character. I had already left the office when Ball became deeply engaged in
                    Vietnam, but sensed the steadfastness of his convictions and agreed with them.
                    His counsel to Lyndon Johnson during the downward-spiraling Vietnam conflict was
                    forthright and consistent in arguing for an end to the war, and isolated Ball in
                    the bellicose environment of the White House. Bowles and Ball were Democrats of
                    deep convictions, eloquence and moral fiber. Their styles, however, were polar
                    opposites: Bowles a man of passions, and Ball the cerebral master of his
                    brief.</p>
                <p>5WITH ROBERT KENNEDY AROUND THE WORLD: MARCH, 1962</p>
                <p>While I was working at the State Department as staff aide to under secretary
                    George Ball, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, with whom I had traveled to
                    Abidjan the year before, asked me to join John Seigenthaler in planning his trip
                    around the world during March of 1962. Seigenthaler, who had been a brilliant
                    investigative journalist at The Nashville Tennessean, was a top political aide
                    to Kennedy. John was a hard-driving, savvy, principled and tough newspaperman
                    with a gentle soul and winning sense of humor. He was devoted to Bob
                    Kennedy.</p>
                <p>One day while we were relaxing on an airplane, Seigenthaler—chuckling all the
                    while—confided to me how Kennedy had become attorney general, a process of
                    persuasion he had witnessed. At his N Street home in Georgetown his brother, the
                    president-elect, was leaning hard on RFK to accept the position, but Bob had
                    doubts of many kinds, including his age, lack of experience, and charges of
                    nepotism sure to follow. He wasn't convinced he could be confirmed by the
                    Senate, either. Finally, when they had worked it out Jack's way, a relieved JFK
                    told his brother, “All right, Bobby, let's grab our balls and run!”</p>
                <p>My wife and I had become friends of the Kennedys after their Abidjan trip. They
                    invited us often to Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia, where we met many of the
                    people who had been attracted to Washington by the excitement of working in the
                    new administration, and Bob's Department of Justice. Kennedy's deputies were
                    among the most talented lawyers ever to serve at the same time in the Justice
                    Department. For me, it was a privilege to come to know most of them well and
                    remain in touch with some until today. People have compared the heady mood of
                    these times, and the optimism about government's ability to do good, to the
                    early years of FDR's administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Under Secretary George Ball, for whom I then worked, was delighted to have a
                    single point of responsibility in the State Department for the detailed planning
                    that would go into this trip. As I was on his immediate staff, he would be able
                    to keep an eye on progress. I moved for several months into a windowless room
                    along the Seventh Floor executive corridor and turned it into a command center
                    of sorts. As global cable traffic increased, I was assigned a full-time
                    secretary. All outgoing messages on the trip went through this office and
                    required my clearance. There were no desk top computers then, and manila files,
                    organized by trip stops and events, began to pile up on our desks. I worked
                    without supervision, but recognized that keeping the State Department fully
                    involved and informed was the key to the trip's success. My function was often
                    that of broker, negotiating with the strong-willed attorney general on the one
                    hand, and usually wise and sympathetic, but sometimes also tradition-bound,
                    State Department professionals on the other.</p>
                <p>Kennedy made “youth” a major theme of his trip, and was scheduled to meet a lot
                    of young people in many settings. At each stop, Kennedy had a specific agenda,
                    usually proposed by the embassy. Although he went as the attorney general, his
                    brief was broader; it was more like a trip a secretary of state would make. By
                    now, RFK was recognized everywhere, and known to be the president's closest
                    confidant. Our business became diplomatic, with a focus on good will. Kennedy
                    was mindful, however, that he was the attorney general even when his briefs took
                    him into diplomatic territory.</p>
                <p>I was acutely aware of the need to have each activity planned in detail and each
                    hour of the day accounted for. These overseas stops were like a political
                    campaign, in which each event is exquisitely planned, and then modified at the
                    last minute. When changes are proposed on the spot, usually by some near-frantic
                    person, one needs to keep a calm fix on the larger objectives and be prepared to
                    yield graciously on what matters less. Sometimes, of course, spur of the moment
                    ideas can be just right. The degree of detail we worked out is illustrated by
                    cable exchanges with our embassy in Tokyo concerning the ice skate shoe sizes of
                    the Kennedys, important because one of their appearances would be at an ice
                    skating rink. They skated; the skates fit.</p>
                <p>The party consisted of Robert and Ethel Kennedy; John Seigenthaler, Kennedy's
                    special assistant; Susie Wilson, the wife of Donald Wilson, Deputy Director of
                    USIA; and myself. Susie was a close and high-spirited friend of Ethel's. We had
                    no security people. We were accompanied throughout by some fifteen American
                    members of the press corps. We traveled on commercial airlines. John
                    Seigenthaler and I “advanced” the Asian portion of the trip in seven days of
                    travel shortly before the Kennedys left. Our task was to set the agenda and
                    schedule for each stop. This gave us an opportunity to discuss what the attorney
                    general's wishes were, what the embassies' problems were, what Kennedy's remarks
                    would be, and which sites he would visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>In most places, we had a separate itinerary for Ethel and Susie, but Mrs. Kennedy
                    liked to be with her husband, so we tried to include everyone as much as
                    possible. The trip was a success due to the great amount of work the attorney
                    general put into it. He cared about what he was doing, and about furthering the
                    agenda each post and Washington had agreed upon. The Cuban missile crisis was
                    three months behind us as we set out, and the administration's prestige at home
                    and abroad was at its peak. Robert Kennedy was basically a shy and private man,
                    rather introverted, and constant public exposure was not easy for him, although
                    he radiated a natural charm with crowds, who literally turned him on as he did
                    them.</p>
                <p>We first went to Hawaii for a briefing by the US Commander-in-Chief of Pacific
                    Forces and a rest, then to Hong Kong, also primarily a rest stop, Tokyo,
                    Singapore, Saigon (airport stop), Bangkok, Beirut, Rome and Paris—all in four
                    weeks on slow airplanes. It was a grueling trip, but it had inspiring and
                    memorable moments. We became close to the press contingent, since we all sat
                    together on the planes and saw each other on the ground all the time. On a few
                    occasions, other passengers were annoyed by the antics of our party and the
                    press, particularly when we sang songs with lyrics we had made up. One couldn't
                    blame them.</p>
                <p>An example of the complexity of our relations with Vietnam occurred before our
                    landing in Saigon, in February of 1962. We had developed a habit in which I
                    would sit with Kennedy shortly before his next stop to go over the airport
                    scenario: what he was expected to do, who would be there, what he would say, and
                    so forth. Saigon was not one of the places John and I had advanced, because this
                    would be primarily a refueling stop late at night. I had not focused on
                    Kennedy's remarks until we were airborne. When I did, I was taken aback by what
                    had been written for him. I told Kennedy I thought his statement was too strong
                    in its commitment to South Vietnam's leaders, and suggested a couple of changes
                    to make it less strident. He turned to me and sternly said: “Brandon, you have
                    no idea how many clearances and how much agony this statement has gone through
                    in Washington. I'm not going to change a single word.” I was struck by the
                    tension Kennedy felt that evening.</p>
                <p>Our embassies recognized who Kennedy was and accepted him, if sometimes
                    reluctantly, as a spokesman for US foreign policy. Without exception, the
                    ambassadors were supportive and helpful. Their staffs, who worked endless hours,
                    enjoyed being involved in the razzle-dazzle that accompanied the Kennedys
                    wherever they went. Bob was good at sticking with his script; he focused on the
                    agenda and did not stray from the purposes of his visit. He did not trample on
                    many toes, and customarily accepted our embassies' advice.</p>
                <p>If anything went wrong it was usually of our own doing, like the Vespa incident
                    in Rome. Nearly a month into our trip and only days away from our final stop in
                    Paris, our traveling party decided to treat itself to the best of luncheons at a
                    Tuscan restaurant highly recommended by our “control officer,” the always
                    unflappable Robert Duemling, then a junior member of the embassy's political
                    section. It was a delightful place, its front open to the street on a seductive
                    spring afternoon. The owners were pleased to have us there, at first.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Well into lunch and wine, the press decided to present Ethel a Vespa motorcycle,
                    having observed a sales outlet a few doors down the street on their way in. As
                    they did so, Duemling heard Robert Kennedy caution her, “Ethel, remember your
                    brother-in-law!” A delighted Ethel revved up her new bike at the restaurant's
                    entrance, nearly blowing away the cheeses and some of the patrons dining
                    outdoors. She flew into the middle of traffic and hit the side of a car. It made
                    a loud thump but no one was hurt.</p>
                <p>Duemling the diplomat spoke with the driver and settled the matter on the spot.
                    We continued with lunch, the press pleased with an occasion it never reported.
                    Kennedy later asked Duemling to have the Vespa repaired and shipped to his home,
                    implying without cost, something the astonished Duemling was able to accomplish
                    by taking Vespa's public relations people into his confidence and painting a
                    seductive picture of their product in the country estate setting of Hickory
                    Hill. Duemling, a fine arts major, later became our ambassador to Suriname, and
                    president of Washington's National Building Museum when he retired from
                    diplomatic life.</p>
                <p>I was the man-behind-the-scenes on this trip, making sure that at each stop our
                    embassies did what they were supposed to do in terms of the brokered marriage
                    between their capabilities and wishes, and Bob's desires. John Seigenthaler and
                    I accompanied Kennedy on virtually every visit or appearance, including calls on
                    chiefs of state. I was the main channel for embassies to get to Kennedy and
                    vice-versa. It was long days and short nights. Kennedy was pleased with the trip
                    as it progressed. There had been one or two minor glitches, but in general the
                    media gave him high marks. It was a plus of sorts for the president, as well,
                    providing evidence of his concern for Asia and Berlin. Kennedy held press
                    conferences at all stops, during which he was asked questions about the American
                    political scene, especially on the civil rights movement. These he could answer
                    without help. If staff work needed to be done on domestic subjects, that was
                    John's responsibility.</p>
                <p>In Indonesia at the end of our third week together, all of us were exhausted. By
                    early afternoon on the day we were to take a 5:00 o'clock PanAm flight to our
                    next destination, Ethel and Bob still had not returned to their rooms. Little of
                    Ethel's wide-ranging wardrobe had been packed, and there was not sufficient time
                    for her to do this herself. I thought of what would happen if we missed our
                    plane—all along our route. In discouragement and trepidation, and with the
                    daring of the near-defeated, I began to pack her varied belongings and had
                    nearly finished when she burst on the scene and asked what I was doing. “Ethel,”
                    I said slowly and I hope thoughtfully, “This is a real world with real people
                    and real airplanes. PanAm isn't going to hold the plane for us!” She wasn't
                    pleased but said nothing further about it. During a reunion of our travel group
                    at Hickory Hill soon after we got back, Ethel, with a sweet smile, slipped me a
                    small leather box and said, “Bobby and I want you to have this.” Inside were two
                    gold cufflinks, one inscribed “Real World,” the other “Real People.” On their
                    backs were the initials RFK and BHG.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Kennedy kept his focus on young people, seeing them as future leaders and a
                    natural audience for the vision and dynamism of the New Frontier. His opinion of
                    the Foreign Service, as he became acquainted with it during his overseas
                    travels, rose sharply. He was impressed, repeatedly, by individual officers he
                    met. He was also impressed by how hard embassies worked and how close our posts
                    were to the mood and feelings of the local populations, as well as the
                    leadership groups. People working at our embassies became real and human to him.
                    He saw how good they were, and came to like and respect many of them. This was a
                    different world from his father's embassy in pre-war London, where Ambassador
                    Joseph Kennedy became isolated and disliked for his accommodationist views
                    toward Nazi Germany.</p>
                <p>Kennedy had opinions about each American ambassador he met, some of which he
                    shared with me. There were pluses and minuses, but he came away from this trip
                    impressed, grudgingly perhaps, by the chiefs of mission he had seen. He did not
                    like to meet with their “country teams,” a relatively new concept of interagency
                    staff meetings with the ambassador, although we did so in a couple of places. He
                    preferred a one-on-one dialogue, believing he would get more honest and targeted
                    briefings that way and avoid the posturing in formal meetings.</p>
                <p>As I had learned in Africa, conventional protocol bothered RFK; he did not like
                    to do things for form's sake. We kept the ceremonial aspects of the trip to a
                    minimum, but this was still too much for Kennedy. He once tried to leave an
                    elaborate and seemingly endless dinner in Indonesia, hosted by its attorney
                    general, Dr. Gunawan, who wore a military uniform. He kept sending me rather
                    obvious signals indicating he wanted to depart, which would be impossible
                    without seriously offending our host. I signaled back that he couldn't go. His
                    solution to boredom took a drastic turn. After watching a long and graceful
                    display of Indonesian dances, Kennedy announced that Susie Wilson and I would
                    perform a popular American dance, the Charleston. And we did, sans music.</p>
                <p>Astronaut John Glenn had orbited the earth while we were in Rome, thus rivaling
                    Yuri Gagarin's accomplishment. People were stopping Americans on the street to
                    shout their bravos. Pope John XXIII blessed our group, including the
                    journalists, saying that his few words “will not do any harm to those of you who
                    are not Catholic.” On meeting me, he memorably said: “You are a big man. I am a
                    small man who seeks to do big things in the hearts of men.” In Berlin, we got a
                    shocking first look at the wall that had been built five months earlier, in
                    August of 1961.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Bob Kennedy never talked to me about the State Department (as opposed to foreign
                    service officers whom he met abroad) in any systematic way, but commented
                    occasionally on his frustrations. He thought the Department inadequate to
                    meeting the challenges the president faced. He did not find it sufficiently
                    responsive to presidential guidance, and believed it had its own enduring
                    agendas. In his eyes, the State Department was an inert, sluggish bureaucracy.
                    JFK had taken to calling up desk officers for information. He thought the
                    Department accomplished so little at the top because it was constantly clearing
                    and coordinating unnecessary papers. Its pace was too slow for the Kennedys.
                    Rarely did Bob seem to make a connection between individual foreign service
                    officers he met during his travels, so many of whom impressed him favorably, and
                    the amorphous, distasteful State Department itself.</p>
                <p>Kennedy also believed the State Department was a major source of leaks to the
                    media. In fact, the president and people on the National Security Council staff
                    leaked more. He would tell me I had no idea how exasperated JFK was with State.
                    I never heard an admiring word from him about Dean Rusk. He was subconsciously
                    comparing State with his own responsive and politically attuned Department of
                    Justice. This perception of the Department was held by many on the White House
                    staff, in particular Ralph Dungan, whom I knew from our graduate school days at
                    Princeton. Ted Sorensen had strong reservations about State, as did McGeorge
                    Bundy. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. was a defender and friend, and so was Harris
                    Wofford, who developed the concept of a Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>On his return to Washington, Kennedy wrote a book about his trip, which he called
                    “Just Friends and Brave Enemies,” taking the title from a letter written by
                    Thomas Jefferson to Andrew Jackson in 1806, in which Jefferson stated, “We must
                    meet our duty and convince the world that we are just friends and brave
                    enemies.” While I was going over the galley proofs with him one afternoon in his
                    office, he took a fresh piece of paper and continued writing the
                    acknowledgments.</p>
                <p>“I wish to say a special word about Brandon Grove, Jr., of the Department of
                    State. He traveled with us and performed every task from checking the baggage to
                    advising us what we should or should not say. He was courteous and
                    understanding, spoke his views and opinions articulately, and, what is so
                    important on a trip like this, always kept his perspective and sense of humor.
                    The government is most fortunate in having his services.”</p>
                <p>6SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO MANAGEMENT UNDER SECRETARY ORRICK: 1962-63</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Attorney General Robert Kennedy's impatience with the State Department grew out
                    of his mistaken conviction that management was the problem, rather than the
                    quality of leadership provided by the secretary of state and his senior
                    advisers. This led him to the view that its effectiveness could be improved if
                    one of his personal choices were placed in the top management job. William H.
                    Orrick, Jr., of San Francisco, was an assistant attorney general heading the
                    Civil Division. He was in good standing with Kennedy because, for one thing, he
                    was reputed to have fired one of his own staff. This, and Orrick's record of
                    substantive accomplishments at Justice, convinced Kennedy that Bill was the
                    right person to take over the State Department's management brief. He would know
                    how to knock heads together and make the place respond.</p>
                <p>Orrick was appointed deputy under secretary for management to succeed Roger
                    Jones, an old line, fine civil servant whose relationship with Under Secretary
                    George Ball was not particularly strong. Bob Kennedy suggested to Orrick that he
                    recruit me to be an aide, and this is how I became Special Assistant to the
                    Deputy Under Secretary of State for Management, a numbingly bureaucratic title
                    if ever there was one. Orrick brought with him a very bright young lawyer,
                    Murray H. Bring, a Californian who had twice clerked for Chief Justice Earl
                    Warren, and worked for Bill in the Justice Department. Murray eventually became
                    vice chairman and general counsel at Philip Morris in New York.</p>
                <p>It was thus a green and inexperienced personal staff that surrounded the newly
                    arrived Orrick: Murray with no State Department background, and myself with
                    limited exposure to the Foreign Service. When I returned in 1962 from Kennedy's
                    trip around the world, Tyler Thompson, director general of the Foreign Service,
                    mockingly said: “You'll either be fired or given the embassy of your choice.”
                    Neither occurred, but I did find myself working for Bill Orrick, a man whose
                    personal qualities I admired greatly.</p>
                <p>Orrick came from an old and prominent San Francisco family of lawyers active in
                    civic affairs. He was a patron of the opera. His father, William Sr., went to
                    his law office daily, despite advanced years, and instilled in Bill a sense of
                    discipline, fairness, and a strong work ethic. Bill was 47 when he arrived at
                    the State Department, a man of seemingly boundless energy and good will who
                    always wore suspenders, loosened his tie, and rolled up his sleeves. He was
                    quick to laugh sometimes to the point of tears, penetrating and intense in his
                    questioning, and devoted to principle. Orrick's management style was boisterous,
                    open and collegial, which did not mesh well with the reserved and sometimes
                    inscrutable Dean Rusk, and the patrician, aloof lawyer from Cleary, Gottlieb in
                    New York, George Ball, who was Orrick's boss. Bill's closest friends in
                    Washington included such influential figures as McGeorge Bundy at the White
                    House, Justice Potter Stewart, and Byron White, then deputy attorney general at
                    the Justice Department. His devotion to the Kennedys was total.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Bill respected the Foreign Service, in part from association with his
                    brother-in-law, Nicholas Thatcher, a foreign service officer and Middle East
                    expert. Orrick, while living in San Francisco, also became acquainted with a
                    number of retired foreign service officers. He thus was positively disposed
                    toward the Service even before coming to the Department, and became the Kennedy
                    administration's leading proponent of our career diplomats. He was not well
                    acquainted with Dean Rusk, George Ball, or any other senior officials of the
                    Department. His relationships with Seventh Floor peers were cordial, but never
                    close. The Department's principals recognized how and why Orrick had been
                    appointed, and were initially apprehensive because none knew what his agenda or
                    instructions might be. Bill wasn't sure what they were, either. The natural
                    reaction of the Department was to close ranks, circle its wagons, and await
                    developments.</p>
                <p>I became involved in Orrick's outreach to the rest of the State Department,
                    striving also to interpret issues that came to him into language and concepts
                    with which he was more familiar, a classic special assistant function for
                    someone serving a politically appointed outsider. I also acted as a voice
                    representing the Foreign Service. Herman Pollack, the Director of Personnel, had
                    good access to Orrick and liked to keep personnel issues close to his vest; he
                    and Orrick often reached decisions in private. Orrick was satisfied with that
                    relationship and we had few difficulties in the personnel area. Ambassadorial
                    appointments were handled almost entirely by Ball, Director General Tyler
                    Thompson, and Herman Pollack; Orrick was marginally involved. Chester Bowles, as
                    under secretary, had focused on “Third World” appointments; Ball's attention was
                    centered on Europe. Secretary Rusk still signed off.</p>
                <p>The overall administration of the Department, however, remained in the hands of
                    seasoned veterans headed by William J. Crockett, the assistant secretary for
                    administration. He knew his subject. His deputies knew their areas of
                    responsibility well. Crockett had close ties to congress, particularly to
                    Congressman John Rooney of Brooklyn, chairman of the House appropriations
                    subcommittee dealing with the State Department's budget. The Rooney connection
                    was power, and Crockett always knew how to use it. Orrick was also not able to
                    relate as Crockett did to Congressman Wayne L. Hayes, of Ohio, whose committee
                    dealt with foreign assistance appropriations. This became evident early in his
                    tour, and forced Orrick to rely heavily on Crockett to do the day-to-day
                    congressional liaison and buttering-up so vital to getting money and producing
                    change.</p>
                <p>Soon after his arrival in the Department, Orrick decided to make an orientation
                    trip overseas. When he asked me for suggestions, I said: “Paris and
                    Ouagadougou.” Paris was a large, traditionally run post; Ouagadougou, in Upper
                    Volta, was a newly established mission surviving precariously in an African
                    country of scant concern to US interests. I had recently served in Abidjan when
                    that post was also responsible for Upper Volta, now Burkina, and knew what to
                    expect there. We planned about a week for the trip. The embassies' briefings
                    were effective. Orrick was particularly struck by the hardship conditions he
                    encountered in Ouagadougou.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>One morning we were talking with Ambassador Thomas Estes when the diplomatic
                    pouch from Washington arrived. To his evident satisfaction Tom took out a
                    package, unwrapped it, and withdrew an American-made inner tube. It was
                    something he could not obtain in Upper Volta for his official car. Orrick looked
                    at Estes curiously. The scene made an impression on him; he learned how remotely
                    some of our representatives lived. The inner tube became a symbol to him for the
                    reality of such clich�s about foreign service life as “sacrifice,” “dedication,”
                    and “isolation.”</p>
                <p>Orrick did not have many ideas about how to change the Department; nor, in
                    fairness, did anyone else. He recognized that the political leadership of the
                    Kennedy administration was dissatisfied with its performance, but did not know
                    where the handles were to make the needed changes. His instructions from the
                    president were vague. It is one thing to arrive with a mandate to make an
                    institution more responsive, and a different matter to devise measures to
                    achieve this elusive goal.</p>
                <p>Orrick tried to build a team and engage officials like Crockett, Director General
                    Thompson and their staffs in devising reforms. Among the latter was Thomas
                    Stern, a man of exceptional knowledge, insight, and candor who did everything
                    possible to bring Orrick and Crockett together in his loyalty to both. Orrick
                    moved Crockett up from his offices on the sixth floor to a suite adjacent to his
                    own. He moved the director general into the same suite, hoping that proximity
                    would breed cooperation. It did not. In fact, it made the work of both more
                    difficult, because it removed them from their staffs and offices that reported
                    to them. The concept was flawed and instead of increasing cooperation, led to
                    resentment and tension. Not only was this arrangement detrimental, it also
                    looked bad.</p>
                <p>Orrick did not succeed in building a vital bridge to George Ball, the
                    Department's number two. This was a precondition for success, because Rusk had
                    delegated to Ball overall responsibility for the Department's operations. As I
                    was leaving Ball's staff, Arthur Hartman, with whom I had worked as staff aide
                    there, advised me I had to do everything possible to link Orrick to Ball's
                    office. Ball had a strong interest in management and wanted to be involved.
                    Since I knew Ball's modus operandi, Hartman felt it my responsibility to bring
                    the two together. I understood the import of Hartman's comments, but could not
                    by myself develop the ties that were needed. Ball and his aide George
                    Springsteen were involved in management; they would sometimes hold meetings on
                    management issues without inviting Orrick, whose office was next to theirs.
                    Orrick correctly believed that if a management issue was important enough for
                    the under secretary's attention, the deputy under secretary for management
                    should be included in the conversation.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>It did not come as a surprise when, in mid-1963, Orrick was called to the White
                    House. President Kennedy told Orrick he wanted to reassign him to the Justice
                    Department as assistant attorney general for anti-trust matters. For those of us
                    who worked for Bill and understood his objectives, it was disappointing that he
                    was not able to put his stamp on the Department, because he had much to offer
                    it. He was aware that he had not taken charge and was becoming increasingly
                    isolated. Toward the end, he ordered lunch trays to be brought to his conference
                    room; Orrick, Bring and I ate by ourselves at the long table, realizing the game
                    was over. On the day Orrick left, I cleared out my desk in the late afternoon.
                    Bill Crockett and his staff had moved into the front office, where he was
                    pouring drinks for his friends, while I literally tip-toed out of my office,
                    taking my personal belongings to the elevator nearby.</p>
                <p>I learned from this experience—the third time in three years I had witnessed the
                    removal of a senior official. The first was Ambassador Reams in the Ivory Coast,
                    the second Under Secretary Bowles, and now Orrick. I had an exceptionally close
                    personal, as well as professional, relationship to each of them. They were
                    interested in what I thought and confided in me. I could not help feeling their
                    failures were in part mine also.</p>
                <p>I had learned about the fragile nature of political appointments, particularly
                    those at the top echelons of a bureaucracy. I understood far better the
                    importance of putting people in positions appropriate to their backgrounds,
                    personalities and strengths. Orrick tried his best, but with all of his talent
                    he was not the right man for the job. He was miscast, just as Chester Bowles,
                    for entirely different reasons, was miscast as number two at State. I understood
                    that people at the top must have support both from below and above. If they do
                    not, others quickly discern this and, smelling blood, tend either to ignore the
                    person or drive him out of office. Once the signs of weakness are perceived,
                    whether accurately or not, it is difficult to recover, even for very good
                    people.</p>
                <p>Managing the Department of State, I saw, includes effective, day-to-day
                    congressional relations. People in top management positions must build bridges
                    to congress and walk across them regularly. This was particularly true in the
                    1960s when there were powerful congressional fiefdoms, like John Rooney's and
                    Wayne Hayes', wielding great influence over the State Department's funding. I
                    find few analogies in government to corporate management. State continues to
                    live with the fallacy that if it can find a successful private sector manager,
                    someone who understands a “bottom line,” that person will replicate success in
                    the State Department. In fact, the Department has its own culture and mores, its
                    own visible and invisible power structure. In the most complicated ways, it is
                    tied to the politics of Capitol Hill. A senior manager cannot expect the
                    Department, or the Congress, to bend unquestioningly to his or her will.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Senior managers must know the bureaucracy and involve key professionals if change
                    is to occur. If a manager is unwilling to develop a vision and take time to
                    achieve consensus, he will become increasingly isolated and ineffective. State
                    will change, but only under firm and inspired leadership personally and visibly
                    supported by the secretary. Orrick brought strong political contacts, energy, a
                    first-class mind, presidential support, at least initially, and the clout of
                    someone brought in to improve the Department. Even with all of that, he made
                    little impact because he could not forge the key to fit the lock.—</p>
                <p>There is more to life than office work. Mary and I loved Georgetown and our cozy
                    home in Prospect Street. Nearby Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, in the early 60s,
                    were quieter thoroughfares, with small shops and only a few restaurants. Our
                    budget took us to Chez Odette and Martin's, rather than the tony new Rive Gauche
                    frequented by Jacqueline Kennedy and her glamorous circle. It was an
                    exhilarating time to be young and in government, where many of us believed, in
                    Robert Kennedy's phrase, we could “make a difference.” “Especially in the
                    beginning, we were electrified by the prospects of this administration,”
                    Katherine Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, recalls in her memoirs. Life
                    was good and purposeful; so many worthwhile goals seemed within reach. People
                    like my wife and I were innocents, perhaps, but I would not trade the spirit of
                    the Kennedy years for the cynicism and negativism of so much that has
                    followed.</p>
                <p>Our first child, John, or “Jack” as we have always called him, was born on March
                    4, 1963, while I worked for Bill Orrick. He would attend Maret School and St.
                    Lawrence University, and marry Hannah Hero Wood, a bright, worldly and
                    delightful British-born woman he met while running his Russian art gallery on
                    Boston's Newbury Street. Hannah was marketing director of an international news
                    publication, and more recently joined Boston's largest bank in its public
                    relations work. When the rent was raised on his gallery, Jack decided to become
                    a remodeler of homes, applying his hands and skills in design, and building his
                    own company from scratch. They now have a daughter, Evangeline.</p>
                <p>7SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO BOWLES, NEW DELHI, INDIA: 1963-65</p>
                <p>A The Ambassador's Office</p>
                <p>Chester Bowles left the under secretary of state position one month after the
                    Cuban missile crisis to assume on December 1, 1961 at President Kennedy's
                    request, the newly-created duties of Presidential Special Representative and
                    Adviser on Asia, Africa and Latin American Affairs. This was intended as little
                    more than a sinecure. Bowles soon became impatient, frustrated and sidelined.
                    The president and Rusk were not happy about the arrangement either. There had
                    been squabbles over the use of a White House car and driver. Kennedy proposed
                    that Bowles return to India as ambassador, where he had served under Truman
                    during 1951-53. Bowles had enjoyed his successful first tour in India, and so
                    had his wife Steb. Her happiness was important to Chet. They took the plunge
                    after much hesitation.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I was due for reassignment after two years in Washington and the departure of my
                    boss, Bill Orrick. Bowles asked me to join him as a special assistant. He saw my
                    task as helping him “pull things together” in the ambassador's office so he
                    could focus on his top priorities: the Nehru relationship, US military
                    assistance, India's economic development, its relations with Pakistan and China,
                    and his concerns about the growing US involvement in Vietnam. I was to be a
                    personal assistant who would help see that Bowles' wishes were accurately
                    transmitted to the bureaucracy, both in the embassy and Washington. By then
                    Bowles recognized he had not been able to communicate effectively with his own
                    government during the Kennedy administration.</p>
                <p>I had serious reservations about taking the job, and was concerned about my
                    relationship to the DCM, because some things Chet wanted me to do were what the
                    deputy to an ambassador normally did, and I feared becoming an obstacle. On Sam
                    Lewis' advice, Chet chose Joseph N. Greene, Jr. as his DCM and the two of us
                    quickly worked out an informal division of labor which did not detract from my
                    access to Bowles or Jerry's more formal responsibilities. Eventually, Greene was
                    also pulled into the inner circle around Bowles and enjoyed an excellent
                    relationship with him and Steb, as did his new wife Kitty.</p>
                <p>Our front office in New Delhi consisted of the ambassador, his two foreign
                    service secretaries who became devoted to him, DCM Greene, and three special
                    assistants: Richard Celeste, who handled Bowles' US political affairs and
                    answered Chet's voluminous Indian mail; Douglas Bennet, who concentrated on
                    economic development issues; and myself. Celeste had a background in Democratic
                    politics and later became director of the Peace Corps and governor of Ohio.
                    President Clinton would appoint him in 1997 as his ambassador to India. Bennet
                    drafted a book for Chet on economic assistance while in Delhi; he and his family
                    had known the Bowles' for a long time having lived near them in Connecticut.
                    After several jobs in government, including director of the AID program, Doug
                    became president of Wesleyan University in Connecticut. The four of us met
                    Chet's differing needs. I worked closely with the DCM, where I could be most
                    effective; Dick's and Doug's responsibilities did not impinge most of the time
                    on the embassy's operations, and therefore they were able to function more
                    independently than I.</p>
                <p>The Bowles' moved into Roosevelt House, the newly finished ambassador's
                    residence, which looks on the outside like the Kennedy Center for the Performing
                    Arts in Washington, having been designed by the same architect, Edward Durrell
                    Stone. It was not what one could easily call a home. Shoe box architecture on
                    the outside, its interior walls for the most part were a see-through
                    lattice-work of stone, recalling the Taj Mahal nearby. Sound traveled easily.
                    When Averell Harriman came to visit, Chet told me his snoring had kept Steb and
                    him awake much of the night. We subsequently referred to this bedroom as the
                    Harriman Room. Chet and Steb felt uncomfortable in Roosevelt House: it did not
                    fit the American message or the image they wanted to present to Indians.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>They decided, over vehement objections from the State Department, to move into
                    their former residence, which at the time was assigned to the DCM. The Greenes
                    moved into an even nicer house. The Bowles were happy in their old and rather
                    small home on Rattendone Road, with its lush garden. Roosevelt House became the
                    site for large-scale entertaining, and was used in creative ways for USIS public
                    affairs programs of American music, exhibits, films, and lectures.</p>
                <p>Steb took to wearing saris; she identified strongly with Indian culture. This
                    became a source of controversy, more in the American community than among
                    Indians, many of whom were flattered by her choice. Some Americans wondered
                    aloud what the wife of their ambassador intended by wearing local dress. Steb
                    simply found saris more comfortable and felt good in them. The Bowles generated
                    great interest in the Indian media. Chet was able to tap into the astonishing
                    reservoir of good will he and Steb had created in India ten years earlier.</p>
                <p>B President Kennedy's Assassination</p>
                <p>In his dealings with Washington, Bowles still found it difficult to be heard at
                    the highest levels of government. He and I returned to Washington in November,
                    1963 to make the case for increased military assistance to India. I carried our
                    memo to the president, briefing books, and supporting memos from the country
                    team. Bowles began rewriting the Kennedy memo, carefully crafted within the
                    embassy, once we had taken off from Palam Airport. Our first meeting in
                    Washington was with Robert Komer, the NSC staff member responsible for India, on
                    the morning of November 22. It went well, and an appointment with the president
                    was set for Chet the following day. I had lunch at a Georgetown restaurant with
                    Bill Orrick, Tom Stern, and other State Department friends, and returned to the
                    Department afterwards to work on our visit. In the main lobby, I learned that
                    President Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas.</p>
                <p>Much has been said about the shock and grief that followed not only in our
                    country but all over the world. Kennedy was the post-war symbol of a revitalized
                    America, a leader determined to move forward at home and abroad on the issues of
                    his day. His style, wit and elegance, his wife and children, captivated the
                    media who made him larger than life and ignored his foibles. A powerful message
                    was sent. People came to believe in him. When he died, so, once again, did
                    American innocence and a large piece of our native optimism. The lesser sides of
                    our national character have too often prevailed since then. As individuals, we
                    seem to have shorter time for being young.</p>
                <p>After the funeral procession, which I watched in the streets as I had watched
                    Franklin Roosevelt's cortege pass by as a boy, Chet and I flew back to New
                    Delhi. He had never felt close to Kennedy either personally or ideologically. At
                    a memorial service for the American community on our return, Chet spoke
                    graciously. With Lyndon Johnson in the White House, Chet thought he would fare
                    better. He did not.</p>
                <p>C Merging Political and Economic Work</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>At the Delhi embassy I worked more intimately with Bowles than I had as his
                    junior staff aide in Washington. I learned from Chet the importance of thinking
                    broadly and creatively. His idealism, courage, intellect and moral base made him
                    exciting to work for. Chet was interested in the results of work, rather than
                    the process. He urged me to think of better ways to coordinate the efforts of
                    our political and economic sections. He felt the two were not talking to each
                    other, a common complaint in the Foreign Service, and wanted integrated products
                    from both.</p>
                <p>I suggested to Jerry Greene that we consider merging the two sections. We
                    separated the responsibilities of a single new section into “internal” and
                    “external.” All officers regardless of functional expertise who worked on
                    internal matters, namely India's domestic issues and much of our bilateral
                    relationship, shared one space. Another was reserved for those working on
                    India's external relations, as with China, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, and
                    “non-aligned” nations. For the time being, we were willing to have people wear
                    their functional hats (political or economic), although we hoped eventually that
                    this difference would disappear and the Department might come to accept a new
                    career track for “political-economic” officers. Our restraint meant that the
                    integration we practiced in Delhi would not afterwards interfere with anyone's
                    career, in which advancement was based on functional specialty. Our effort was
                    to bring a different kind of intellectual discipline to reporting and
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>The not unexpected problem we ran into was acceptance of this arrangement by
                    representatives of other agencies. None of them found it reasonable to view
                    their work as we did. This was particularly true of the AID, Agriculture,
                    Treasury, and Commerce representatives, who are traditionally concerned with
                    keeping their separate identities. People in cover positions in our large CIA
                    base didn't care one way or another. Two counselor positions were established,
                    one for “Internal Affairs” and the other for “External Affairs.” The former
                    counselor for economic affairs, Leonard Weiss, became the supervisor of both
                    sections as minister-counselor for political-economic affairs.</p>
                <p>Our experiment did not last beyond Bowles' tenure for several reasons. Some of
                    the other agencies did face problems if they were to divide their work between
                    “internal” and “external.” They could also have resolved these with a bit of
                    imagination had they wanted to. Part of the resistance stemmed from the
                    personalities of people at the counselor level, who clashed about which
                    functions should be “internal” or “external.” The area of political-military
                    affairs, for example, was one that did not divide neatly.</p>
                <p>Basically, the concept did not succeed because of its uniqueness. Washington was
                    skeptical, although the Department finally went along. Foreign service officers
                    in the embassy looked forward to doing things differently; they were an
                    exceptionally competent and plucky group. Despite some very good reporting and
                    analysis, often by airgram so that the co-authors' names would be seen, people
                    eventually fell back on their old habits formed by years of experience at other
                    posts. The State Department was never supportive.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>After about a year in Delhi, the embassy's doctor recognized that Bowles showed
                    early signs of Parkinson's disease. This was known, beyond the family, only to
                    the DCM and Chet's special assistants. The disease began to prey on Bowles. He
                    lacked the vitality and vigor of his first tour. There were other problems. He
                    had lost his political base in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
                    Everyone in India who followed our domestic politics also knew Bowles had lost
                    President Kennedy's support and saw no evidence that he was closer to
                    Johnson.</p>
                <p>D The Bowles Style During Nehru and Shastri</p>
                <p>Indeed, there were some Indians who did not hide their disappointment that a
                    fallen man had been assigned to India. They recognized Bowles did not have the
                    same influence in the US government his flamboyant predecessor, John Kenneth
                    Galbraith, had enjoyed and drew invidious comparisons. Galbraith was an
                    established intellectual, a world renowned economist, a friend to President
                    Kennedy, and someone the Indians admired before his assignment. Mrs. Kennedy's
                    highly publicized visit had occurred at his urging. Galbraith had an energy, ego
                    and aloofness the Indians liked, dry wit and panache.</p>
                <p>Nehru was dying, and this affected Bowles deeply. He prized his extraordinarily
                    close relationship to Nehru in the 1950s. By 1963, Nehru was a very sick man. I
                    saw him from time to time. He was frail, vague, and not really in charge any
                    longer. Indians referred to Nehru's “dead hand” on the levers of power. The
                    government gradually became immobilized; nothing seemed to happen because Nehru
                    had to make the important decisions. He died in 1964 and was succeeded by an
                    extraordinary man, Lal Bahadur Shastri, who died early in 1966. Nehru's funeral
                    came close to evoking mass hysteria. As his body was borne to its pyre, all of
                    Delhi seemed to be in the streets in an orgy of shoving and grieving.</p>
                <p>The diminutive Shastri, a relatively unknown politician from Uttar Pradesh, was
                    his own man. Had he lived longer, he might have been able to break the Congress
                    Party's lock on government. The deaths of Nehru and Shastri made many of the
                    party's leaders increasingly set in their ways: arrogant and intent on
                    self-aggrandizement. Even then, Congress had held power too long; corruption was
                    rampant. Bowles did not know Shastri before he became prime minister. Howard
                    Schaffer, one of our political officers, did and liked him. Howie traveled
                    around India a lot and had met Shastri, who was a self-effacing and modest man.
                    It was difficult to envision him as prime minister; he seemed more in the
                    tradition of Mahatma Gandhi. I remember thinking that Nehru's passing was akin
                    to Roosevelt's death and Truman's accession. Not many knew Shastri. Who was he,
                    what would he do? His time was too short for us to know.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Bowles, the former ad man and politician, took his media relations seriously. He
                    held frequent press conferences, although the press often was not kind to him.
                    He had an excellent press attach� in Jack Stuart, who put together an organized
                    and well conceived press strategy. The communists were strong in India during
                    this period, publishing a weekly newspaper, Blitz, that was so outrageously
                    anti-US it unintentionally provided entertainment. Blitz attacked Bowles
                    personally and as a representative of the United States; it was classic yellow
                    journalism. The Vietnamese war was building up, and provided fodder for venomous
                    criticism. The Indian government ostentatiously courted the Soviets as a
                    “balance” to us, prattling about the Non-Alignment Movement, which usually was
                    anything but that, in which they relished their leadership role. We did not have
                    an easy time of it, but were helped by Bowles' eloquence and persuasiveness with
                    the responsible media.</p>
                <p>Bowles did a lot of public speaking around India and I often traveled with him.
                    When he visited our consulates, public appearances were arranged for him. His
                    favorite audience was university students, who usually received him
                    enthusiastically, although occasionally there were demonstrations against the US
                    in general, or our Vietnam policies specifically. Bowles loved the give and
                    take. He could speak movingly of America's history, beliefs, and our view of the
                    world. He did not endorse our actions in Vietnam. On a public podium, the
                    Indians had the annoying practice of introducing the guest speaker, hearing him
                    out, and then offering in the words of thanks a rebuttal of what had just been
                    said, providing the hapless speaker no opportunity for reply. Chet did not
                    always play by these rules.</p>
                <p>Relations between our ambassadors in New Delhi and Karachi were tense. They
                    communicated through cable traffic, usually sending copies of pertinent
                    reporting to each other. The Foreign Services' Walter McConaughy and Bowles did
                    not see eye to eye when it came to US policy in the region. Each supported his
                    client state. When official visitors passed through New Delhi, Bowles said to me
                    only half in jest that he was stuck with Nehru walking around in white pajamas,
                    while McConaughy could trot out Ayub Khan, who had gone to Sandhurst and mixed a
                    mean martini. Bowles thought himself unfairly matched. Relationships between
                    embassies Karachi and Delhi were good below the ambassadorial level. Both staffs
                    were professional and exchanged information and visits regularly.</p>
                <p>E Life in Delhi</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>It was never dull in our household. Mary and I had to fire our nanny Subda for
                    sleeping with the egg man, of all people, whose function it was to deliver eggs.
                    Peer pressure within the household required us to do so. Those who worked for us
                    were constantly asking for salary advances, and I soon needed a ledger to keep
                    track of these transactions. Our cook kept replacing his samplings of gin by
                    pouring water into the bottle. After all, it looks the same!Once, I offered to
                    promote one of our house boys, a bearer, to cook; he had turned out to be a
                    pretty good cook. We offered him a substantial raise, but Piara turned it down,
                    saying he had been born a bearer and would remain a bearer. His view of life
                    intrigued me. Working in our garden apartment in Malcha Marg were three
                    underemployed, unambitious, and highly self-specialized gardeners.</p>
                <p>Our daughter Catherine was born on March 21, 1964 at Holy Family Hospital in New
                    Delhi. Chet generously offered his limousine and driver for her ride home. She
                    would graduate from Connecticut College as a psychology major, and pursue her
                    passionate interest in food and cooking by attending the La Varenne school in
                    Paris, where she was first in her class. While working in Moscow on a book about
                    Russian cooking and traditions surrounding meals and holidays, she met her
                    future husband, Paul Wayne Jones, of Yorktown Heights, New York, a highly
                    regarded foreign service officer at our embassy there. The limousine ride in New
                    Delhi was to be only her first experience with government provided
                    transportation. Paul is now the DCM in Skopje, Macedonia, where they are
                    pioneering at a fairly new embassy and Paul wrestles with Balkan problems. Their
                    daughter Aleksandra is my first grandchild.</p>
                <p>Delhi, then in its 16th year of independence, was a bustling, dusty place in the
                    mid-1960s, with a strong aftertaste of the British raj. Cows freely roamed the
                    main thoroughfares. There was only one hotel used by American visitors, the huge
                    and dreadful Ashoka. Delhi was a “dry” city, and there were few good
                    restaurants, our favorite being a cramped and colorful place in Old Delhi that
                    served delicious chicken tandoori. It was not city life that attracted me to
                    India in any case, but rather the rural areas and people who worked the soil.
                    The downtrodden traditional Indian farmer and his family were people to admire
                    and respect as they lived their scrabbly lives. In India, life is lived in
                    several centuries simultaneously.</p>
                <p>The Air Force attach�'s plane was available to Bowles and he used it often. One
                    of its pilots was Colonel Paul Tibbets, Jr. an embassy attach� who had piloted
                    the “Enola Gay” over Hiroshima. He flew Chet to our constituent posts, where the
                    consuls general arranged programs that always took him into the countryside.
                    Bowles liked to meet with villagers and observe the local farms and cottage
                    industries. He was an activist ambassador, who did not enjoy the social and
                    protocol requirements of the cities. As with Robert Kennedy during the latter's
                    travels, I had to argue with Bowles to attend functions essential to his
                    standing and that of the consuls. He was more anxious to mix with the villagers,
                    with young people, with Indians he would not be meeting at the formal
                    occasions.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Riding in the car with him one day, I recalled some of my West African
                    experiences. Africans tend to be scrupulously neat in their villages. The fronts
                    of their huts are swept, often leaving pleasing designs in the traces of the
                    broom. The Indians were different; they did not seem to mind a certain amount of
                    mess, debris, and garbage. I mentioned this contrast to Chet, and it annoyed
                    him. He was offended that I would make any criticism of the Indian villager
                    whose life was so difficult and for whom he had great empathy and
                    compassion.</p>
                <p>I was struck by the contrasts between Bombay and Calcutta. The distinctions
                    themselves were testimony to the enormous size of the Indian subcontinent.
                    Bombay looked to the west, and looked western. The film industry was centered
                    there and it was India's commercial hub. I never considered Bombay particularly
                    interesting or attractive. Calcutta, on the other hand, fascinated me. One found
                    oriental influences everywhere, even in the cooking and its spicy smells. It had
                    the rhythm and bustle of a major city. So much of the human drama played out on
                    the streets, in the open air, in a way most Americans would find hard to
                    imagine. The sheer size of crowds was almost frightening. The burning ghats by
                    the river, to which the day's corpses were borne on stretchers with shouts to
                    the gods, were full of energy and sounds and colors far different from western
                    funeral rites.</p>
                <p>Despite sophisticated development assistance programs carried out by the US and
                    many other governments and organizations, including the Soviet Union, we never
                    imagined that a “green revolution” would occur in India so successfully.
                    Although AID personnel and other embassy staff worked in separate buildings, our
                    development programs were well managed under the leadership of C. Tyler Wood. If
                    there were difficulties, it was often due to a lack of coordination between the
                    embassy's economic section, the commercial and agricultural attach�s, and USAID
                    personnel. Ty Wood was one of the most influential members of Bowles' staff.
                    Douglas Ensminger, of the Ford Foundation, also played a major role in Chet's
                    analysis of India's development needs.</p>
                <p>The presidential transition in the United States in 1963 had consequences for our
                    policies in India. Johnson was becoming overwhelmed by the war in Vietnam.
                    Bowles recognized, too, that he had lost much of his access because the White
                    House staff had changed. He did not feel close to Johnson, considering him
                    crassly manipulative. Rusk remained as secretary. He knew India well, although
                    he and Bowles did not see eye-to-eye on how we should balance our relationship
                    with Pakistan. Bowles retained his idealism about what should be the nature of
                    America's relationship with developing countries and did not share the cynical
                    attitude of many American cold warriors who regarded all “non-aligned” nations
                    so disdainfully. He suffered the “hard-nosed realists” in both US
                    administrations; perhaps his vision and values look more justified today. At
                    this time also, Bowles, accustomed for years to Nehru, was learning to deal with
                    a new prime minister, Shastri, who was relatively unknown. Bowles was trying
                    simultaneously to build new relationships in Delhi and in LBJ's politically
                    changed Washington. It was never to be a very successful or satisfying
                    experience for him. Parkinson's disease, too, was beginning to take its
                    toll.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Increasingly, I felt the need to get out of staff work and into the mainstream of
                    a foreign service career. In my assignment requests of 1965, I suggested several
                    political section openings, including one in Berlin as US Liaison Officer to the
                    city government of West Berlin. Jerry Greene knew Elwood Williams III, the key
                    person on the German desk and recommended me to him. Chet understood I had a
                    career to pursue. As my successor, he chose William Dean Howells III, then
                    working on management issues at the State Department.</p>
                <p>I last saw Chester Bowles in 1984, at his large estate in Essex two years before
                    he died. Chet sat slumped in a wheelchair with a blanket covering his legs,
                    staring without expression at sailboats in the sun on the Connecticut River. He
                    seemed unaware of me, except for a fleeting moment when I shouted to him, “Chet,
                    it's Brandon!” He raised his head and shoulders almost imperceptibly at the
                    sound of my voice, I hope even today, in recognition, and then retreated
                    again.</p>
                <p>I learned much from Chet, especially about a proper place for morality in foreign
                    policy, and owe him a great debt. His interest in young people and involvement
                    of them in his life had a transforming effect on many of us. There was something
                    vital to absorb from Chester Bowles about values, well expressed in Howard
                    Schaffer's biography in which he calls Chet “the standard bearer of American
                    idealism at the height of the Cold War.”</p>
                <p>8US MISSION, WEST BERLIN: 1965-69</p>
                <p>Back in Washington after serving in India, I sought out Elwood Williams III on
                    the German desk, and we soon became soulmates. He was the State Department's
                    renowned expert on German affairs, with an encyclopedic knowledge of the US
                    relationship. Personnel assignments to policy positions required his tacit
                    approval. Rarely have I known a wiser, more thoughtful or generous man with his
                    counsel. I was among many colleagues in the “German Club” who felt privileged to
                    guide his wheelchair, to which he was confined with multiple sclerosis, into the
                    cafeteria for lunch.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1965, the State Department assigned me to the Foreign Service
                    Institute for a three month German language refresher course. The Institute was
                    still housed in the infamous Arlington Towers garage in Rosslyn. My German did
                    not come back as easily as I had hoped, because what I remembered was the
                    vocabulary, grammar, and phrasing of a nine year old boy living for a while in
                    pre-war Hamburg. In Berlin I would find myself suddenly against a linguistic
                    wall, unable to find the right German word. A child's world does not include
                    phrases like “value added tax.”</p>
                <p>A Berlin in the mid-1960s</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>In reading recently published transcripts of deliberations in the cabinet room
                    secretly taped by President Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis of October
                    1962, I am struck to see how closely everyone's assessments and decisions were
                    affected by the situation in Berlin, whose four-power status was being
                    challenged anew by Khrushchev. In a call on the president in the early stages of
                    the Cuban crisis, Foreign Minister Gromyko characterized the Western military
                    presence in Berlin as a “rotten tooth that must be pulled out.” Kennedy and his
                    advisers believed Khrushchev would move on Berlin following a US response to the
                    Soviet missiles positioned ninety miles off our shores. He did not do so, but
                    West Berlin remained a tinder box NATO feared would touch off World War III. My
                    first assignment to Berlin began a little more than two years after the Cuban
                    missile threat was defused by a calm and clear-thinking president, and four
                    years after the East Germans built their wall. Throughout, Berlin remained the
                    great diplomatic issue of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>Nearly everyone traveled to Berlin by air. Leaving Tempelhof Airport, you found
                    yourself in a unique environment ninety miles within East Germany, and were soon
                    aware of the Allied military presence and its role. West Berlin had three
                    military sectors, the US, British and French. East Berlin was the fourth,
                    legally occupied by the Soviets and distinct from the others. It was a grim city
                    in many ways, although Berliners are a resilient people. I still think of the
                    man in the street as the “Irish” of the Germans, with his good humor, fatalism,
                    and Berlin brogue.</p>
                <p>In 1965, the city bore scars of the war beyond its pock-marked buildings. One in
                    three Berliners was a woman over 45, an indication of the loss of men in the war
                    and the aging of the population. Young men from the Federal Republic, however,
                    came to Berlin to avoid military service. Below the surface, Berlin was always
                    tense. The wall separating West and East Berlin had been erected four years
                    earlier, on August 13, 1961, giving rise to frequent shooting incidents which
                    were shocking and depressing. What kind of Germans were on the other side,
                    people wondered.</p>
                <p>We lived at 54 Thielallee in Dahlem, in the American sector of Berlin, in a
                    pre-war villa whose garden of fruit trees and shrubs bordered a quiet park. Our
                    children attended the American school, and were happy there. In many ways, life
                    with a big PX and commissary was easy, yet we could not shake off feelings of
                    remoteness and menace. I have served at no post, including in the middle of
                    Africa, where people were more conscious of their isolation. We felt we lived on
                    a fortress island in the midst of a red sea, the German Democratic Republic,
                    surrounded by Soviet armed forces. There were three ways in and out: the
                    Autobahn highway, military train, and air corridors. The first was subject to
                    tight, formal Soviet—and de facto East German—control; the second and third were
                    also subject to Soviet interdiction. There was constant tension between the
                    Allies and East Germans over the Soviet role at the crossing points. The East
                    Germans attempted to control access to Berlin in efforts to create what would
                    amount to an international frontier around West Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Berlin was a place where American forces were welcome and respected, even during
                    the Vietnam War. Americans were primus inter pares among the occupying powers.
                    The Berlin airlift in 1948, Kennedy's resolve in confronting Khrushchev over
                    Cuban missiles, and countless other acts of support created a deep affection for
                    Americans. “Ich bin ein Berliner,” JFK had ungrammatically stated, and Berliners
                    loved him for saying so.</p>
                <p>The Allied commitment to Berlin guaranteed the freedom of the city's western
                    sectors and kept Soviet forces in East Berlin on their side of the wall. The
                    Allies were referred to as “occupying” powers, but in the west, beyond the three
                    aging Nazi inmates in Spandau Prison, there was no one for them to subdue. Their
                    civil role was largely symbolic, but it was no less indispensable for that. In
                    military terms, the Berlin brigades served as a trip-wire, should the Soviets
                    move their forces westward toward the Fulda Gap. West Berlin could have been
                    overrun in hours. The symbolism and trip-wire mattered, therefore, and the
                    Allied commandants held their parades and maneuvers and cultivated good
                    relations in the city with this in mind. It was widely believed, including by
                    the Soviets, that a third world war would likely start over Berlin.</p>
                <p>Berlin's legal status was thus always a concern. In 1969, for example, the West
                    German parliament decided to hold a meeting in West Berlin for the first time.
                    The Allies had serious reservations about this prospect and the Soviets were
                    opposed, claiming it inappropriate to the occupied status of West Berlin. We, in
                    turn, did not like the fact the Volkskammer, the East German parliament, met all
                    the time in East Berlin. West German legislators felt that if their eastern
                    counterparts could meet in Berlin, the West German parliament should be able to
                    do the same. To complicate matters, the Allies did not recognize any
                    competencies of the Federal Republic in Berlin. Bonn's proposal was a departure
                    from the status quo, whose maintenance was regarded by the Allies as a
                    near-sacred obligation. We were able to quash the idea, although a few
                    individual parliamentarians traveled to West Berlin and “committee meetings”
                    were tolerated. This was not the only instance in which the three Western powers
                    and the Soviets saw eye-to-eye, even if for different reasons. Each Allied
                    mission in Berlin had a legal adviser on its staff, as did their embassies in
                    Bonn, a highly unusual arrangement at foreign service posts dictated by the
                    intricacies of the legal aspects of a four-power presence in post-war Germany. I
                    served with Marten H.A. van Heuven and his successor, Arthur T. Downey. Both
                    were skilled and thoughtful lawyers and each had, in ways that differed markedly
                    in personal style, a thorough appreciation of the political context of our
                    presence in Berlin at a time when its governing mayor, Willy Brandt, was
                    developing his Ostpolitik. The smallest steps affecting Allied-Soviet relations
                    assumed legal dimensions in terms of past agreements and current
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>In the late 1960's, Rudy Dutschke led a student movement in Berlin of major
                    proportions fueled by the war in Vietnam and a narcissistic mood onihilism. A
                    similar uprising in Paris was inspired in 1968 by Daniel Cohen-Bendit, who
                    battled the police, brought on a general strike in solidarity, and indirectly
                    caused the resignation of President de Gaulle. In France, its effects were
                    compared to the revolution of 1789. It was a shock to see so many young people
                    embittered, anarchic, and feeling lost. The serious among them in Berlin felt
                    blameless for the Nazi past, alienated from the emerging “economic miracle” in
                    Chancellor Adenauer's West Germany that catered to its “bourgeois” majority, and
                    found their parents, professors and what they were learning in the social
                    sciences and humanities largely irrelevant to their times and needs. They saw
                    themselves as social revolutionaries committed to reshaping a bankrupt,
                    patriarchical and sexist order to socialist ideals. They avoided thoughts of
                    implementation, however, and concentrated instead on slogans, defamation, and
                    mob action. Today, in America as well, these ex-revolutionaries of the 1960s
                    occupy key positions in government and private life without having wrought much
                    change.</p>
                <p>There was, then, an ugly aggression to their anger, which opposed nearly every
                    aspect of the establishment and its governing institutions. Sexual freedom,
                    drugs, and an anything-goes mentality bred hatred on both sides and led to
                    public confrontations. All of this was negative and intended to destroy; the
                    mobocracy articulated no positive goals. All of this, also, was sanctimoniously
                    deplored by the East German and Soviet media as further evidence of the
                    decadence and decline of the West. Berlin witnessed almost daily student
                    demonstrations on the Kurfuerstendam that were often subdued by police and
                    powerful water cannons. Demonstrators were wounded; performances in theaters
                    interrupted; life in general disrupted. Berliners felt frustrated, angry, and
                    ashamed. How does one counter nihilism except by force, they asked themselves.
                    While the Allies were responsible, ultimately, for the safety of the city, this
                    was primarily a problem for German authorities.</p>
                <p>I remember our attending the Opera one evening in 1969 during the Shah of Iran's
                    visit to Berlin. He was hated by the students. That night, a student named Benno
                    Ohnesorg, a demonstration by-stander, was accidentally shot and killed by the
                    West Berlin police. This triggered even uglier confrontations and further
                    radicalized the student movement, which now had its martyr. Such unrest,
                    disturbing as it would have been in any city, was particularly upsetting in
                    Berlin, since Berliners were already living under Cold War tensions.</p>
                <p>One of our political officers, Kenneth C. Keller, provided a flow of brilliant
                    reporting and analysis of the unrest during this period. Ken was a quiet and
                    gentle man from Idaho, with a shaggy moustache and low-key approach, who could
                    elicit conversation from nearly anyone. He could easily pass for a Berlin
                    student, and blended into the crowd of demonstrators. Ken rivaled Berlin's
                    journalists in his depth of understanding of what was happening, and they sought
                    him out. Few in our Foreign Service had keener minds at reportage, or were
                    better writers.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Living in West Berlin, one felt oneself in a truncated city of smokeless
                    industries and suburbs, and an odd handful of main streets downtown. The
                    historic center of the city, Alexander Platz, was on the other side of the wall.
                    West Berlin had no logical center. The Kurfuerstendam, its main street of
                    elegant shops, cinemas and cafes, petered out into a dead end as it approached
                    the wastelands bordering the wall. Its architectural landmark, the Memorial
                    Church, was a bombed-out shell standing as a reminder of the devastation of
                    World War II. One had a feeling of incompletion and amputation in the city's
                    downtown streets, a depressing reminder of something absent and lost.</p>
                <p>Life under military occupation sometimes bordered on surrealism. The decades-long
                    Allied involvement in running Spandau Prison, a vast compound maintained solely
                    for three Nazi prisoners, Rudolf Hess, Albert Speer, and Baldur von Schirach,
                    was the most expensive and bizarre incarceration anywhere. Eventually, Hess was
                    alone. Allied authorities responsible for managing the prison met daily during
                    the week for a luncheon there. Allied guests, such as myself and my wife would
                    occasionally be invited to a more formal monthly luncheon. It was a form of
                    theatre noir to have a four-course lunch accompanied by French wines served in
                    the prison commandants' dining room while Rudolf Hess a few yards away read in
                    his cell, or worked in the garden. Each country tried to outdo the other in
                    hosting a great meal. The changing of the guard each month was an extraordinary
                    sight, especially when the Americans handed off to the Soviets. The first time
                    we came I thought we were on a different planet.</p>
                <p>The Allied Command Authority building located in the American sector was another
                    Berlin anomaly. Formerly a court house used in the Nazi show trials, most of its
                    nearly 500 rooms remained empty and unheated. Its grand halls were on rare
                    occasions used for the ceremonial signing of four-power agreements on Berlin.
                    The Berlin Air Safety Center for flights in the Allied air corridors was located
                    there, not to direct traffic, which was done at Tempelhof Airport, but to secure
                    a Soviet clearance for each flight. Military officers of the western Allies sat
                    at their desks, frequently passing flight information on slips of paper to their
                    Soviet counterpart for his stamp of approval. Three air corridors transited the
                    Soviet Zone of occupation and this ritual reminded everyone that the Soviets
                    controlled the air space over East Germany.</p>
                <p>Each Pan American, Air France and BOAC flight coming to or from Berlin in the
                    prescribed, tube-like corridors of 10,000 feet required Soviet approval. Other
                    air lines did not provide service to West Berlin. Occasionally, Soviet fighter
                    pilots would draw near the corridors for a look or be sent up if a plane strayed
                    out of its corridor. Sometimes these pilots came too close and the Allies
                    protested. “We could see his face!” a PanAm pilot might complain. As with the
                    administration of Spandau Prison, this function remained a daily exercise of
                    four-power occupation rights conducted with the Soviets in West Berlin. Pan
                    American's pilots announced to their passengers over West Germany that they were
                    “about to enter the Berlin corridor,” and one could feel the plane descend to
                    10,000 feet. The back of my neck always tingled at this matter-of-fact reminder
                    of the Cold War.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>There was a Berlin Document Center, which held millions of incriminating
                    documents on Nazi affiliations and Hitler's regime. The Allied Kommandatura, a
                    small empty looking building in Dahlem served as the formal meeting place for
                    the four Allied powers—who no longer met there, except for the occasional
                    Western Allies meeting. The Soviets had walked out, and their flag pole was kept
                    forever bare. Allied rituals in West Berlin had an aura of unreality at many
                    levels, but what was being done served to maintain the occupation status intact,
                    since if that was lost, the basis for Allied access to Berlin from West Germany
                    would also be lost.</p>
                <p>If the rituals seemed contrived, Berlin did not lack real life drama. One
                    afternoon, an East German attempting to escape swam across a lake and reached
                    some reeds near West Berlin's shore. He had made his flight unobserved by East
                    German patrol boats which, with their search lights, might later spot him in
                    these reeds. West Berlin police watched him through their binoculars. I learned
                    about the escape attempt in my City Hall office when it began, and about the
                    rescue arrangements Berlin authorities were making. They hid ambulances in the
                    woods near the shore, and stayed out of sight until night. It was a cloudy day
                    and the man's success in escaping would be largely decided by the weather. If it
                    rained, his chances were good; if it did not, they were lower. That evening, my
                    wife and I were scheduled to attend a social function, and I became obsessed by
                    the weather. As we left our front door to walk to the car it began to sprinkle,
                    then pour. I have never been so relieved to feel rain.</p>
                <p>There were many potential crises during the years 1965-69, incidents at the wall
                    and checkpoints, on the Autobahn, or in areas of city administration such as the
                    common sewage and subway systems between east and west. These were manageable,
                    because we carefully assessed the nature of each provocation and the required
                    Allied response, if any. A Soviet decision to escalate tensions was always
                    possible. The Soviet government was celebrating its fiftieth anniversary,
                    believing itself stable internally and a world power internationally. Its
                    constant mischief-making in Berlin was intended to wear the West out, but failed
                    to do so. The Russians historically backed down to the letter of wartime
                    agreements when confronted by strong protests. East German authorities felt less
                    committed, but we knew that eventually they would pay heed to their Soviet
                    masters and be made to comply with Soviet international obligations. When I
                    opened our embassy in East Berlin in 1974, I would come to know them better.</p>
                <p>B Brandt and Ostpolitik</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>My job in Berlin during the late 1960's was to serve as US Liaison Officer to the
                    city government of West Berlin as the representative of the US occupation
                    authorities to the governing mayor and the Berlin legislature. For much of my
                    tour, that governing mayor was Willy Brandt. The British and French had similar
                    liaison functions, also filled by their foreign services. My British colleague
                    for much of this time was Christopher Mallaby, who later became ambassador to
                    Bonn and Paris. On a 3-month rotational basis, I was the Allied spokesman at
                    city hall during the month when the American commandant became the senior
                    representative and spokesman for the three Western powers. The Western
                    representatives in Berlin worked together closely and nearly always
                    harmoniously. If there was an odd man out, it was usually the French wanting to
                    be lenient toward the Soviets. We had a local classified telegraphic system,
                    called the “Intra-Berlin” network, dedicated to exchanging information among the
                    Allies. The three missions were virtually identical in their organizational
                    structures. The US, of course, had by far the largest establishment, and in
                    political as well as military terms, we were the heavyweights in the leadership
                    role among our Allied partners, with the Soviets, and in Bonn.</p>
                <p>The US occupied an embarrasingly large office in the Rathaus Sch�neberg, West
                    Berlin's city hall on the John F. Kennedy Platz, and I was there at least part
                    of the time on an average day. I dealt with the governing mayor and his staff,
                    and monitored meetings of the Berlin House of Representatives, ostensibly to
                    insure that no laws were passed which were contrary to Allied responsibilities
                    and legal obligations. There were never any surprises. The debates, especially
                    those concerning the student demonstrations, were often lively, however. Berlin
                    has traditionally been a politically active city. The struggle for voter support
                    between the SPD, CDU, and FDP was intense, and their party conventions, attended
                    by the Western liaison officers, were informed debates of the leading issues in
                    which rhetorical skills mattered. In all of this I was helped by Frau Katharina
                    Brandt, our German employee in my office who knew everything about key people
                    and how the Rathaus functioned. She was the most professional, competent, and
                    supportive Foreign Service National with whom I have served and our country owes
                    her much. There was no other assignment in the Foreign Service comparable to
                    this one in Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The Allied liaison officers met with officials of the West Berlin government, the
                    Senat, on a daily basis. Our business ranged from protocol planning for official
                    visitors—from Jimmy Stewart to the Queen of England—to the most sensitive and
                    closely held developments in East-West negotiations. Each liaison officer also
                    had bilateral business with the chancery based on the needs of his or her
                    commandant or country. Our regular point of contact was the chief of chancery of
                    the Senat, Dietrich Spangenberg, and his successor Horst Grabert. Spangenberg
                    was the gloomy (”Things look bleak!”) pessimist and Grabert the jovial (”We'll
                    do it!”) optimist. Both were superb interlocutors, highly intelligent and
                    articulate men, strategically oriented, open, frank, engaging, and warmly
                    disposed toward us. They shared our values and emotions, and from them I learned
                    what it meant to be a post-war German on either side of the wall. The four of
                    us—the liaison officers and chancery head—became an intimate group committed to
                    each other, having dinner in rotation at each other's homes for long and relaxed
                    evening meetings, and socially close in all of our relationships within the
                    highly stratified Allied diplomatic and military communities.</p>
                <p>Our discussions were often tough, however. We pressed for details on what Brandt
                    was up to, warned of possible missteps, delivered official statements from the
                    Allies. The Germans were equally outspoken, sometimes criticizing Allied
                    timidity and inaction or, privately to me, the crossed lines of some of the more
                    visible aspects of American intelligence activities. On this last point, raising
                    an intelligence problem with me was intended to place a political light upon it;
                    there were separate channels for intelligence liaison. This give and take and
                    exchange of information, duly reported by us, formed the basis for Allied
                    comprehension of and influence upon developments in Berlin, and permitted the
                    Germans to understand our positions and constraints. These were among the most
                    exciting and productive diplomatic exchanges of my career, as Brandt progressed
                    in his Ostpolitik. They had their basis in Allied authority in the city, and
                    sometimes that authority was invoked; but they went far beyond this in tenor,
                    content, mutual respect, and openness as we dealt with the present and
                    speculated about Germany's future. What a contrast to the way the Soviets and
                    East German authorities dealt with each other across the wall, where the
                    Russians talked and the East Germans listened!</p>
                <p>I became well acquainted with Willy Brandt, the governing mayor of Berlin during
                    the first half of my tour there. While mayor, he was also national chairman of
                    the Social Democratic party, the SPD. When he was later elected chancellor, he
                    moved to Bonn and was succeeded by his deputy, Heinrich Albertz, a pastor.
                    Brandt's dual role enabled us to observe the internal workings of the SPD and
                    its evolving national leadership. We had close working relationships with senior
                    advisers around Brandt such as Egon Bahr and Klaus Schuetz. They provided
                    information and insights we reported to Washington, Bonn, and NATO, as well as
                    Allied capitals and Moscow, on Brandt's evolving East-West policies.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>During his tenure as governing mayor, Brandt developed his “small steps” of
                    rapprochement toward East Berlin's municipal authorities. He initiated meetings
                    for mid-level functionaries to discuss such matters as canal traffic and the
                    operation of the subway system, whose S-Bahn crossed into West Berlin. Although
                    these discussions were of a technical nature, they were politically important as
                    first attempts at cooperation on specific matters.</p>
                <p>No issue was more poignant than wall passes, or Passierscheine. These were issued
                    by the GDR on special occasions such as Easter and Christmas, and permitted West
                    Berliners to visit relatives on the other side of the wall for short periods.
                    They went beyond the categories of regular visits granted the elderly or for
                    certain emergencies. The issuance of wall passes was a matter for negotiation
                    among East and West Berlin authorities and the Federal government, and served as
                    something of a barometer in the relationship. It provided political leverage for
                    the GDR with Bonn and West Berlin's city hall. Heated bargaining involved large
                    payments and Interzonal Trade concessions from Bonn in cynical manipulation by
                    the GDR of humanitarian concerns for financial gain.</p>
                <p>The chief negotiator for the Senat was Gerhard Kunze, a well-built, six-foot-six,
                    ramrod straight Prussian, known for his cold-eyed stubbornness as “police club
                    Kunze.” Allied liaison officers, who appreciated his warmth and humor, and his
                    humanitarianism, were kept apprised by him of progress, step by painstaking
                    step. His well phrased, vituperative condemnations of East German counterparts
                    were a pleasure to listen to. Negotiations were protracted and fought out to the
                    last minute, nearly always with successful results heralded in the Berlin papers
                    of the West with the banner headline: “Passierscheine!” and announced across the
                    divide in a short piece at the bottom of the front page of Neues Deutschland.
                    There would soon be long lines of West Berliners at the crossing points, often
                    standing for hours in snow and cold as they clutched gifts for relatives and
                    their identification papers and prepared to pay fees, in West German marks, for
                    family reunion passes. It was a highly distasteful business.</p>
                <p>Allied policy was clear: we would not get ahead of the Bonn government in its
                    relationships with East Germany, and would take no initiatives of our own toward
                    the GDR. Relations between the Germans was thus a matter left entirely to the
                    leadership in Berlin and Bonn. We insisted, however, that our international
                    agreements with the Soviets be respected. Chancellor Kiesinger was not always
                    happy with Brandt's efforts, but did not openly restrain him.</p>
                <p>The fact that the chancellor led the CDU and Brandt the SPD played a political
                    role in this drama. It was always Brandt who took the initiative with East
                    Germany, prodding the Bonn government to follow through. Brandt realized his
                    “small steps” would become an important part of the SPD's platform in the next
                    general election. The Western Allies, meanwhile, scrambled in Berlin, Bonn, and
                    their capitals to keep pace with events. What we were hearing in Berlin from
                    Brandt and his coterie was crucial to achieving an understanding of where Brandt
                    was taking Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Brandt was also talking with the Soviets directly, meeting occasionally in East
                    Berlin with Soviet Ambassador Piotr Abrasimov. Our Berlin mission was in the
                    forefront of those who expected Brandt's “small steps” gradually to lead to a
                    wider range of topics for discussion between East and West. We were certain
                    Brandt did not intend to keep contacts between East and West Berlin limited to
                    technical levels. We saw that should he become chancellor, the pace would
                    accelerate. His motive in Ostpolitik was to achieve a more healthy and human
                    relationship among Germans, even at the cost of accepting two German states. He
                    was not a panderer or accommodator toward the East. Yet Brandt's moves at times
                    caused suspicion in Western capitals as to whether he might trade West Germany's
                    western orientation for reunification.</p>
                <p>Brandt's chief counselor on openings to the East was Egon Bahr, a dour, even
                    furtive man who kept his own counsel. I wonder whether anyone on the Allied side
                    was ever fully apprised of Brandt's activities; the risks of “telling all” were
                    high in such a fragile process. Brandt never went beyond the formal limits the
                    Western powers had imposed, which were based upon their responsibilities as
                    occupying powers. He stayed within the framework we had established with great
                    skill, yet subtly forcing the Western powers to re-examine and gradually expand
                    their parameters of accommodation. Such was his Ostpolitik.</p>
                <p>Brandt was a dynamic, gravel-voiced and powerful speaker with great charisma, as
                    I saw when I attended Berlin SPD party conferences. He was a rugged, sturdy,
                    earthy individual who was popular because ordinary people identified with him
                    and thought him sincere; he came across as tough and dependable. Brandt was also
                    a warm man, attractive to women, yet given to frequent bouts of depression.
                    Often tormented and brooding, he had a fierce temper. He drank a lot, favoring
                    brandy, Branntwein in German, as cartoonists liked to point out. I saw him on
                    many occasions when he was suffering from a hangover. I would bring
                    distinguished visitors, or our ambassador in Bonn, to his office, and
                    occasionally Brandt would sit in a funk and say nothing. I warned people before
                    their meetings of his moodiness, and that they might find long lapses in
                    conversation. Even under the best of circumstances, he was privately a man of
                    few words.</p>
                <p>Brandt had an extraordinarily complicated personality, and a troubled marriage to
                    a strong and patient woman named Rut. My acquaintance with Willy Brandt enriched
                    my appreciation of what one person with a driving sense of purpose can
                    accomplish. I have seldom dealt with a man of so many facets, and such boundless
                    political, physical and intellectual energy. He was a visionary who led Germany
                    to its reunification, beginning with the necessary first small steps in
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>C The US Mission</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>The US Mission was housed in the cavernous military headquarters, formerly
                    Goering's, in Dahlem's Clayallee, where the senior American was the US
                    commandant, an Army major general. The US minister, always a foreign service
                    officer, served as deputy commandant. The fact that the most senior Allied
                    officials in Berlin were highly visible military men who wore their uniforms on
                    duty underscored the fact that Berlin was an occupied city whose status remained
                    unresolved following the Allied victory in World War II. My nearly four years in
                    the Navy at the end of the Korean War taught me about the military mind: its
                    planning capabilities, precision, discipline, emphasis on training, and pride in
                    service. I knew the jargon and understood the need for hierarchy. Throughout my
                    career, I found military experience invaluable. Those in uniform seemed to
                    recognize that I bore none of the innate suspicion and lack of understanding
                    that can make civilian cooperation with the military an uncomfortable, even
                    unsuccessful, process.</p>
                <p>During my tour from 1965-69, I worked for two foreign service ministers, John
                    “Arch” Calhoun and Brewster Morris. They had entirely different styles, and one
                    could learn about civilian-military relationships by observing them. Arch
                    Calhoun was masterful in handling the military, sensitive to the policy
                    responsibilities of the US commandant, and adept at anticipating his needs and
                    concerns. Arch took the initiative in bringing matters to the military, along
                    with his proposals for handling them. Brewster Morris, his successor, was not as
                    skilled in this partnership. He too enjoyed good personal relations with the
                    commandant, but was excessively deferential, more likely to seek guidance from
                    the military than to come into a room with his own draft telegram.</p>
                <p>There were, as I recall, some sixteen American intelligence entities, most of
                    them military, in West Berlin, yet they missed plans to build the wall. Reliable
                    intelligence was critical. Oddly enough, given the importance of Berlin to the
                    west, the other Allied services were not much better. There were many
                    difficulties built into the conduct of human intelligence functions in Berlin in
                    the mid-sixties. Not only were the Soviets and East Germans formidable
                    opponents, there were problems of process as well. Foremost among these on the
                    US side, in my view, were overstaffing and lack of coordinated priorities and
                    gathering methods; compartmentalization of effort and product among services;
                    absence of centralized screening for duplication and reliability; destructive
                    competition among services; and lack of responsible analysis in many cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>No one seemed in charge, civilian-military rivalry was intense, and agents
                    collided with each other in a great scramble to report something. One had the
                    impression many were operating under a quota system based on the number of
                    reports they could send off. Intelligence operatives tried to co-opt open
                    sources, among them people I knew at city hall. This was stopped when we learned
                    of it. Protective cover for these large enterprises was usually poor. Many
                    agents and safe houses were known to the opposite side and our German employees.
                    I do not recall learning from intelligence reports anything startling or
                    particularly worthwhile, from my standpoint, during four years in West Berlin.
                    In fairness, I should add that I was at the margins of what was going on in the
                    intelligence world.</p>
                <p>D East Berlin</p>
                <p>I had occasions to visit East Berlin never realizing, of course, that I would one
                    day open our embassy there. At the Checkpoint Charlie barriers we lowered our
                    car windows a crack to show passports and be able to hear the East German guard.
                    “Charlie” was simply the military communications term for the third letter of
                    the alphabet—this was US military crossing point “C.” Following Allied
                    instructions, we did not permit border guards to handle our passports, much less
                    take possession of them. We showed the passport cover and the page on which a
                    photo was displayed, then proceeded through the checkpoint. In case of a
                    problem, we demanded to speak to a Soviet officer, who normally remained out of
                    sight. It was a tense experience because you could never know whether the other
                    side wanted to provoke an incident.</p>
                <p>The rationale for these procedures, which were uniformly observed by the Western
                    Allies, went to the heart of the legal status of all of Berlin as occupied
                    territory. We were prepared to deal with Soviet military authorities on
                    questions pertaining to the four sectors of Berlin, but refused to discuss these
                    matters with East German officials of any stripe because we did not recognize
                    their authority in the Soviet sector of Berlin. That is why, in any difficulty
                    at the checkpoint, we summoned a Soviet military officer as the appropriate
                    discussion partner. We tested Allied rights continuously, in the belief that a
                    right not exercised soon ceases to be a right. A separate political/economic
                    section of the US mission in West Berlin was devoted to East German and Soviet
                    affairs, and these FSOs traveled to East Berlin regularly to visit their Soviet
                    and rare East German contacts. The rest of us went not only out of curiosity and
                    to maintain the right of passage, but also to remind ourselves that despite the
                    isolation of living in West Berlin, another part of the city was far worse
                    off.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>East Berlin in the mid-1960s was a stark, shabby, down-at-the-heels place with
                    shop fronts decorated for show and sparsely stocked food stores. Scars of
                    destruction from World War II were everywhere, and formed a pathetic landscape
                    alongside the hideous Soviet-style blocks of cheaply constructed high-rise
                    apartment buildings whose concrete facades were already deteriorating. The acrid
                    smell of low octane gasoline, brown coal and strong cigarettes permeated hotels,
                    restaurants and shops. Pedestrians avoided one's gaze. The contrast to West
                    Berlin was riveting. The authorities were communists and often Prussians to
                    boot, a deadly combination that made them seem even more dour and hostile than
                    the Soviets. We were not permitted to visit East Germany, other than to travel
                    on the Autobahn to West Germany.</p>
                <p>Reunification of Germany seemed a fading prospect, and was mentioned less
                    frequently in the West. The Allied powers had settled in for the long haul. West
                    Berliners accepted the comforts of their lives and made the most of tightly
                    controlled opportunities through wall passes to visit their relatives on the
                    other side, who were stoic about their fate. The division seemed nearly
                    complete, except for the knowledge that Brandt was making slow progress with his
                    “small steps” toward normalization with the East.</p>

                <p>Our son Paul was born on May 17, 1965 shortly before we left Washington for
                    Berlin. He would later attend Bates College, where he met his future wife,
                    Martha Merselis, of Williamstown, Massachusetts. A lovely, lively and caring
                    woman, she is a professional archivist, with a graduate degree in her field from
                    George Washington University. They lived for two years in Cambodia, where Paul
                    directed the International Republican Institute's office and Martha was in
                    charge of women's programs, and have retained a strong interest in Southeast
                    Asia. Their son, Samuel, bears an old family name.</p>
                <p>E Assassinations of King and Robert Kennedy</p>
                <p>There are two terrible events I sadly recall from my tour in West Berlin. The
                    first was the murder in Memphis of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968
                    at the age of 39. Klaus Schuetz had succeeded the former pastor Albertz as
                    governing mayor of West Berlin. Schuetz, at the height of the disruptive student
                    demonstrations that plagued the city, decided to lead a march of his own to
                    memorialize King. The point he made beyond Berliner's affection and admiration
                    for King, was that not all demonstrations are displays of negative, angry
                    protests; they can be held with dignity to express positive feelings.</p>
                <p>US Minister Brewster Morris, Schuetz and I were in the front rank of this march
                    honoring Martin Luther King's memory. I had never before been on the streets as
                    a demonstrator, and was moved by the expressions of esteem Berliners showed
                    toward King and the American struggle for civil rights. The march went off
                    smoothly. The crowds were not large, but made a counter-statement about the
                    positive potential of demonstrations.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>On one of my return visits to the State Department from Berlin, in the autumn of
                    1967, Robert Kennedy invited me to Hickory Hill for dinner with Ethel and the
                    football hero Roosevelt Grier. After the meal we sat in his study that fall
                    evening and our conversation turned to politics. Bob was wondering whether to
                    run for president, hesitating to get into an ugly fray and far from confident
                    that even the nomination could be his. It was a discussion he must have had many
                    times before. He was a man undecided about what to do and dispirited by the
                    choices. Johnson, whom he had never liked, was president and would probably run
                    again. The primary campaign would be divisive and difficult. He thought the
                    country had been torn apart by Vietnam, civil rights issues, and young people
                    feeling themselves alienated from the rest of society.</p>
                <p>Bob believed we were bogged down in the White House and in Congress where, as a
                    senator, he said he often felt frustrated and bored. You can't get anything done
                    there, he told us. He believed he could make a difference in the campaign and as
                    president, but still he hesitated. Rosie and I urged him to try to make that
                    difference. Ethel was noncommittal but I sensed she agreed with us. That
                    evening, we seemed to be overwhelmed by our country's problems and the political
                    choices available. On March 16, 1968 Kennedy declared his candidacy and barely
                    two weeks later, on March 31, Johnson announced at the end of a television
                    address on Vietnam that he would not seek another term as president.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>I was in Berlin when Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles on June 5,
                    1968 at the age of 42. It was almost impossible to explain why this had
                    happened. Berliners blamed a deep streak of violence in American society. People
                    felt there was something wild and ungovernable in the American psyche, a bad
                    strain in our national character. West Berliners, when Robert Kennedy was
                    killed, placed lighted candles in their windows, which they did only on deeply
                    felt occasions such as November 22, 1963 when his brother, our president, was
                    gunned down.</p>
                <p>I returned to the US for the funeral at the invitation of the Kennedy family, and
                    was asked to be an honorary pallbearer at the ceremonies in St. Patrick's
                    Cathedral in New York. When the pallbearers were lined up alphabetically so we
                    could enter the church as a group, I found myself standing next to Rosie Grier,
                    the football star with whom I had dinner at Hickory Hill the last time I saw Bob
                    and Ethel and we talked about Bob's tough political choices. Now, there was
                    nothing to say. Afterwards, I joined the family and cortege on the train back to
                    Washington, and at the burial in Arlington Cemetery where Mrs. Kennedy insisted
                    there be no rifle salute.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The weather was hot on June 8. Standing by the casket in the cathedral when my
                    turn came, I felt myself to be somewhere beyond reason and reality. The train
                    ride to Washington remains my most vivid memory of that day. When we came out of
                    the tunnel into New Jersey and moved slowly down the tracks toward Washington, a
                    routine trip made so often in other circumstances, we were astonished to see
                    people standing all along the roadbed: men from veteran's posts wearing their
                    overseas caps and saluting; families with children lifted up; people holding
                    flags or waving slowly as we went by. I saw the body of a man near the Elizabeth
                    platform who had just been sliced in half by an oncoming train. The platform was
                    so jammed that in a surge he had fallen off. All traffic in the opposite
                    direction was stopped and our train proceeded on a clear track to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>The further south we went the more Afro-Americans were in the crowds, and the
                    crowds grew larger. In Baltimore, as we crawled through the station, people sang
                    the “Battle Hymn of the Republic.” It was hard to keep emotions in check. The
                    train became a capsule in which we were the spectators, looking out at these
                    enormous numbers of people, hour after hour, who had come to watch us pass and
                    pay their respects. I sat first with Kennedy's secretary, Angella Novello, and
                    then with Claiborne Pell. We were hot and worn out and didn't speak much,
                    surrendering ourselves to the incredible scene along the tracks. My mind often
                    flashes back to that day when I ride the train, especially heading south from
                    New York to Washington.</p>
                <p>There was a place, somewhere in Robert Kennedy's inmost self, to which he
                    withdrew when he thought or listened intently. From this quiet and very personal
                    place came his deepest feelings and convictions; it was the source of strength
                    required for daring, even noble, commitment and action. He was a man who quoted
                    Aeschylus from memory. At his core was his Catholic belief and room for pain,
                    self-doubt, resolve and ultimately, a tragic sense of life. When he was there,
                    people noticed that his hooded eyes lost focus and stared ahead, while his voice
                    became soft. During such moments, one could almost see him coming to a decision
                    and, sensing his vulnerability in this intensely private process, kept silent.
                    His acquiescence in responsibilities thrust upon him that he passionately
                    believed he must meet drove him to the edges of endurance, as few others are
                    driven by an awareness of public purpose in their lives.</p>
                <p>To people of my generation, in particular, who believed with the Kennedys that
                    government could do good, the shock was devastating. Part of our world ended and
                    never reassembled itself the same way. I had thought when Lyndon Johnson
                    announced he would not seek the presidency because of the course of the war in
                    Vietnam, Bob Kennedy had a good chance to succeed him. I now wonder whether he
                    would have found enough support in our southern states.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>On my way from Berlin to New York for the funeral, I stopped in London, where I
                    stayed with my father in Knightsbridge and walked through Hyde Park to our
                    embassy in the warm evening air. I stood in line in Grosvenor Square to sign the
                    condolences book. When it came my turn, I read what the young woman in front of
                    me had written. She asked: “Why do you Americans always kill the best in
                    you?”</p>
                <p>DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF PANAMANIAN AFFAIRS: 1969-71</p>
                <p>A Reassignment to Washington</p>
                <p>The executive director of the Bureau of American Republics Affairs (ARA), Findley
                    Burns, called me in Berlin. I met this urbane Baltimorean with a dry sense of
                    humor when he was in charge of administering our London embassy, and have
                    encountered few others who understood bureaucratic politics better. Findley's
                    job was to manage the bureau's resources, including personnel. Charles A. Meyer,
                    the assistant secretary, had been newly appointed by the incoming Nixon
                    administration. Charlie had previously been a Sears, Roebuck executive, and
                    wanted fresh blood in his bureau. Cheerful and a dapper man, his talents were in
                    management.</p>
                <p>The State Department had decided to make its country director positions pivotal
                    in bilateral relations. Country directors usually supervise clusters of desk
                    officers, who deal with individual countries in larger regional groupings, such
                    as the offices of Andean, or Central America affairs. Three or four of us,
                    without previous experience in Latin America, were asked whether we would be
                    interested in becoming country directors in ARA. Findley wanted me to be
                    Coordinator for Cuban Affairs and I readily agreed, believing my Berlin
                    experience might help.</p>
                <p>By the time I returned to Washington, however, a decision was made to manage
                    Cuban Affairs through Robert A. Hurwitch, a deputy assistant secretary in ARA.
                    The Panama directorate opened up in the meantime and was offered to me. This
                    assignment brought me to a new continent, the fourth in four assignments. I
                    probably should have been concerned by my lack of a home bureau and regional
                    specialization, which are important in the politics of the Department's
                    assignment process, but was either too new or unaware to care. I welcomed this
                    opportunity to learn about another part of the world. Given the same choice, I
                    would again opt for wide-ranging geographic assignments. My regret is that I
                    never served in the Asian bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I soon found that experiences in different parts of the globe become applicable
                    to those of others. Our concerns in Africa were not unrelated to our policies in
                    Latin America; what we did in New Delhi was not divorced from our efforts in
                    Berlin. I was beginning to acquire a global view, which raised questions in my
                    thoughts that were sometimes more theoretical than immediate, but were
                    nevertheless relevant to broadly based objectives of the US. What mattered were
                    the interests themselves, and our specific reasons for involving the United
                    States and committing its resources to particular programs and places. This made
                    the definition of interests a vital task. During two later assignments on the
                    Policy Planning Staff, I learned how frustrating that definitional process can
                    become in a foreign affairs bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Cold War, our policies were usually shaped, in the first instance,
                    by what the Soviets were doing and our perceptions of their motives. This was
                    particularly the case in developing countries, where our interests beyond raw
                    materials, “containment,” and strategic positioning were often modest.
                    Convenience and reactive policy and resource planning permitted “the Soviet
                    threat” to become most of the argument needed for congressional support of
                    massive programs, especially in military assistance, in places like Somalia
                    where the deadly consequences of an arms race would haunt us years later. The
                    Soviet threat was real, of course, but there should have been more discussion
                    about how it would play itself out, for example, in Mogadishu.</p>
                <p>The perception of Soviet threat, and to a lesser degree strategic concerns about
                    Maoist China and North Korea, across the Pacific Ocean, were important elements
                    in our relations with Panama in the late 1960s as we prepared to renegotiate the
                    canal treaty. In our dealings with Panama, moreover, Castro's Soviet-supported
                    regime in Cuba was an emotionally charged ingredient, particularly after the
                    missile crisis of October, 1962. Panama's quixotic new leader, General Omar
                    Torrijos Herrera, was a question mark in American minds.</p>
                <p>B The Bureau of Inter-American Affairs</p>
                <p>I came to my assignment as country director for Panama in 1969 after four years
                    in Berlin, a city at the core of East-West tensions, and therefore had
                    first-hand diplomatic experience of the Cold War. The country directorates were
                    at their strongest then, having since been weakened by a plethora of deputy
                    assistant secretary positions, one layer above, in the regional bureaus.
                    Beginning in the mid-1960s, Dean Rusk intended the directorates to become
                    executive branch focal points for the conduct of our foreign relations. They
                    were the natural addresses for foreign ambassadors in Washington and our chiefs
                    of missions abroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Most of what I knew about Panama I learned in the Navy, while serving in the
                    Caribbean during 1954-56. I understood the strategic importance of the canal,
                    and was familiar with the movements of ships, their dimensions and
                    characteristics, how the canal worked, and what a two-ocean fleet was about. But
                    the political aspects of US-Panamanian relations were new to me. I knew no one
                    in the ARA bureau except Findley Burns. Initially, we newcomers to the bureau
                    were viewed with suspicion by our peers, especially the “Latin Club,” in which
                    those with depth in the lore of Panama fancied themselves “Panamaniacs.” The
                    assignment process, controlled by the geographic bureaus until the mid-1970s
                    when it became centralized under the director general for personnel, kept Latin
                    American experts locked into the Hemisphere, as EUR and other bureaus protected
                    their coveted senior slots. Charlie Meyer wanted to open this circle, fully
                    supported by career officers Hurwitch and John H. Crimmins, his deputies and
                    veterans of Latin American service. Hurwitch and I had an excellent relationship
                    from the outset: he was aggressive, hard-boiled and intellectually disciplined,
                    qualities I admired.</p>
                <p>ARA was the only bureau that integrated its assistance programs with foreign
                    service political and economic staffs, in back-to-back arrangements which
                    co-located State and Alliance for Progress people in the same offices. My deputy
                    for Panamanian affairs, Leonard Horwitz, was the senior aid officer for Panama.
                    There were also country directorships headed by an aid officer, with a foreign
                    service officer as deputy. This arrangement worked well, a policy model ahead of
                    its time.</p>
                <p>Our office was not large, some six or seven people including the deputy, myself,
                    and two secretaries. Martha Hayward, one of the most professional and talented
                    secretaries in our service whom I had met in Berlin, agreed to join me. FSO
                    Kenneth Bleakley was our economic officer, Edwin Corr the political officer.
                    They became part of a close team including the development assistance officers.
                    We viewed our policy and operational concerns in Panama—whether political,
                    treaty related, economic, or developmental—as part of an integrated whole. This
                    strengthened my belief, tested in India, that the Foreign Service is more
                    effective when it makes political and economic work a coordinated effort, not
                    separate spheres to be dealt with on their own merits and within their own
                    confines.</p>
                <p>I also found that when economic assistance people are part of your team, you have
                    a much better understanding of what they are trying to achieve. Developmental
                    assistance issues of any magnitude came to me before they went to the assistant
                    secretary and the assistant administrator for aid. I knew what our aid programs
                    were, and had a strong voice in shaping, administering, and supporting them. We
                    wrestled with criteria for starting and continuing assistance programs;
                    conditions necessary for carrying out a successful program; the right mix;
                    constraints on the US in engaging in development assistance; the essential role
                    of private voluntary organizations; and support from the international donor
                    community.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Like other country directors in ARA at the time, I involved myself in the
                    selection of the aid program director when a new person was needed in Panama. I
                    doubt this was welcomed by everyone on the assistance side, but believed doing
                    so came with my authority and responsibilities. In the final analysis, this was
                    also helpful to the new aid director in Panama because he knew he could count on
                    support from the entire country directorate in Washington.</p>
                <p>The ARA model made it possible to shape US developmental efforts to serve our
                    longer term political objectives. There are occasional tensions in merging
                    development and political goals that are inescapable no matter how one is
                    organized. Aid programs are not intended as political chips. But the assistance
                    people have their own agendas, too, which at times reflect strong political
                    preferences on their part. When they stray from responsibilities of providing
                    assistance and training to supporting individual ministers in a government, or
                    sometimes the leader at the top, they are outside their duties and can cause
                    embarrassment and problems for those in the embassy accountable for political
                    relations.</p>
                <p>I was assigned three objectives.</p>
                <p>The first was to manage, on a day-to-day basis, our efforts to change the treaty
                    relationship with Panama. In 1967, negotiations to revise the Panama Canal
                    Treaty of 1903 had reached deadlock. By the time I took over Panamanian affairs
                    that year President Nixon decided to renew negotiations to bring the treaty into
                    conformance with the realities of the day and our evolving national security
                    interests. The painstaking work of developing a negotiating strategy, writing
                    position papers, coordinating with other interested agencies, fell to us.</p>
                <p>At times, the demands were nearly overwhelming. There were many agencies with a
                    deep interest and stake in the negotiations, none greater than the Department of
                    the Army, represented by Colonel John P. Sheffey, an ardent, loud-voiced
                    defender of Defense Department views and unrivaled expert on canal matters until
                    Colonel Richard Wyrough succeeded him, and eventually me. John Irwin, then under
                    secretary of state, had been the leading US negotiator from 1964-67. He had an
                    abiding interest in the issue. The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs was
                    heavily involved. Mark Feldman practically cohabitated with us as legal advisor.
                    But the Office of Panamanian Affairs was the coordinating office throughout
                    preparations for the negotiations which resumed in a serious fashion in
                    1975.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Our second objective was to understand what General Omar Torrijos was all about.
                    He had come to power earlier in 1969 and was still an unknown quantity in
                    Washington outside intelligence circles. He had been, and remained, an officer
                    in the Panamanian National Guard. Robert M. Sayre, our ambassador to Panama, had
                    also recently arrived at his post. His instruction from Meyer was to get along
                    with Torrijos and his government. We needed to determine what kind of a person
                    Torrijos was, and whether we could have a fruitful relationship with him,
                    particularly on the issue of treaty renegotiation. Could we trust him? Our
                    primary objective in Panama was internal stability to insure the continuing
                    smooth operation and security of the canal. Renegotiation was our next goal, but
                    stability was the more important one.</p>
                <p>My third objective was to represent the Department of State on the Inter-Oceanic
                    Canal Study Commission. This group, under the chairmanship of Dr. Milton
                    Eisenhower, included former Treasury Secretary Robert Anderson and other
                    luminaries. The Commission was charged with studying the merits of building a
                    sea-level canal between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and examining the
                    feasibility of a third set of locks for the existing canal. The site might be
                    Panama, Colombia, or Nicaragua. The study was driven by the prospect that the
                    locks in the Panama Canal would eventually wear out, making the canal either
                    inoperable or more expensive to maintain. Traffic through the canal was
                    increasing, but some of our aircraft carriers already had beams too wide for
                    canal passage. Our two-ocean fleet was becoming two separate entities. The same
                    was true for supertankers, which also rendered the canal a bit less vital as a
                    choke point.</p>
                <p>One solution to these problems could be construction of a sea-level canal to
                    provide an open and navigable link between the two oceans, unrestricted by
                    vulnerable locks. Questions for study included feasibility, location, costs,
                    methods of excavation (including nuclear), and environmental concerns. The
                    Japanese government was particularly interested because of its dependence on
                    shipping, available financial and technological resources, and the prospect of
                    wielding influence over an inter-oceanic sea lane. One of the reasons we were
                    considering an alternative canal was that it would avoid the prospect of further
                    riots in Panama and other perceived threats to the existing locks. In 1970, the
                    Commission published its conclusion that a third set of locks or a sea-level
                    canal were economically unfeasible, given costs and future shipping projections,
                    and concerns that predators in the Pacific would destroy sea life in the
                    Caribbean. The increasing use by trucks of a land bridge across the US was also
                    a factor. Of the possible locations for a sea-level canal, two sites in Panama
                    emerged as the preferred routes. It is doubtful that constructing a sea-level
                    canal will again become a serious prospect, for reasons of cost and demand.</p>
                <p>C Resuming Canal Negotiations</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>There are at least seven countries with which the United States has unique and
                    “special” relations: Panama, Cuba, The Bahamas, Mexico, Canada, Israel, and
                    Ireland. Five are near neighbors. The common denominator is the high degree of
                    domestic political and economic concern in the US that influences our foreign
                    policies toward each. Yet each bilateral relationship is unique, not only
                    because of domestic constituencies, but also because the issues are very
                    different. The way these relationships are managed in Washington presents
                    obstacles and opportunities. In Panama, moreover, we had the “Zonians,” a large
                    and permanent community of expatriate Americans running the canal and living,
                    thanks to our government, under a nearly perfect form of cradle-to-grave
                    socialism. They enjoyed strong support in the US Congress.</p>
                <p>The congressional dimension was always a major factor in our deliberations about
                    treaty relationships. Many in congress believed the Canal Zone to be American
                    soil, as inviolable as, say, Texas. No change in the status quo was warranted or
                    acceptable, in this view. Military constituencies held equally strong opinions.
                    There was broadly based national sentiment about the canal and support for the
                    1903 treaty amounting to patriotic fervor. When the new treaties were eventually
                    submitted for ratification by the Carter administration in 1977, they inspired
                    the most emotionally charged debate in our foreign policy of the post-war
                    years.</p>
                <p>The canal issue brought us especially close to the House Merchant Marine and
                    Fisheries Committee, whose tough but competent chairman was Congresswoman
                    Leonore Sullivan. We regularly briefed the staffs of that committee, and the
                    House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees. People in
                    congress wanted to know what was going on and to provide advice or condemnation.
                    I recalled my days on the Hill with Chester Bowles ten years earlier, while
                    waiting to enter the Foreign Service, which helped me understand their concerns.
                    Congress was the primary constituency we needed to satisfy—and eventually,
                    thanks in large measure to Senate majority leader Howard Baker, we did. The
                    Nixon White House had a global foreign policy agenda, and never waivered in its
                    decision to proceed with canal negotiations, politically charged though these
                    were. As with the opening to China, President Nixon was not lacking in political
                    courage in foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>It is useful to observe the bureaucratic decision-making process in this matter,
                    and the national security system Dr. Henry Kissinger imposed on the executive
                    branch. The basic unit of this system was the Interdepartmental Group, normally
                    one “IG” for each regional bureau. ARA had an advantage in this new system in
                    that it had already integrated Latin American aid programs into the broad
                    framework of our bilateral relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The national security structure Kissinger devised was immensely time consuming,
                    and intended to be so. We were tasked by the NSC to undertake study after study
                    and produce great quantities of option papers. Viron “Pete” Vaky was the senior
                    NSC staffer for Latin America, assisted by Arnold Nachmanoff. Vaky, an ever calm
                    Foreign Service officer, was indispensable to us during this period. At times
                    when the NSC's demands drove us into the ground, he helped keep our priorities
                    straight. The system had its strong point in demanding an interagency focus.
                    When this system worked it brought the right people together, and kept them
                    informed and locked in on key issues, options, priorities, and resource
                    requirements. The flip side was that committee products are often fatuous,
                    watered-down compromises. We were able to deflect some of the interagency turf
                    wars and back-stabbings that come into play when the US government is faced with
                    tough policy choices. Pete Vaky, Winston Lord, and others around Kissinger
                    forced the bureaucracy to come up with work of high quality that brought out the
                    best in the State Department, a feat duplicated only by George Shultz.</p>
                <p>Kissinger took an interest in the Panama negotiations, in part because he knew
                    Nixon was engaged and also because he relished the intricacies of any major
                    negotiation. This was one of the rare instances when Kissinger delved into Latin
                    American issues. He was by nature Eurocentric, and much of his time was
                    necessarily devoted to the Vietnamese War and its ramifications. Within the
                    State Department, John Irwin, the deputy secretary, was highly supportive, which
                    was a great help. Because of Irwin's previous negotiating efforts, he had
                    detailed knowledge of canal issues; he knew the real estate we were discussing,
                    military considerations, and canal operations themselves. We resumed
                    negotiations in 1969 with a rich database and an inheritance of political and
                    emotional issues that would take many years to be resolved.</p>
                <p>We believed the existing treaty was rapidly becoming an anachronism and that our
                    vital interests in Panama could be better served by new arrangements. We also
                    thought we could successfully renegotiate the 1903 treaty and secure its
                    ratification. We found ourselves reconsidering the magical words “in perpetuity”
                    which described the duration of US rights in the 1903 document. Actually, with
                    ratification of the new treaties, “perpetuity” came to be redefined in 1979 as
                    76 years, about the lifespan of the average American male. The US was
                    increasingly criticized by other Latin countries for acting as a colonial power.
                    Panama, in turn, was derided as a puppet of the US, a non-country devoid of
                    sovereignty and even dignity. The US-Panamanian relationship seemed outdated to
                    most of the rest of the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>The State Department, with White House support, was the driving force for
                    renegotiation. We wanted to pre-empt the possibility of a break-down in
                    relationships which would have made our position in Panama more difficult. We
                    wanted to modernize treaty arrangements while it was still possible to do so
                    without being compelled to act by an emergency such as riots. In congress, we
                    had latent support for our position. As often happens, however, the opponents of
                    change, many of them key members, were better organized, more obstreperous and
                    very vocal. Negative aspects of change received greater public attention than
                    positive ones, and for a long time carried the day in the popular view.</p>
                <p>Robert Anderson, who succeeded Irwin as US negotiator, operated out of his
                    investment banking office in New York. I worked closely with him on the
                    negotiations. He relied on us to staff him and left us pretty much alone
                    otherwise, except on matters likely to become political issues and involve the
                    NSC, the president, or both. Anderson was a Texan with a courtly manner. He was
                    a wheeler-dealer, forever murmuring into a telephone. He had been secretary of
                    the Treasury and widely mentioned as a potential Republican presidential
                    candidate at the end of the Eisenhower administration. Many say he was
                    Eisenhower's choice. But his interest in the negotiations was, in fact,
                    sporadic; as we learned later, his business practices were often convoluted. He
                    ran into legal difficulties towards the end of his life and, sadly, was
                    sentenced to prison for a brief period.</p>
                <p>Anderson brought the approaches of both a politician and businessman to a complex
                    foreign policy issue. He was skilled in dealing with the Pentagon and CIA, both
                    crucial players, something in which an aggressive Colonel Sheffey helped him
                    immensely. These agencies trusted him more than the State Department did, where
                    he was considered something of a loose cannon on the gun deck. Anderson was a
                    natural negotiator from whom I learned much. He did not use anyone from his firm
                    or from outside the government, relying on the bureaucracy and his sound
                    instincts about people. Eventually deputy negotiators were named, people from
                    the private sector who went through appointment procedures and became working
                    negotiators under Anderson's supervision.</p>
                <p>We restarted the negotiation process by defining our major issues and priorities,
                    and developing a new negotiating strategy based on these. By the time I left the
                    country directorate, we knew where we were going. The US bureaucracy had
                    coalesced, but we were only in the beginning stages of negotiations with the
                    Panamanians. Anderson and I, along with representatives of the Defense
                    Department, had concluded what were called “preliminary and exploratory talks”
                    with Panama's negotiators. Two wise men who had first been in business and then
                    became diplomats, Ellsworth Bunker and Sol Linowitz, negotiated new treaties to
                    a successful conclusion.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Most negotiations have their own rhythms, moving from progress to setback to
                    deadlock, and then break-through, on issue after issue. So it was with Panama.
                    Key issues for both sides were the timetables for turnover, security of the
                    canal and its efficient operation, the extent of the US military presence,
                    phased sharing of authority between Panama and the US, disposition of US
                    property, and economic benefits to Panama. These were not resolved until the
                    last moment, as is true in most negotiations, when both sides seek to maximize
                    their gains. And nothing was agreed in these negotiations until everything was
                    agreed, a stipulation Anderson made in the first of our preliminary and
                    exploratory talks. What emerged were the treaties of 1977, ratified in 1979.</p>
                <p>D General Omar Torrijos</p>
                <p>General Torrijos was largely unknown to Washington and our embassy in Panama.
                    Some of our military intelligence officers had dealt with him in the National
                    Guard. He had taken over Panama in a coup, shortly before I reported to the
                    Office of Panamanian Affairs. There was widespread distrust of him in
                    Washington, which had become accustomed to dealing with a compliant civilian
                    leadership in Panama, members of an oligarchy with whom it felt comfortable.
                    They were a known quantity with an affinity for the US and a vested interest in
                    stability. Torrijos, on the other hand, had the reputation of being a
                    nationalist and some called him a leftist. He was interested in raising Panama's
                    status: its dignity, as he called it. He rejected the treaty drafts negotiated
                    in 1968. We would be negotiating with someone who not only wanted to change the
                    treaty relationship, but who could be counted upon to take a nationalistic and
                    even demagogic stance on key issues.</p>
                <p>Once I had settled in during the summer of 1969, Ambassador Sayre suggested I
                    visit Panama. I went first to the town of David, near the large US military
                    training area of Rio Hatto where we had a one-man consulate at the time. A
                    question had been raised in Washington as to whether this area remained
                    necessary for US training requirements, and whether it might not be a positive
                    step to return Rio Hatto to Panama, as Torrijos was requesting. It was
                    returned.</p>
                <p>In David, I met Torrijos by pre-arrangement, together with William T. Pryce, the
                    embassy's political officer responsible for following internal affairs in
                    Panama. We joined Torrijos at a local bar to which he had invited us. He had
                    with him Jimmy Lakas, the official in charge of Panama's social security
                    program, and later designated president of Panama by Torrijos. Torrijos greeted
                    us warmly; he spoke no English and my Spanish was weak, so Pryce and Lakas did
                    the interpreting. As soon as we arrived at the bar, Torrijos ordered a bottle of
                    Johnny Walker Black and challenged me to a game of pinball, at which he was
                    known to excel. I hadn't played pinball since college days and never enjoyed it.
                    In one of the highlights of my career, I beat him. We then had an evening
                    together sniffing each other out.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>The next day, Torrijos invited us to drive with him through the countryside. He
                    had a terrible hangover. Jimmy Lakas was at the wheel, Torrijos in the front
                    seat, with Bill and I in back trying to cope with Torrijos' cigar smoke. The
                    general did not have much to say. Lakas and Torrijos wore side-arms and we had a
                    follow-up car with heavily armed security men. At lunch over wine, however, the
                    conversation became livelier. Torrijos was in fine humor after food and drink. I
                    eventually came to like him and felt instinctively that he trusted me.
                    Ambassador Sayre liked him personally and respected him. Bob and I thought we
                    could negotiate with Torrijos over the canal, a view we made known to skeptical
                    ears in Washington.</p>
                <p>Torrijos was a charismatic leader, popular among his people. He favored the
                    common man and took every opportunity to make that known. The gap between rich
                    and poor in Panama was wide, and Torrijos' populist message resonated with a lot
                    of Panamanians. The oligarchs hated him and distrusted his motives. He was a
                    handsome man with a drinker's belly, who liked women—and they liked him. He was
                    an effective leader of the National Guard, esteemed by his men. Manuel Noriega,
                    in charge of intelligence, was then one of his chief lieutenants and a principal
                    contact for our civilian and military intelligence people. Torrijos had a
                    reputation for being comparatively free of corruption, but I could not vouch for
                    that. He was straight-forward in what he said and did, and led a modest life
                    without the trappings of wealth and power of many of his Latin American
                    counterparts, although he worked closely with the business community.</p>
                <p>While Torrijos was critical and outspoken about the US role in Panama, which he
                    accurately described as colonial in many respects, he was capable of listening
                    as well as making populist speeches. One could have a rational discussion with
                    Torrijos. He quickly understood where you were coming from, a necessary quality
                    in his relations with Ambassador Sayre, who could be equally tough, blunt, and
                    persistent, in fluent Spanish. As we engaged in efforts to change the
                    fundamental relationships over the canal between our two countries, Torrijos
                    became immersed in the treaty negotiation process. Decisions of any consequence
                    needed his approval.</p>
                <p>My view of Torrijos was not popular in Washington, at least initially. People
                    felt uneasy about this military officer, leader of a National Guard known for
                    its corruption and blatant disregard for human rights, and a rumored narcotics
                    trafficker. He became a convenient scapegoat for treaty renegotiation opponents
                    in congress, who insisted we knew too little about Torrijos to make him a
                    trustworthy negotiating partner, and that what we did know was not encouraging.
                    Sayre and I never tried to portray him as a saint; that was hardly the issue.
                    The question was whether Torrijos was pragmatic, consistent, and above all
                    reliable. Could we work with him?</p>
                <p>Our official attitude towards Torrijos changed markedly by the end of my tour in
                    1971. We had serious differences with Panama and problems in our relations, but
                    we got past the hurdle of attributing bad faith and hidden motives to Torrijos
                    as an individual. Bob Sayre and succeeding ambassadors came to have workable
                    relations with him. From the outset the White House under Nixon and Carter never
                    wavered.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>In the end, we reached an agreement in 1978 which was fair and honorable for both
                    sides. Then Torrijos was killed in an unexplained plane crash in 1981. He was
                    one of a kind, and deserves a biography that displays his strong points, not
                    just the negative ones.</p>

                    Northeastern University's School of Journalism magna cum laude, Mark works in

                <p>10THE SENIOR SEMINAR, FOREIGN SERVICE INSTITUTE: 1971-72</p>
                <p>I asked for a year of training after my work on Panama, and was selected for the
                    State Department's Senior Seminar in Foreign Policy. Our nine months of study
                    and travel were bracketed by publication of the Pentagon Papers on Vietnam in
                    June of 1971 and the Watergate break-in of the offices of the Democratic
                    National Committee a year later, with the Vietnam War, student unrest, racial
                    turmoil, and the feminist and counter-cultural movements swirling in
                    between.</p>
                <p>The Seminar provides interdisciplinary and interagency training to people with
                    promising careers who have reached levels equivalent to colonel or one-star flag
                    officer. For an academic year, members of the Seminar study and travel together
                    in a program focused on American life and domestic issues, how these relate to
                    foreign policy and, in separate segments, management skills and national
                    security issues. It amounts to a rediscovery, or relearning, of America in a
                    conscious, structured way to make its members more effective representatives of
                    our country abroad because it has been disclosed to them anew. When traveling,
                    members read the local papers with their down-home view of the news and general
                    disinterest in Washington and events abroad. The Seminar amounts to service on
                    the “American Desk,” an immersion in the life and issues outside a parochial
                    capital.</p>
                <p>Of my 19 classmates, about half were from the State Department and half from
                    other agencies such as the military services, Treasury, CIA, Agriculture,
                    Commerce, USIA and AID. This mix of people working in the international field is
                    one of the great strengths of the Seminar; it would have been a less broadening
                    experience by far had all of us been Foreign Service officers. The setting for
                    Washington sessions at the Foreign Service Institute was informal. Lounging in
                    chairs with book arms, we spent two or three hours with each lecturer, much of
                    this time in a give-and-take with the guest. 1971 was an election year for
                    Nixon's second term, and we were absorbed in its politics. Our spouses were
                    invited to attend lectures that were not classified, and many took advantage of
                    this offer to study and learn together. Nine months gave us opportunities to be
                    with our children, which are not easy to find in a Washington job with its long
                    hours of work, including on weekends.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>We rode at night in squad cars with the Chicago police. We learned something
                    about American farming in Omaha. We went to military installations, such as
                    SAC/NORAD, and CINCPAC in Honolulu. We listened to jazz in New Orleans bars and
                    ate Oysters Rockefeller. We visited factories, art museums, and a futures market
                    in Chicago where people on the floor seemed engaged in an elaborate ballet. In
                    Atlanta, we visited black universities. We met with American Indians, nature
                    conservationists, and people who run welfare programs. In Boston, we discussed
                    state and federal relationships from the viewpoint of a state government. We
                    went to prisons and rehabilitation centers for drug addicts, and watched open
                    heart surgery in a students' amphitheater. We found that once we focused their
                    attention on foreign affairs, most Americans were interested. They were curious
                    to hear about our experiences abroad, the issues we had confronted, but above
                    all what it was like to live in different countries and cultures.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of the Seminar, we wrote individual case studies, which gave some
                    of us opportunities to travel abroad. My paper, “East Germany in Eastern Europe”
                    may have been a factor, later, in my assignment to East Berlin as deputy chief
                    of mission. I chose a topic which permitted me to visit the countries
                    surrounding East Germany: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania,
                    Yugoslavia, and then the Soviet Union to complete the picture. With the help of
                    our embassies, I talked with officials, academicians, journalists, and other
                    diplomats in order to assess their views of East and West Germany at the height
                    of the Cold War. I walked the streets, often ate alone in local restaurants,
                    visited historic sites, traveled on trains and felt myself a combination of
                    tourist and freelance reporter. I was struck once more by how distinct in every
                    way each of these countries was from the other.</p>
                <p>In part, these were my conclusions written 18 years before the two Germanies were
                    reunited on September 12, 1990:"I am struck more than anything else by the fact
                    that the Germans have now taken charge of the German question. Do both sides
                    already have some instinctive sense, as yet unformulated and unspoken, of the
                    possibility of renewed 'German' power in Europe? I suspect they do. This isn't
                    necessarily ominous...[T]he United States must find new ways to remain attuned
                    to German developments. We must not lag too far behind the actions of the
                    Federal Republic with regard to the recognition of East Germany. Once the
                    Germans have found a way to normalize their relations, and Bonn is prepared to
                    accord some form of recognition to Pankow, the western allies should be prompt
                    in following suit.” (May 1972)</p>
                <p>My year in the Seminar was the most professionally valuable and exciting training
                    I ever received. Tax payers rest assured: this is not a junket. The benefits to
                    professional experience never ceased, because we had new knowledge about America
                    to draw upon, and much of it became relevant in one way or another to nearly
                    everything we thought about and did from then onward.</p>

                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>A The Nature of Policy</p>
                <p>Foreign policy is made in many ways, a bit in long-range planning, which defines
                    major objectives and often reflects social values; most of it in day-to-day
                    decisions fine-tuning policies already in flow, or which fit easily into
                    established areas of consensus. Rarely are there overarching concepts—words dear
                    to planners—such as George Kennan's vision of “containment” as the basis for the
                    gamut of our relations with the Soviet Union. The Clinton administration tried
                    “enlargement” after the Cold War, but mercifully this never took hold.
                    “Enlargement” seemed to amount to an undifferentiated notion that America's
                    democracy and free markets should be extended everywhere.</p>
                <p>Policy is carried out through diplomacy, the management of international
                    relations by negotiation, be it around a conference table or in less formal
                    conversation between representatives of different governments. Its practice is
                    expected to reflect a sensitive appreciation of what is appropriate and proper
                    in dealing with others, as evidence of mutual respect and trust. The exercise of
                    diplomatic leverage is not inherently different from other peaceful uses of
                    power, whether in making business deals, asserting hierarchical authority, or
                    ruling as a judge. The appropriate diplomatic message may be unwelcome, harsh,
                    or threatening. Diplomacy is not the business of pleasing others at every turn;
                    it is usually a commitment to pursuing one's national interests.</p>
                <p>Long-range policy planning takes time and detachment. Secretary of State Marshall
                    created the Policy Planning Council in 1947 to give Kennan a base for this kind
                    of thinking after his famous Long Telegram a year earlier in which, as charg� in
                    Moscow after Averell Harriman's departure, Kennan made the case for containment.
                    Thereafter Acheson, as secretary, largely ignored Kennan and his small staff.
                    Once Dulles was installed he fired Kennan, yet asked him, incongruously and in
                    parting, to “come in from time to time to let us have your comments on what is
                    going on.”</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Most of what constitutes policy is shaped by the unpredictability and friction of
                    day-to-day relations, in which short-term objectives are quickly defined,
                    specific, limited, and pragmatic. Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs put it this way in
                    his memoirs—and he was writing about the 1930s: “Once something has been done,
                    it becomes the raw material of precedent; three or four precedents tied up in a
                    paper bag equal a policy neatly packaged.” Today, with the Cold War over, it is
                    more difficult to provide a larger sense of context and policy framework. There
                    isn't any single, pervasive adversary like the “evil empire” to engage, no “us”
                    and “them.” Day-to-day decisions tend to be reflexive, with Washington's desk
                    officers and assistant secretaries swinging their bats at every pitch crossing
                    the plate. These incremental decisions are not necessarily consistent with
                    longer range (if vaguely stated) objectives, and after a while can take on a new
                    direction and momentum of their own, the consequences of which no one may have
                    seriously thought through, or perhaps intended. Foreign policy is made in clumsy
                    ways. There is an old saw that applies: if you don't know where you're going,
                    any road will get you there. As ambassador, I reminded my country team of this
                    wisdom while we struggled with our crisis du jour. It is always useful to know
                    your destination.</p>
                <p>Ideally (and therefore never) the foreign policy process should go something like
                    this. The political leadership in the White House, cabinet and sub-cabinet
                    positions sets its objectives and determines broad policies when these are
                    important enough to warrant their attention. Some of these objectives may have
                    been sufficiently controversial to have been debated during the election
                    campaign, and can amount to political promises. Major changes in policy toward
                    Cuba would fall into this category. Ideally, this is a comprehensive,
                    tone-setting process at the beginning of an administration and its results are
                    ratified by the president, thereafter to be monitored by the National Security
                    Council staff. What one hopes for are the grand lines of strategy, as the French
                    put it, but these are not that often set.</p>
                <p>Then, under the direction of the secretary of state, professionals in the State
                    Department and other foreign affairs agencies in Washington get down to the
                    day-to-day business of interpreting broad policy guidance in light of specific
                    objectives, or problems that have landed on their desks. This takes a lot of
                    work and coordination, and is how most foreign policy professionals at the State
                    Department spend their time. When goals are clear, it is of course easier to
                    take the initiative and move pieces on the board. Our diplomats overseas provide
                    their perspectives, and make policy recommendations based upon their experience
                    and on-the-scene assessments. George Kennan's Long Telegram presented an
                    argument that could only have been made by someone at a typewriter in Moscow.
                    These diplomats also implement, through individual strategies and their greatly
                    varying diplomatic styles, policies that have been approved back home.</p>
                <p>Policy is made in Washington. And it is sometimes inspired, refined, challenged,
                    monitored, globalized, and imaginatively projected into the future by the
                    secretary of state's policy planning staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>B Policy Planning</p>
                <p>I have twice been assigned to the Policy Planning Staff (S/P), and worked with
                    five of its directors: William Cargo, James Sutterlin, Winston Lord, Samuel
                    Lewis and James Steinberg. Three were foreign service officers, one was
                    ex-foreign service (Lord), and one a non-career man who was primarily an
                    academic (Steinberg), although he had briefly worked in the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research before becoming director of the staff under Warren
                    Christopher. Kennan's Policy Planning Council consisted of six officers who
                    could sit comfortably around a small conference table. By 1973, this group had
                    expanded to 28, and it is in this company that I first worked on our global
                    concerns.</p>
                <p>There are two basic models for the policy planning function. The first is
                    reflective and disengaged, in which people largely spend their time writing
                    policy papers, a model adopted by Cargo and Sutterlin. The second is activist
                    and operational, adopted by Lord and Steinberg, who viewed themselves as
                    personal assistants to the secretary and thus became enmeshed in the policy and
                    implementation issues of daily concern to him. The S/P staff below them became
                    advisers on operational issues; the office churned under pressures and
                    deadlines, like the rest of the Department. Collegiality and “the long view”
                    yielded to day-to-day quick fixes. The secretaries of state in these instances
                    were the greatly differing Henry Kissinger and Warren Christopher.</p>
                <p>Two examples illustrate the point. When the Yom Kippur War broke out in 1973,
                    Sutterlin was in the countryside holding a weekend planning session with his
                    staff. Word came by phone that no one need return to Washington, but our Middle
                    East experts drove back anyway. The Arab Oil Embargo, later in 1973, occurred on
                    Lord's watch. S/P was consumed in preparing an ill-conceived Washington energy
                    conference of importing nations, finding little time to hear the views of
                    renowned petroleum experts Walter Levy and Melvin Conant, who flew to Washington
                    to be available.</p>
                <p>An exception to these two models was S/P under Samuel Lewis, who had earlier been
                    Lord's principal deputy, and was its first director in the Christopher era.
                    Lewis ran an office which had some of the characteristics of both models. He
                    wanted his staff to be reflective and activist, and it ended in being neither
                    very successfully, although this was not Sam's fault. Generally the activist
                    directors were more effective; they and their staffs had greater impact on the
                    policy process. The most successful directors had strong personal relationships
                    with the secretary built upon trust and unfettered access. Those who did not
                    enjoy such visible support had a difficult time being heard by other policy
                    makers.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>What is the appropriate role for S/P in a new administration? It is to understand
                    the past, produce what the secretary and deputy secretary ask for, and then lead
                    them in anticipating future needs. What a secretary wants, and what he or she
                    needs but does not yet know he wants, constitutes S/P's work, or most of it. S/P
                    requires strong ties to all of the bureaus so it can understand their daily work
                    and problems, and must therefore have access to the paper flow on issues of
                    policy between the Seventh Floor and the rest of the organization. The key to
                    such access is the Executive Secretariat (S/S) which acts, among other
                    functions, as a paper-flow police force. Becoming part of the policy-making
                    cycle is often S/P's greatest bureaucratic challenge, matched only by its
                    tendency to become a bottleneck once this happens. Too often S/P members brood
                    about their views and fuss over how to articulate them elegantly. When that
                    occurs, the issue is resolved without S/P's participation. Hence, the harried
                    looks of those caught in the activist and operational model.</p>
                <p>The influence of S/P depends on the luster of its staff, and there has been
                    unevenness in the quality of that office. Once its intellectual vigor is
                    diminished, S/P can easily be cut out of the policy process. During my first
                    tour in S/P, when Winston Lord was its director, the staff consisted primarily
                    of foreign service officers. Under Sam Lewis in 1993, at least 40% of the staff
                    came from other places—civil service, the military, and academia—many, but not
                    all of whom, made important contributions.</p>
                <p>There are natural allies for S/P beyond the secretary's office and S/S. The
                    Bureau of Intelligence and Research is one of these on substantive issues and
                    interagency intelligence matters. Sam Lewis made a successful effort to join
                    INR's and CIA's work with S/P's. It was an inspired initiative, and succeeded as
                    long as the distinction between the INR/CIA contribution (background and
                    analysis), and S/P's (policy options and recommendations), was kept intact.</p>
                <p>It is also important for S/P to be provided observer status on trips by foreign
                    policy leaders, as well as at major conferences and negotiations. This gives its
                    staff opportunities to understand the secretary's personal and negotiating
                    styles. An S/P member can be useful in providing a fresh perspective, evoking
                    larger contexts and consequences, playing devil's advocate and, in short, being
                    a constructive kibitzer. Such participation provides S/P better insight into
                    what people on the other side of the table are seeking. It gives a first-hand
                    view of the positions and bureaucratic politics of other US government agencies,
                    builds personal relationships, and facilitates follow-up support. And finally,
                    one cannot underestimate the importance to S/P's legitimization in the
                    bureaucracy if it is seen as a major policy player, evidenced by its members'
                    participation in the secretary's meetings, travels, negotiations—and card games
                    on the aircraft.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>My first S/P assignment during 1972-74 was as deputy director for policy
                    coordination, another Kissinger innovation. William Cargo was then its director.
                    He was a man of idealism and imagination, but not a strong bureaucratic force.
                    With a passive William Rogers as secretary of state and an overbearing Henry
                    Kissinger as national security adviser, there was little opportunity for S/P to
                    make an impact. A few individual members in exotic areas of specialization were
                    influential; that has always been the case, and held true for the few months
                    during which James Sutterlin, an old German hand, was director. There was no
                    broader market in this environment for S/P's product.</p>
                <p>I was already in S/P when Winston Lord arrived in 1973. Lord, intense and
                    hard-driving, had served on the NSC staff under Kissinger, and made the opening
                    trip to China with him. He was attuned to Kissinger's thinking, methods, and
                    self-centered style; from the outset he could speak with authority about the
                    secretary's views, and on his behalf. Foreign policy was in Kissinger's iron
                    grip as no other secretary of state had controlled it. Policy planners were at
                    the receiving end of his orders; we were, in effect, an appendage to his office.
                    His communications to us were through Lord and speech-writers on our staff.
                    Meetings had been scheduled at the beginning to permit the secretary to meet his
                    planners, but in HAK fashion they were canceled at the last minute. On issues of
                    concern to him, his private strategies and use of back channels held sway.</p>
                <p>Because Lord was so entirely an extension of Kissinger, his authority in the
                    Department was rarely questioned, and sometimes feared. I think this led S/P to
                    play too activist a role, overwhelming its staff and their advisory functions.
                    We became an echo of Kissinger, frequently instructing other offices in the
                    Department on what they should do. Things got done, but this behavior merged the
                    profile of S/P with that of the secretary's office, sometimes to the detriment
                    and bureaucratic confusion of the Department's best intentioned people.</p>
                <p>An important S/P function is speech-writing. When Lord became director, the staff
                    quickly assumed this responsibility. S/P drafted all of Kissinger's major
                    speeches during his tour as secretary, or at least had a strong hand in the
                    final product. There were excellent writers on the staff, among them Mark
                    Palmer; Win himself devoted much time to this function. Kissinger recognized, as
                    other secretaries have, that speeches are a good way to make and articulate
                    policy, float trial balloons, and nip speculation. Kissinger took his speeches
                    unnervingly seriously. We would get back draft after draft, even portions we
                    knew he had never read. A draft would reach his desk; impatient, and without
                    reading it, he would scrawl “Improve this!” and bounce it back to S/P for
                    another round of writing.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>At its best, S/P is an informed, wise and questioning voice in the hurly-burly of
                    the Department's life. S/P can function best when there is a strategic policy
                    view, or at least an interest in reaching such a view. Much of Kissinger's
                    approach (d�tente with the Soviet Union, the opening to China, arms
                    negotiations, the Middle East peace process) evolved during his time as national
                    security adviser. He therefore brought to the Department an intellectual
                    construct for foreign policy that had been accepted and was being acted upon
                    when he became secretary, which, in turn, enabled Lord's S/P to make important
                    contributions to the tactics of implementation.</p>
                <p>Kissinger, nevertheless, was a secretary who insisted on intellectual rigor and
                    discipline within the Department. His academic credentials were widely known. He
                    believed decisions and actions should occur in a larger “conceptual framework,”
                    and sent back policy option papers in which (B) was the only choice, usually a
                    tepid “slight-change” option surrounded by (A) “change nothing,” and (C) “bomb
                    them,” or so it seemed. Few other secretaries have insisted with such force that
                    papers reaching them be based on well reasoned arguments, and that options be
                    realistic and comprehensive. This did not mean, of course, that Kissinger's
                    decisions were validated by what followed. Many were not. But it did mean that
                    Kissinger's stewardship created an intellectual environment of extraordinary
                    challenge and discipline which extracted the best work the State Department was
                    capable of producing. While lawyers Vance and Christopher, for example, kept
                    their doors more open, it seemed to me they imposed less rigorous standards.</p>
                <p>C The NSC Under Secretaries Committee</p>
                <p>In the early 1970s, S/P became the office of policy planning and coordination, a
                    concept that ended after the Ford administration, when S/P reverted to being a
                    planning office. The coordination function grew out of Kissinger's concept of an
                    NSC mechanism with himself at its center, conceived in a suite at the Pierre
                    Hotel in New York as he and president-elect Nixon diagramed a national security
                    structure for the new administration. S/P's coordination function involved
                    organizing and directing work required by the Under Secretaries Committee (USC),
                    also a newly created institution. The USC was the second-level review committee
                    in the NSC process, short of the National Security Council itself, chaired by
                    the deputy secretary of state and controlled by Kissinger. On these matters, I
                    worked directly with John Irwin, whose special assistant was Nicholas Veliotes,
                    and then Kenneth Rush, aided by Michael Samuels.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The USC included representatives of the same departments and agencies that were
                    statutory members of the NSC, i.e. State, Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                    CIA and the NSC staff. But it also drew on other departments and agencies,
                    depending on the issue to be addressed; we had a roster of some 20 other
                    government entities who would become involved on an ad hoc basis. The USC was
                    the leading interagency coordinating mechanism under the direction of the
                    National Security Council. Those of us who were its staff directors, Arthur
                    Hartman, Seymour Weiss, myself and Wreatham Gathright, were acutely conscious
                    that we had allegiances both to the Department and NSC. This meant we had to
                    view the Department as only one of the principal contributors to an issue—not
                    easy with Kissinger as secretary of state—and we tried to serve the system
                    objectively. We sought to convey to its participants a sense of the intellectual
                    fairness of the process, which from time to time caused irritation in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>The Committee met about once every two or three months. The USC staff prepared
                    studies and decision papers, and we monitored issues and negotiations on a
                    continuing basis. We had a fixed group of addressees, a system for selective
                    distribution of papers, a process for convening ad hoc working meetings, a
                    procedure for clearances of draft memoranda and decision papers, and a mechanism
                    for obtaining presidential or the NSC adviser's approval of documents. Formal
                    decisions were in writing and signed by Kissinger in his dual role as NSC
                    adviser, or by the president. All of this was managed before the introduction of
                    desk-top and personal computers. It sounds numbingly bureaucratic, but when the
                    policy interests of large numbers of people from different vantage points become
                    legitimately engaged in decisions, some kind of mechanism needs to pull the
                    process together. Bigness brings its own requirements.</p>
                <p>We were the interagency coordinating mechanism for Law of the Sea negotiations,
                    CSCE issues, Micronesian status negotiations, SALT verification, and many other
                    activities, often long-range issues which would take years to resolve. There
                    were other matters to be settled more quickly, such as the USSR-US cultural
                    agreements and underground nuclear testing issues. Because it had such an
                    effective clearance system, the USC was designated to settle many discrete, and
                    often urgent interagency problems. We could call a meeting at a few hours'
                    notice and be assured that the empowered action officers from each agency would
                    show up. Often I led such meetings. We became a quick fix mechanism for
                    different kinds of problems not vital in themselves, but in need of attention
                    and resolution. My efficient assistant Louise Froebe made it all happen
                    expeditiously.</p>
                <p>The issue that engaged us deeply was the Law of the Sea negotiations. These were
                    the most complex global negotiations ever undertaken, and of exceptional
                    interest to the private sector, especially for their resource implications. One
                    of the major stumbling blocks, for example, was deep sea mining rights for
                    valuable manganese nodules. This problem and several other issues such as
                    fishing rights, territorial waters, and passage through straits, often seemed
                    beyond resolution. A Law of the Sea treaty was finally negotiated, but the US
                    has not ratified it.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Interestingly, one of the most strained periods in the Cold War, the US and
                    Soviet Union agreed on many Law of the Sea questions, an example of how specific
                    concerns of mutual interest and benefit can transcend traditional barriers and
                    unite antagonists. Law of the Sea negotiations were led for the US side by John
                    Norton Moore at the time. He reported to the deputy secretary and received his
                    formal interagency instructions through the NSC system. Moore's team of lawyers
                    often strayed from legal matters into policy, and were difficult to control, a
                    problem I have found common among lawyers dealing with foreign relations.</p>
                <p>The Under Secretaries Committee became the repository for documents recording
                    hundreds of decisions accompanied by memoranda from various parts of the
                    government leading to these decisions. We had extensive files; the system lived
                    on paper. In these files one can now find a chronological, thorough paper trail
                    leading to a decision, or the resolution over a long period of time of a set of
                    issues. We became the office of record, the institutional memory for the
                    duration of Nixon's and Ford's presidencies.</p>
                <p>D Contingency Planning</p>
                <p>I became involved in world-wide contingency planning by the top secret Washington
                    Special Action Group (WASAG) through its small interagency working committee.
                    The WASAG, too, was part of the NSC system under Kissinger. Charged with
                    developing contingency plans, this senior body found it difficult to make time
                    for such work, or even decide on how to go about its task. Our small committee
                    was established to select the eight or ten most likely areas where a serious
                    foreign policy crisis might erupt. We developed a format for contingency
                    planning and put together contingency plans for these carefully selected trouble
                    spots.</p>
                <p>The covering document in a red 3-ring notebook described a possible contingency,
                    such as the outbreak of hostilities between Greece and Turkey, and the factors
                    that might have given rise to it. We defined US interests, provided an analysis
                    of likely issues, and prepared options for first steps in a US response. One of
                    the notebook's sections listed material and political resources available to the
                    US to assist in the resolution of the crisis. Another listed people in the US
                    government (or retired from it) with special knowledge of the region and its
                    personalities, including former ambassadors and DCMs. These notebooks included
                    intelligence material, city maps, and other factual information of use to WASAG
                    members, the regional bureaus, and State's Operations Center in the event of a
                    blow-up. While emergencies never occur as one might imagine them, these
                    materials would have been something with which to begin. These plans did not
                    survive the Nixon era, however, and were packed up for his presidential library,
                    or perhaps destroyed.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Each administration devises its own national security processes and tends to
                    disregard what has been done by the previous one. “If we didn't invent it—it
                    can't be any good,” goes the thinking. It is shocking how neglected the old
                    files quickly become, many of them providing insight and a history of dealing
                    with thorny issues. The same mistakes are repeated. The same options
                    rediscovered, or never thought of. The proverbial wheel is reinvented again and
                    again in a needless waste of time and effort.</p>
                <p>Twenty years later, in 1992, when I returned to S/P during the Clinton
                    administration, contingency planning was done informally, ad hoc, and not on an
                    interagency basis. We were engaged in struggles to find day-to-day approaches to
                    such long-smouldering headaches as Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and the Middle East.
                    These were the hot spots facing Clinton's team, yet little attention was given
                    them at the outset by the Department's new leaders, and eventually all of them
                    blew up. In the mindsets of new people, such problems belong in the past; they
                    prefer to write on clean slates.</p>
                <p>This only reinforces the argument for establishing a Permanent Under Secretary
                    position in the Department of State, and creating an institutional memory to
                    serve a new leadership team and make the foreign policy process more efficient,
                    consistent and informed. It borders on the insane that every four or eight years
                    our new foreign policy managers start afresh on problems that have been studied
                    and acted upon by their predecessors and are often uncontroversial in terms of
                    US policy. Congressional staffs, CIA, and the Defense Department keep their
                    records and know what they contain. The countries with which we deal know well
                    the history of our relations with them. No wonder the State Department has
                    trouble asserting its primacy! Far too much in its system depends on the veneer
                    of newly acquired knowledge. By the time new leaders hit their stride, the next
                    election comes around and institutional memory is once more in peril.</p>
                <p>The State Department does not have a process for crisis prevention through
                    preventive diplomacy. Such thinking should become an additional task for S/P, in
                    tandem with INR. Playing devil's advocate has an element of crisis prevention,
                    because it forces people to think through the consequences of action or
                    inaction, but this is not the same as contingency planning. An attempt to look
                    beyond the day is difficult, time-consuming, and frustrating for any bureau
                    burdened with its continuing pressures of work. Contingency planning and
                    preventive diplomacy require time for reflection.</p>
                <p>A strong S/P should supplement what the bureaus do. S/P has the luxury of having
                    more time and a broader mandate than the regional and functional bureaus. It
                    must do more to assist these bureaus in looking ahead, particularly since S/P
                    has an integrating perspective on the world.</p>
                <p>E Crisis Management</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Crisis management differs from contingency planning in that a crisis has already
                    occurred, as in Bosnia, or Iran when hostages were seized. The response needs
                    direction and supervision. Crisis can be defined as an unstable state of
                    affairs. The State Department has for years thought about how to cope with
                    crises, as one of its leading responsibilities. There are essentially two ways
                    of doing so: through normal bureaucratic channels that can be used effectively
                    until, and unless, the crisis becomes so complex and expanded that these
                    channels are overwhelmed; or by creating ad hoc, tailor-made task forces
                    comprised of carefully selected people brought together to achieve specific
                    goals in a limited time frame with specially allocated resources. The task force
                    concept, military in origin, is an effective management device. Task forces are
                    located in the Department's Operations Center on the Seventh Floor, with its
                    global communications network. Secure conference rooms enable people to sit
                    around large tables with telephones and computers at hand. Maps and action
                    boards line the walls.</p>
                <p>There are different kinds of crises, and each is sui generis. One distinction is
                    whether the crisis could have been anticipated, and whether we were prepared for
                    it. There are also some which cannot be foreseen specifically, but can be
                    planned for generally. For example, an earthquake in Mexico is a natural
                    disaster of a recurring kind and permanent mechanisms exist to deal with
                    disaster relief. The PanAm-103 crash caused by terrorists, however, would have
                    been difficult to foresee but not impossible to imagine. The Jonestown mass
                    suicides in Guyana constituted a crisis out of the blue for which contingency
                    planning or preventive action could not have been expected.</p>
                <p>Some activities are fully anticipated; indeed, they are launched by the
                    government, bringing with them an obligation to pre-load crisis management
                    aspects. For the Gulf War, a large task force was convened in advance, operating
                    for many months under the astute direction of Ambassador Mary Ryan. It was so
                    effective as a management tool that it was kept in being longer than necessary.
                    A second example is the Somalia humanitarian relief operation, whose task force
                    I led. The US government decided to take the initiative in this case, which
                    provided the opportunity to create an appropriate task force in advance and
                    coordinate from the beginning activities designed to launch and manage our
                    relief efforts.</p>
                <p>A task force is usually necessary when there is need for central management of
                    government activities in a foreign policy emergency which will endure for more
                    than 48 hours. This may seem like a short time frame, but no bureau is staffed
                    to act around the clock for longer than two days. Some of the components that
                    make task forces necessary are these:</p>
                <p>(1)Need for extensive coordination by the executive branch within its own ranks,
                    with congress, the UN, other governments, private citizens, the media and
                    private voluntary organizations; (2)policy and operational complexities of such
                    magnitude that a constellation of carefully chosen, dedicated people is
                    required; (3)recognition that US government involvement will be
                    around-the-clock; the rest of the world is not on Washington time and informed
                    people in Washington must always be available; (4)major use of resources
                    (people, money, time, space, equipment, relief supplies, etc.) which must rely
                    on adequate delivery systems; and (5)need for a visible, recognized, and
                    empowered center which becomes the reference point for information and
                    coordination of actions.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The task force process responds to all of these needs. It serves senior leaders
                    directly and outside “the system.” It prepares status reports at least twice
                    daily, usually in messages sent to our posts around the world. It coordinates
                    the activities of the Department of State on a world-wide basis, as well as
                    those of other agencies. It becomes the repository for records in the evolution
                    of a crisis: actions taken, meetings held, options considered, responsibilities
                    assigned. Its extensive files become the institutional memory, at least for the
                    duration of the crisis. Its experiences in getting started and functioning
                    efficiently should become accumulated knowledge for successor task forces to
                    draw upon as they, themselves, get launched.</p>
                <p>F The World Outside</p>
                <p>People who work at the State Department do not live their days in tight
                    compartments separating their professional and personal lives. It all flows
                    together. I say this because in August, 1974 Richard Nixon resigned as
                    president. The buildup of the Watergate fiasco over the previous two years had
                    strained credulity time and again. It did not seem possible that these things
                    were happening. One held one's breath in picking up the morning's Washington
                    Post from the doormat outside, and braced for its headlines. We took these
                    concerns to the office and they haunted us. People in government realized with
                    particular immediacy that for the first time in our history a presidency was
                    collapsing, disintegrating. The president and some of his most senior advisers
                    were lying to the American people. Watergate came to dominate conversations in
                    our early morning encounters and over cafeteria lunches, sometimes in the form
                    of jokes, but more often with shock, sorrow and a feeling of national shame.</p>
                <p>For members of the Policy Planning Staff there was added impact because we were
                    part of Henry Kissinger's team, and as secretary of state he was trying to keep
                    our foreign policy separate from this series of disasters, fearing that in the
                    Cold War we might appear weak to the Russians and the world. It is a confusing,
                    sour and depressing experience, to say the least, to work on major policy issues
                    of our government while its chief executive, who is responsible for the conduct
                    of foreign relations, faces impeachment.</p>
                <p>12DCM, THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC, BERLIN: 1974-76</p>
                <p>Staring out my window at the dark sky from a plane taking me to East Berlin as
                    the first American diplomat to be accredited to the German Democratic Republic,
                    I thought of the comic irony of my first experience there, sixteen years
                    earlier, in May of 1958.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>Before joining the Foreign Service and while staying with my parents in London, I
                    visited the Soviet Union and Poland with a tour group and remained for a few
                    days in Warsaw to spend some time with my uncle Wladek and his family. From
                    Warsaw I continued by train to Berlin, with a plane ticket in my pocket to go on
                    to London that afternoon. When East German border guards came through the train
                    outside Berlin they asked to see my transit visa, which the travel office in
                    Warsaw had failed to provide. After checking with the responsible Soviet
                    officer, they escorted me off the train. Watching incredulously as the train
                    left the station without me, I foolishly asked to speak to the American
                    consul.</p>
                <p>There was, of course, no such person in the Soviet Zone in 1958. I soon found
                    myself in an officers' compartment of a Soviet furlough train, drinking tea from
                    the samovar at the end of the coach. Back in the Warsaw travel office, and
                    feeling a bit ridiculous, I got the necessary visa placed in my passport and
                    once more set out for Berlin on the following morning, where it was stamped by
                    the same soldiers I had argued with on the previous day. When my mother met me
                    at London's Heathrow Airport she said, “I knew you'd be arrested on this trip!”
                    And here I was, returning to East Germany to become, in effect, the unavailable
                    American consul. I knew that in every way my service in Berlin this time would
                    be different. The Cold War had not only entered a new phase but, as Heraclitus
                    put it, “you cannot step twice into the same river.”</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>On September 4, 1974 the United States signed an agreement with the German
                    Democratic Republic (GDR) in the austere Treaty Room of the Department of State
                    which established normal diplomatic relations. I was present when Assistant
                    Secretary of State for European Affairs Arthur Hartman signed for the US at a
                    small ceremony. The US side had no smiles for photographers. Our posture was
                    that we had recognized the GDR to remain in step with the Federal Republic,
                    France, and Great Britain who had already done so. In fact, we were the 111th
                    country to recognize the German Democratic Republic.</p>
                <p>I was aware from my work on the Policy Planning Staff in the early 1970s that we
                    were considering establishing relations with East Germany, and kept track of the
                    issue through a life-long interest in German affairs. Former Senator John
                    Sherman Cooper would become our first ambassador, and the Department was looking
                    for someone with experience in Berlin to be his deputy, or DCM. The case study I
                    had written in the Senior Seminar on the standing of East Germany in Eastern
                    Europe helped whet my appetite for this assignment. In the summer of 1974, I let
                    Hartman know I would like to be considered for Berlin. I first met Cooper when
                    he called on Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1974 as ambassador-designate.
                    He stopped by my office to chat, knowing I was interested in becoming his
                    deputy. I found John Sherman Cooper, at 73, an excessively courteous, formal,
                    soft-spoken southern gentleman with the bearing and aloof manners of an earlier
                    age. At the end of approximately half an hour, he seemed satisfied that we could
                    work together. I hoped we could.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>A Status of Berlin</p>
                <p>I brought myself up to date on German affairs and planned to leave for Berlin in
                    October. My wife and children, for schooling reasons, would not be joining me in
                    Berlin until Christmas. Although I was to become the first American
                    representative accredited to the German Democratic Republic, we were not
                    charting entirely new waters. France and the UK had preceded us. Their embassies
                    were functioning in East Berlin and their pioneering work became helpful to
                    us.</p>
                <p>We were all accredited to the German Democratic Republic and worked and lived in
                    East Berlin, which the Western Allies did not consider part of the territory of
                    the GDR. This created a semantic issue. Absent a peace treaty and final
                    settlement of other issues surrounding the defeat of Nazi Germany, East Berlin
                    was merely the Soviet sector of a city, Greater Berlin, occupied by the four
                    wartime powers: the US, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Berlin was
                    therefore not part of East Germany. The surrounding countryside was. Upshot: we
                    styled ourselves embassies to (not in) the GDR. These were not arcane legalisms,
                    but went to the heart of the post-war status of defeated Germany, “the Four
                    Power rights and responsibilities for Berlin and Germany as a whole.”</p>
                <p>We maintained this distinction when it came to the functions of the American
                    ambassador in East Berlin and his staff, on the one hand, and our ambassador in
                    Bonn and his staff on the other. Martin Hillenbrand, a lifelong expert on German
                    affairs and foreign service officer, was then our ambassador in Bonn. If a
                    problem involving the Soviet authorities arose in Berlin that had to be dealt
                    with at the High Commissioner level, John Cooper could not address it because
                    such issues fell to Hillenbrand. Hillenbrand, with his residual powers as
                    successor to the High Commissioner, periodically came to East Berlin to see his
                    counterpart, Soviet Ambassador Piotr Abrasimov, in order to keep in touch and
                    deal with just such matters.</p>
                <p>The Soviets simplified their approach to this duality of roles by appointing
                    Abrasimov both their ambassador to the GDR and, in effect, Soviet High
                    Commissioner. He, however, lived in the Soviet sector, and not, in our view, in
                    the GDR. Hillenbrand would drive through “Checkpoint Charlie” with his
                    ambassadorial flags flying, visit the Soviet embassy, transact his business with
                    Abrasimov, and return to Bonn via West Berlin. It was all rather complicated,
                    but not without logic and purpose: the Allies would not permit the post-war
                    legal status of Berlin to erode.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>The American military commandant in West Berlin also came to East Berlin to meet
                    with the Russians. Western Allied military in West Berlin had continuing
                    contacts with the Soviet military on issues that dealt with the city or one of
                    its sectors. The military met at Potsdam, outside East Berlin. Americans
                    stationed in West Berlin could cross to the east only through “Checkpoint
                    Charlie,” showing their documents to GDR or Soviet authorities through the
                    closed windows of their cars. We, on the other hand, who were accredited to East
                    Germany, passed through any of the East German checkpoints, showing our red
                    diplomatic identification booklets to East German personnel. If there were
                    problems for us at the crossing points, we, as accredited diplomats, would ask
                    for a GDR foreign ministry representative, rather than the Soviet officer. All
                    Americans and their dependents assigned to the GDR had to learn and observe
                    these rules.</p>
                <p>B Ambassador and Mrs. Cooper</p>
                <p>Senator Cooper enjoyed a year of service as ambassador to India in the Eisenhower
                    administration. A liberal Republican, he resigned after Kennedy took office. In
                    1974, his socially prominent wife, Lorraine, began lobbying Secretary Kissinger
                    during Georgetown dinner parties to appoint her husband to the GDR. As I was
                    leaving for Berlin to prepare the way, Winston Lord, head of the Policy Planning
                    Staff, told me Kissinger had directed the State Department to expedite its
                    efforts to send Cooper to East Germany in order to “get that woman off my back.”
                    Lorraine, who would have been delighted to know this, was instrumental in having
                    her husband appointed and despatched on his mission to Berlin.</p>
                <p>Cooper was a prominent political figure and turned out to be a fine ambassador in
                    many ways. He was also hard of hearing. Like many older men—Averell Harriman
                    comes to mind—he was not willing to wear a hearing aid, and communicating with
                    him was difficult. I opened any conversation with a short sentence to get his
                    attention, and then repeated it because his first response invariably was
                    “WHAT?” Anyone who worked closely with Cooper had to adjust to this, including
                    our East German hosts.</p>
                <p>Cooper was a shrewd judge of people, especially as to their potential for
                    trustworthiness. He came from Pulaski County, Kentucky and a family of modest
                    means. He had been a judge and risen to the US Senate. There, he was the
                    co-author of the Cooper-Church amendment which stopped funding for the Vietnam
                    War. He had finely honed political instincts, and was not naive or anyone's
                    patsy. The East Germans recognized his abilities; they also respected him
                    because of his age, bearing, and old world manners, which they particularly
                    liked. He looked the part. This was true of the Soviets in East Berlin as well,
                    especially Ambassador Abrasimov, who had been the Soviet representative for
                    many, many years and was himself a canny old fox.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>The East Germans and Soviets were delighted not only to have American
                    representation in East Berlin, but to gain this in a person of Cooper's renown.
                    Our presence and the American flag flapping from a window pole represented to
                    them the completion of a legitimization process by the West, the much sought
                    Anerkennung which had begun when the French and British opened their embassies
                    in East Berlin quite a few months before. Allied policy in this regard was not
                    to get ahead of the West Germans in Bonn. The two Germanys had established
                    relationships earlier in the form of Permanent Representatives which enabled the
                    French, the British, and then ourselves to follow.</p>
                <p>Cooper could not speak more than ten words of German, although he had served
                    briefly in Germany during World War II where he was for a short time married to
                    an American Army nurse. That did not stop him from getting along remarkably well
                    with Germans. He communicated with them in ways that were mysterious to me. I
                    remember one day, long after the embassy had opened, when the East Germans
                    changed foreign ministers. Oskar Fischer was the new man. Cooper had been asked
                    to make a courtesy call, and before he was to go we had arranged to meet in
                    front of the Unter den Linden Hotel, where we were all living at the time.</p>
                <p>I arrived from my office to find Cooper standing outside eating wurst and
                    chatting with the street vendor. I don't know what common language they found
                    because neither could speak the other's tongue. Cooper was about two-thirds
                    finished with his wurst, when I suggested that we start our walk to the foreign
                    ministry, or we would be late. Cooper folded a flimsy paper napkin around the
                    uneaten part of the wurst and stuck it in his coat pocket.</p>
                <p>When we arrived at the ministry we were escorted into the minister's gloomy and
                    oppressively furnished chambers, where we witnessed an unusual performance on
                    the part of a foreign minister. Fischer sat very close to Cooper, barely 18
                    inches away and, leaning forward, stared intently into his face. This behavior
                    was disconcerting to Cooper, and I found myself repressing laughter. Ours was
                    essentially a courtesy call, with Fischer mouthing platitudes and Cooper going
                    through a few lackluster talking points. We finally left this odd scene and
                    strolled back to the hotel, laughing about the meeting just ended. Cooper kept
                    imitating the foreign minister by sticking his face close to mine just as
                    Fischer had done with him. We found the episode incomprehensible. While Cooper
                    was imitating Fischer, I kept thinking about the wurst which was still in his
                    pocket. I knew that his personal assistant, Trudy Musson from Louisville, a
                    vivaciously competent person Cooper had brought with him from his Senate office,
                    would soon discover this greasy leftover, as she discovered so many other odd
                    things in her boss's overcoat pockets, which she had learned to check from time
                    to time.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Cooper used to forget things like that rather frequently. He was a meticulous
                    dresser, but sloppy otherwise. In his first few days at the embassy, he received
                    at least one security violation notice every night from the Marine guard who
                    inspected our offices after we left. He discarded everything in his waste
                    basket. We finally decided to declare the waste basket a classified area, so
                    everything in the basket would go into the burn bag at the end of the day.
                    Cooper was in deep contrition after each violation of security and apologized
                    elaborately to the Marines but never changed his habits. Our Marines loved
                    Cooper. Each time one of them was promoted, he assembled all of us in his
                    office, the full detachment appearing in their dress uniforms. As he read the
                    standard citation of service to country, his voice began to crack about half way
                    through. At the end we were all on the verge of patriotic tears, each and every
                    time.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Cooper, married three times, was a leading social force on the Georgetown
                    scene. A petite, elegant woman of great taste who favored large hats and
                    parasols as protection from the sun, she was for many years on the “best
                    dressed” lists of fashion writers. She was a stickler for correct behavior and,
                    like John, could be stuffy at times, which seemed odd because in private her
                    humor was sharp and did not avoid vulgarity, any more than his did. By the time
                    she arrived in Berlin, Lorraine must have been in her late 60s. She was a
                    Californian who had never gone to college, but was one of the best read and
                    brightest people I have known. Mrs. Cooper's invitations were prized; she held
                    an annual garden buffet at the Cooper's N Street home in Georgetown, the
                    invitation to which read: “In Honor of the United States Senate.” A large
                    portion of the Senate and many other luminaries showed up, making this a major
                    event for Washingtonians and their social pages.</p>
                <p>Lorraine, also, was an extraordinarily shrewd observer, clever in assessing
                    people, often catty and funny about them, and always in search of their strong
                    and weak points. She had a fine sense of what motivated people. She has been
                    compared in print to Mrs. Lightfoot Lee, the heroine in Henry Adams' novel
                    Democracy, a book I read years earlier, and I found the comparison apt.
                    Lorraine's political instincts were as good as her husband's; she had an
                    appreciation of what was really going on. She was unfailingly supportive and
                    always spoke lovingly of him, even when he was in one of his moody periods which
                    occurred periodically.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I admired how warm and friendly Lorraine was with our small embassy staff. She
                    took a genuine interest in them, their problems, their families. What made them
                    laugh made her laugh too. She was at once a grande dame and a Mensch. John
                    married her sooner than they had planned so she could accompany him to New
                    Delhi, where she had a brief exposure to embassy life. She had traveled
                    extensively, and lived in Italy and France as a young woman. She spoke good
                    French and Italian, and had studied Russian in Washington with the help of my
                    wife's grandfather, her friend Sergei Cheremeteff. Lorraine made an effort to
                    learn German, enough to handle pleasantries. She also had, far more than her
                    husband, a sense of adventure. Lorraine saw the Coopers doing in East Germany
                    what the David Bruces had accomplished in China. They were pioneering Americans
                    carrying the flag to new territory. Evangeline Bruce was a close friend, and
                    Lorraine reflected her elegance and savoir faire. Lorraine was an intensely
                    patriotic American, and she let it show in ways that made her an enthusiastic
                    voice for our country.</p>
                <p>My relationship with the Coopers was never easy in Berlin, although John Sherman
                    Cooper and I made an effective team and worked well together. There were moments
                    of strain, often stemming from Lorraine's vision of what the US embassy
                    residence in Berlin should be. The State Department was never able to satisfy
                    her completely, although it tried to. After our tour in Berlin was over, the
                    Coopers became two of my closest friends. We saw a great deal of each other in
                    Washington. When I felt low, Lorraine would buck me up. At the N Street house, I
                    poured for her the last glass of champagne she would drink. Shortly after I left
                    the Cooper's home that evening, Lorraine suffered a massive stroke from which
                    she never regained consciousness. The two of us had been gossiping about friends
                    in Berlin.</p>
                <p>C Establishing the Embassy</p>
                <p>Cooper's main objectives in the new relationship with the GDR were to establish
                    respect for the United States on the part of the regime and a favorable image of
                    our country in the eyes of East Germans; to keep the performance of his embassy
                    within the bounds of post-war Allied rights, responsibilities and practices, a
                    task he largely left to me; to lay the basis, on the scene, for what we
                    recognized would be a long and arduous process of dealing with restitution and
                    American Jewish claims; to advance our modest commercial interests in the GDR;
                    and to negotiate a consular convention with that government to protect our
                    citizens.</p>
                <p>We also sought to report back to Washington our first-hand impressions and
                    analysis of the East German scene, something previously done from an Eastern
                    Affairs Section of our mission in West Berlin and by various intelligence
                    entities. This was the other part of Hitler's Germany whose post-war status was
                    still unresolved. There were 20 Soviet divisions in the GDR, stationed there to
                    keep order and constitute the core of a force which could move through the Fulda
                    Gap one day to assault the NATO forces of Western Europe. This was the largest
                    concentration of Soviet troops anywhere in the world. At the heart of these
                    tensions lay an isolated Berlin, vital and vulnerable at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Within the limits of what could be done in a little more than two years, Cooper
                    accomplished these goals and first steps. Most important to him was to get our
                    relationship with the regime off to a correct start. “Correct” was a favorite
                    word of his, reflecting principles, a lawyer's mind, and his view of American
                    interests. Cooper never expected to produce warmth in the relationship, even
                    during a period of detente with the Soviet Union which led to a thawing of sorts
                    in other countries of Eastern Europe, and he was realistic in this appraisal.
                    Nothing important in the Allied-Soviet relationship over Berlin would budge in
                    those years, nor did we intend that this happen through our newly established
                    presence in East Germany.</p>
                <p>There had been discussions within our government as to how and where I, as charg�
                    d'affaires, should first appear in the GDR. One view held that I should drive
                    through “Checkpoint Charlie” from West Berlin, emphasizing the occupation status
                    and Allied as well as Soviet roles. The other maintained that because we had
                    recognized the German Democratic Republic, I should land in its territory from a
                    foreign capital, as would any other newly arrived diplomat. The second option
                    became the preferred one, and this is what I did, relieved at the outcome. The
                    East German protocol staff from the foreign ministry was also, in this way, able
                    to go through its protocol of greeting a new head of mission at the airport. The
                    East Germans were aware of this intra-US governmental debate through Felix Bloch
                    of our mission's staff in West Berlin, who served as liaison officer for the
                    details of my arrival, and they appreciated its outcome. (Bloch, years later,
                    was accused of spying for the Soviet Union during his assignment as DCM in
                    Vienna. I saw no evidence of such sympathies during our time together in Berlin.
                    Bloch has not been indicted.)</p>
                <p>On the arrival issue, Cooper and I had argued that, despite the nature of the
                    regime, the East Germans should be treated correctly and with a certain respect,
                    consonant with proper diplomatic behavior on our part. This may seem a small
                    point, but it was not. Communication in diplomacy takes many forms, and often
                    consists of sending signals to the other side through actions, attitudes, and
                    behavior sometimes no greater than a look of disapproval, a stiffening of one's
                    back, or a smile. My arrival arrangements carried a message about our view of
                    the quality of this new relationship, and the extent to which we intended to
                    treat the GDR as a normal partner in international affairs. The matter was
                    decided in Washington by Arthur Hartman, a man of consummate skill and
                    sensitivity in diplomacy. In a further bit of signal sending, I stopped in Bonn
                    for two days on the way for briefings at the embassy and foreign ministry, a
                    step we brought to the attention of the German press.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>At Schoenfeld Airport, I was met by the deputy chief of protocol when my plane
                    from Copenhagen landed, and driven into the city through torrential rains to my
                    temporary quarters at the Unter-den-Linden Hotel. This was a seedy place indeed,
                    but the best hotel in East Berlin at the time. Unhappily, there was a
                    photographer who took pictures as I was checking in. This led to a longish story
                    in The New York Times about the first US representative arriving in East Berlin,
                    which was not what the Coopers or I wanted. The German papers carried similar
                    stories. Our country director in Washington, David Anderson, called to tell me
                    to keep a low profile, because the Coopers were miffed. They were anxious that
                    John Sherman Cooper be known as the American who opened the US embassy in East
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>I was not authorized by the Department to present my credentials as charg� until
                    he had arrived, so there was no “official” embassy to East Germany. This
                    scenario confounded the East Germans, who could not understand why I had not
                    offered my letter of accreditation on arrival. But that is the way Cooper wanted
                    it done. I was able to rationalize the situation at the foreign ministry, which
                    did not make an issue of my unofficial presence and ignored this breach of
                    procedure. As a practical matter, I was not impeded in my ability to do what I
                    needed to, even though in diplomatic limbo. It is inconceivable that a career
                    foreign service officer would have insisted on a similar arrangement as
                    ambassador-designate. Our policy of keeping the act of recognition a low-key
                    matter in the Cold War context argued, as State recognized, for playing down the
                    ceremonial aspects in any event.</p>
                <p>I did not fly the flag on our car, and we did not fly an American flag from our
                    office building. This irritated the East Germans, who were anxious to have our
                    flag displayed as soon as possible in public attestation to our recognition of
                    their regime. One cannot exaggerate the East German regime's hunger for
                    legitimacy, the “Anerkennung der DDR,” celebrated in front- page headlines each
                    time some small African state granted recognition. We were the biggest catch of
                    all. Cooper himself would do the honors.</p>
                <p>The State Department had sent an advance team to East Germany many months before,
                    ably led by Joan Clark, then the executive director of Hartman's Bureau of
                    European Affairs. It focused on leasing office space and housing, necessary
                    spade work in preparation for our arrival. Her team was supported by our mission
                    in West Berlin. Felix Bloch was assigned as liaison officer for Joan's efforts
                    in East Berlin, and subsequent dealings with the East Germans. He later became
                    our economic counselor at the embassy. I found him rather cold, distant and
                    sardonic, but good at his work.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>By the time I arrived, modest office quarters had been acquired, but were not
                    ready to be occupied. A home for us at Mayakowskyring 50 had been rented, but I
                    could not move in because it was still unfurnished. It was a rather large and
                    brooding villa overlooking a park with a stream and ducks, wooden bridges and my
                    favorite bench. The kitchen was small, but we installed the latest equipment
                    from West Berlin. When our books and pictures arrived, along with the few items
                    of furniture Mary and I traveled with, it became more home-like but never a
                    place one could call cozy or happy.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the gray skies of long, cold winters made it seem that way. The children
                    played with their American friends from school in the flower garden and in its
                    trees, or bicycled in our village-like neighborhood. They had no East German
                    companions and none seemed to live nearby. My ten year old son Paul fell out of
                    his favorite tree one day, and I brought him back from the Army hospital in West
                    Berlin with a cast on his ankle, which made him a hero to his siblings and
                    circle of friends. Mark, on the other hand, then five, who fell on the edge of a
                    chair while tearing around the dining room, received careless attention at the
                    local and unsanitary East German hospital and has a scar on his forehead to show
                    for it.</p>
                <p>I spent the first three months in the hotel, in a run-down, small and drably
                    furnished room. The hotel served as the initial living quarters for our staff,
                    at its peak during this period numbering 23 Americans, including the Marine
                    guards. My room was at the end of a hall, and outside was a chair occupied
                    twenty-four hours a day by a uniformed East German policeman for my
                    “protection.” What we did was closely monitored by the East Germans. If we
                    wanted to have sensitive conversations, we walked the streets. When my wife and
                    children arrived in mid-December, we spent a dreary Christmas at the
                    Unter-den-Linden.</p>
                <p>Next to arrive after me were James and Aniko Gaal Weiner. Jim was our
                    administrative counselor and therefore a key man for us all. His East German
                    point of contact was one Dr. Loeffler, who presided over the Dienstleistungsamt,
                    or Diplomatic Services Agency, to which we had to turn for housing, office
                    space, and local employees such as drivers, household staff, and embassy clerks.
                    In keeping with the regime's satisfaction with our presence, Loeffler was as
                    helpful as he could be.</p>
                <p>Aniko, new to the Foreign Service, was a star. Hungarian-born, elegant and
                    artistic by nature, she worked tirelessly to help people settle in, added color
                    to the decor of our three office suites which then constituted the chancery, and
                    became a valued friend and helpmate to Lorraine Cooper. Typical of her
                    priorities was to work with the Marine gunnery sergeant and, with purchases from
                    the many stylish shops of West Berlin, brighten up and make a home out of the
                    Marine quarters in the muddy Leipzigerstrasse, a monolithic and aesthetically
                    bereft mass housing project adjacent to the Berlin wall, and still under
                    construction, where she and Jim, and Cooper's secretary Trudie Musson, also
                    lived.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Soon after my arrival we were assigned a communications officer. Until the
                    embassy moved several years later to its permanent chancery, where there would
                    be a communications center, one of his responsibilities at the end of the day
                    was to take a sealed pouch of telegrams and diplomatic correspondence through a
                    checkpoint to West Berlin for electronic transmission by USBER's communicators
                    in the US Mission on the Clayallee. In the morning, he would again take an
                    embassy car, drive through a checkpoint, and pick up messages that had arrived
                    during the night.</p>
                <p>One evening early on, I had written a telegram that was ready to be sent from
                    West Berlin, and told our communicator, Bob Walker, I would take it myself
                    because I needed to be there that night anyway. Bob drove me to USBER, where I
                    left the telegram off and then went on to dinner with friends. Afterwards, I
                    took a West Berlin taxi to “Checkpoint Charlie,” which was as far as it could
                    go. By now it was raining furiously, and I had not brought an umbrella. The walk
                    back to my hotel on the other side of the wall was about five long and gloomy
                    blocks through streets in a bombed-out section near Hitler's bunker that were
                    deserted and dimly lit. Soon, I was so wet that water ran down the back of my
                    neck and squished in my shoes. Far from feeling depressed, I recognized this was
                    one of the most satisfying moments in my fifteen years of foreign service. I
                    felt I had been born to walk this street on this night in this way, and that
                    what I was doing was worthwhile. With no one around to watch, I tried out some
                    Gene Kelly dance steps in the pouring rain.</p>
                <p>I decided that all of our staff would live in East Berlin. There had been
                    interest on the part of some to live in the west and commute through the wall
                    every day. I believed that if we were assigned to East Berlin, we should live
                    there. However, we depended on our mission in West Berlin for much of our
                    logistical support, and so we needed to cross through “Checkpoint Charlie”
                    often, which, fortunately, was located near the embassy. We did all of our
                    shopping in the west and often ate lunch there; eventually our children attended
                    American schools there; we went to theaters there; all of this was a respite
                    from the closed, dour atmosphere of East Berlin. At the end of the day, each of
                    us returned to our homes in East Berlin, and eventually it felt like coming
                    home. Despite the spartan conditions we worked and lived under, the staff
                    responded well. As the first Americans in East Berlin, we had a sense of
                    pioneering that brought us together. We supported each other and morale was
                    surprisingly high.</p>
                <p>In East Berlin, one breathed polluted air day in and day out: the brown coal
                    dust, the East European cigarette smoke, the vapors of cheap gasoline. Shops
                    were mostly empty, and people drew within themselves in public or with
                    foreigners. Physically, the city had changed little since I last visited it five
                    years earlier. There was some new construction, particularly of Soviet-style
                    apartment blocs, and some renovation and restoration of historic buildings, even
                    churches. But the atmosphere of oppression, the fear of contact with foreigners,
                    the lack of gaiety and spontaneity remained the same.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>All the while, the East Germans had access to West German television. The GDR
                    could not keep these broadcasts out of its territory. Every evening, without
                    trying to hide it, East Germans watched West German TV. They saw a way of life,
                    as it was portrayed across the wall and in other western countries, materially
                    and socially different from theirs. Yet the East Germans viewed this other
                    standard of living with ambivalence. They were shocked by the crime rates, the
                    blatant sexuality on TV, and by what appeared to them to be other signs of moral
                    decay in West German society. On the other hand, they could not help but be
                    impressed by the material opulence of West German life, and envied their German
                    cousins for that.</p>
                <p>I came to understand this ambivalence, a combination of their conservatism and
                    prudery. East Berliners, particularly those no longer young, were not sure they
                    wanted to live like their relatives on the other side of the wall. They coveted
                    the affluence—refrigerators, fancy cars, and laden stores—and were wary of the
                    life-style. Many were frightened by it, and concerned about the effects such
                    freedoms would have on their own children, who also watched television.</p>
                <p>By the 1970's, all of Berlin, in different ways, had recaptured the artistic
                    vitality for which the city was famous in the pre-war days of Berthold Brecht,
                    Kurt Weill, and Marlene Dietrich, Kaethe Kollwitz and George Grosz. Suggestions
                    of vulgarity, drunkenness and sexuality, of loneliness and despair about life
                    itself, lingered in Berlin's streets, where pock-marked building fronts with
                    dark rooms behind their lace curtains protected secrets one did not wish to
                    know. No writer of English has caught this mood better than Christopher
                    Isherwood, “Herr Issyvoo” to his landlady Frl. Schroeder, in Berlin Stories.
                    Hildegard Knef's song “Ich Hab' Noch Ein Koffer in Berlin” speaks to this
                    spirit.</p>
                <p>In the 1970s, Von Karajan led the Berlin Philharmonic and Felsenstein staged
                    breathtaking operas in East Berlin. Talented young writers, painters and actors
                    lived on both sides of the wall. The lack of artistic freedom in the East was
                    palpable. Berliners are possessed, in varying degrees, of fashion consciousness,
                    intellectual vigor, cockiness and avant garde tendencies; raunchiness and
                    maudlin sentimentality; stubbornness, courage, steadfastness and rudeness; a
                    love of freedom, dogs, asparagus, and their vaunted “Berlin air.” They sum up
                    their brassy self-confidence in the words Schnauze mit Herz, meaning big mouth
                    with a heart.</p>
                <p>Few East Berliners were routinely allowed to cross to the west. Pensioners did do
                    so because they were considered unproductive, and family visits were
                    occasionally approved by the regime in emergencies. At first, Berliners on both
                    sides saw each other from a distance, but by 1974 buildings close to the wall
                    had been razed. A “death strip” between East and West was widened and fortified
                    with watch towers, fences, and ferocious guard dogs on long leashes. What could
                    be seen most clearly from the east was the publisher Axel Springer's building in
                    West Berlin adjacent to Checkpoint Charlie, and behind it the loom of West
                    Berlin's bright lights.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>In East Berlin, houses occupied by Americans had a police booth in front manned
                    twenty-four hours a day ostensibly for protection from unspecified threats, but
                    in fact to observe who came and went. We knew we were being subjected to
                    technical surveillance, an East German specialty in the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                <p>At the embassy, we needed to take down one of the walls in our office so we could
                    install a “bubble,” a secure and shielded enclosure the size of a small
                    conference room. We explained to Herr Loeffler at the Diplomatic Services Agency
                    that because the ambassador, once he arrived, wished to have an area for staff
                    meetings, a non-retaining wall would have to be torn down to provide space. The
                    wall was reluctantly demolished by the East Germans, who surely understood our
                    reasons. Then came an unending stream of crates from West Berlin containing the
                    acoustic blocks that would constitute the “bubble.”</p>
                <p>Once it was constructed by American Seabees, we were often in this secure room
                    within a room, despite its poor and noisy ventilation. We recommended that
                    people on our staff who wanted to discuss sensitive personal matters use this
                    room to protect their privacy. Many who wished to have such conversations went
                    instead to West Berlin. We would point to the ceiling if someone was about to
                    discuss things that should not be overheard, sign language universally
                    understood behind the Iron Curtain. The British, French, and West Germans had
                    their own versions of “bubbles.” I was intrigued by the subtle differences in
                    design and furnishings: the British and French interiors had the down-at-heel
                    feeling of a gentlemen's club that had known better times. The West Germans and
                    ourselves offered a contemporary conference room ambiance. None was
                    comfortable.</p>
                <p>D Arrival of the Ambassador</p>
                <p>Ambassador and Mrs. John Sherman Cooper arrived in December of 1974 at Schoenfeld
                    Airport in East Berlin. The ambassador made a brief statement and then they were
                    sped to the Unter-den-Linden Hotel. We had asked that two rooms be joined by
                    knocking out a wall so the Coopers would have space in which to move around.
                    With the Coopers came two butlers, Thomas and Michael, Mrs. Cooper's wonderful
                    Salvadoran cook, Delia Alfaro, and her personal maid, Caroline. We housed this
                    staff in West Berlin; the Coopers settled into their dowdy, noisy, and
                    over-heated hotel with its collection of East European smells.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>On their first night, the Coopers had a quiet dinner by themselves. The next
                    afternoon, the administrative staff and I took them to the house the State
                    Department's advance team had chosen for them. It was the best they could find.
                    This turned out to be a small villa surrounded on three sides by a large
                    cemetery. It had a tiny 1930s kitchen and small rooms, none of which opened on
                    each other, and were accessible only from a cramped entrance hall. Delia, Tom,
                    and Michael looked shaken. It was entirely unsuitable for the Coopers and fell
                    far short of their expectations. Words failed Mrs. Cooper. A foreign service
                    couple would have made the adjustment, perhaps even to the cemetery. It took
                    only a few minutes, however, before the ambassador said to me: “When's the next
                    plane home?”</p>
                <p>I anticipated this reaction and had a fallback plan. We had asked the Diplomatic
                    Services Agency to show us one of their shoe box shaped houses on the diplomatic
                    compound. There were about thirty of these in a kind of Levittown for foreign
                    ambassadors. Surrounded by a high fence, they were conveniently located. Some
                    pathetic attempts at landscaping had been made, and it was not a pretty sight.
                    On the plus side, they had large kitchens, a large dining room, several bedrooms
                    and baths. They were well designed for entertaining. The outside area could
                    accommodate many guests. Had we shown one of those houses first to the Coopers,
                    we would have heard the same question about the next plane. But having seen the
                    best traditional, pre-war housing the East Germans could provide, a shoe box
                    would look better to John and Lorraine. Everything, after all, is relative.</p>
                <p>The Coopers, quite upset, asked me to join them for dinner in their room that
                    night. I described the shoe box, pro and con, and said it had great potential. I
                    suggested that Mrs. Cooper could work with the basic structure and transform its
                    appearance on the inside the way no other diplomats ever thought of doing. If
                    they would be interested, I could arrange to take them to the diplomatic
                    compound the next day so they could see the challenge for themselves. And that
                    is what happened.</p>
                <p>I could see a gleam in Mrs. Cooper's eyes the moment we entered. She was a
                    talented interior decorator and it did not take long for her to assess the
                    possibilities. Thomas was an interior designer as well as butler, and saw what
                    might be done. Delia loved the kitchen. Lorraine transformed that shoe box into
                    an entirely different place. She put tapestries on the walls, borrowed paintings
                    from the National Gallery in Washington with its director Carter Brown's help,
                    and strategically placed miniature orange trees we had procured from West
                    Berlin. The East Germans were dazzled by this endorsement of their handiwork.
                    More importantly, the Coopers were happy in their new home. Lorraine's
                    imagination and determination got us all past a large hurdle.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>I mention the housing crisis because so much of my time was spent on matters like
                    this, something to be expected in opening a new post. Our mission in West Berlin
                    did its utmost to accommodate and support us. And what an asset it was to have
                    West Berlin on the other side of this divided city! Our well versed
                    administrative officer, Jim Weiner, however, always had a difficult time of it
                    with Mrs. Cooper. Through her husband, she regularly tested the limits of our
                    government's procurement policies.</p>
                <p>The matter of the wooden toilet seats makes the point. Lorraine had heard from
                    her friend, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, that wooden toilet seats were good in
                    winter because they did not get as cold as the other kind. So she insisted on
                    wooden toilet seats, and one day the ambassador put these on a list of items he
                    wanted ordered for his residence. I told him we and Washington had been as
                    responsive as possible to his many requests. Wooden toilet seats were very
                    expensive. If we sent a telegram to the State Department with such a request, it
                    would not be long before some ne'r-do-well would leak it to The Washington Post.
                    I suggested that if wooden toilet seats were needed, they should be bought
                    privately. I never heard about them again. Lorraine was visibly annoyed.</p>
                <p>I walked a thin line in East Berlin. The State Department thought I was too
                    supportive of the Coopers and too willing an accomplice in their demands. The
                    Coopers, on the other hand, thought I was excessively cautious, too much a
                    Washington bureaucrat. Privately, however, Cooper made it clear to me he wanted
                    to be kept on the straight and narrow path of compliance with the rules.</p>
                <p>Jim Weiner met his Waterloo with Mrs. Cooper in the incident of the air
                    freshener. This is a liquid poured with an eye-dropper into a narrow, grooved
                    ring that is placed on light bulbs in lamps to get rid of such smells as
                    cigarette smoke. It is scented and emits light smoke when subjected to the heat
                    of the bulb. Jim had never seen one of these before. On the evening in question,
                    during a large, elegant reception at the residence in the diplomatic compound,
                    at which arriving guests were announced at the top of the stairs by the butler,
                    Jim spotted this smoke, and shouted “FIRE!” Pushing his way past the orange
                    trees and through the guests, he smartly yanked the lamp cord out of the wall.
                    When his gaze eventually met Lorraine's, however, he realized that, somehow, he
                    had sized up the situation incorrectly.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>On issues of policy and the bilateral relationship, Cooper did not intend to go
                    further with the East Germans than Washington was willing to accept. But he had
                    differences with State over tactics. Cooper did not appreciate guidance on how
                    he should carry out his instructions. He felt tactics were his business, and I
                    supported this view. Our relations with the State Department and embassy in the
                    West German capital of Bonn were unavoidably sensitive and complicated. There
                    was in Washington a certain awe of the politically prominent and respected
                    Cooper, and concern that we in East Berlin might stray from the well trodden
                    paths of Allied practices with initiatives of our own and cause trouble. As
                    Cooper's deputy and the ranking foreign service officer, I felt the breath of
                    Washington on the back of my neck more than anyone else. Because we had no
                    serious substantive differences within the US government over East Germany, it
                    was fairly easy to keep our embassy on a steady course.</p>
                <p>The Western Allies, West Germans, and ourselves worked closely on Berlin issues.
                    It was Bonn that carried the major share of dealing with the East Germans. Their
                    interests were more numerous and immediate than anyone else's. This placed great
                    importance on staying in close touch with our West German colleagues in Berlin,
                    so we could give Washington well founded reporting on what they thought and did.
                    Had there been malevolence, personal jealousies, lack of competence in any of
                    the Allied embassies, or in the West German mission in East Berlin, we would
                    have had serious problems. None of this happened.</p>
                <p>E Relations with the Soviets During Detente</p>
                <p>The years of 1972 through 1979 were the Cold War's period of detente, or easing
                    of tensions between the United States and Soviet Union. Detente occurred because
                    it suited the interests of both powers at the same time. This thaw in the Cold
                    War did not diminish any underlying antagonisms, but permitted a change in the
                    quality of relations on the surface, as well as progress toward peace. Detente
                    was the product of Kissinger's thinking, put into practice by Brezhnev and
                    Nixon. It provided the Soviet economy a respite from defense spending and
                    allowed its regime to focus on issues elsewhere, as in China and, to its
                    eventual regret, Afghanistan. In East Berlin, the Soviets replaced Walter
                    Ulbricht, an opponent of detente, by Erich Honecker in 1971.</p>
                <p>Detente produced the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), and the initially
                    controversial Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) whose
                    Final Act was signed in Helsinki in August of 1975. This agreement legitimized
                    the post-war boundaries of Eastern Europe, but permitted a formal monitoring of
                    the human rights of people in the region with benefits to us the Soviets had not
                    anticipated and the West exploited. In their communiqu� at the end of a North
                    Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels in December, 1974 the ministers specified
                    that success of detente in Europe was linked to implementation the 1972
                    Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>The joint space flight Apollo-Soyuz, in which spacecraft from the two superpowers
                    docked in outer space in July, 1975 symbolized the benefits of cooperation
                    between the United States and the Soviet Union. Berlin, where US and Soviet
                    forces stood toe to toe, functioned as a barometer in the relationship. It came
                    naturally to us who served there during detente to reflect and reinforce this
                    newly changed atmosphere in our statements and diplomatic relationships.</p>
                <p>The East German regime found itself left out of this process. They were not
                    actors in detente, but spectators who must have felt uneasy about a shift in
                    Cold War politics that warmed relations, at least superficially, between their
                    protectors and ourselves. It is not too much to say that during this period
                    Soviet Ambassador Piotr Abrasimov in East Berlin permitted a few visible rays of
                    light to fall between himself and the GDR's party general secretary Erich
                    Honecker. Abrasimov, for example, greeted Cooper warmly at public receptions,
                    holding up the receiving line for all to notice.</p>
                <p>Nowhere was diplomacy more intricate. With ourselves, the Soviets, and the GDR's
                    leadership at each of three corners, diplomacy in Berlin was a continuing,
                    subtly balanced process of triangulation. US interests had been driven by global
                    considerations in the Cold War, our quadripartite treaty obligations, ties to
                    our Western Allies and NATO, and the primacy of our relations with Bonn. The
                    Soviets shared Cold War and treaty responsibilities, but had created the German
                    Democratic Republic as a pseudo-sovereign, puppet entity in their zone of
                    occupation, thereby greatly complicating the picture. The GDR's corner in the
                    triangle was a largely powerless place for a pawn between the two antagonists,
                    and a prot�g� of one of them. The regime, Berlin's diplomats, and even the
                    general population watched with fascination as this temporary Cold War
                    rapprochement between the two giants played itself out on the world scene and,
                    more immediately, in the confrontational setting of Berlin itself. What would
                    this lead to?</p>
                <p>Ambassador Piotr Abrasimov had been assigned to East Berlin for more than ten
                    years and was proud of the fact that he spoke no German. When we began to see
                    him socially in 1974, he did not conceal his unhappiness at being kept so long
                    in Berlin. He did not respect or like Germans, as his asides in conversation
                    soon made obvious. This reflected a Soviet attitude Abrasimov, in the spirit of
                    detente and social conviviality, felt he could impart to us, believing that as
                    allies against the Germans in World War II, we would agree. We did not, but
                    didn't say so. Triangulation, again.</p>
                <p>Abrasimov and Cooper went out of their ways to develop a cordial relationship,
                    and this proved quite easy to do. Cooper was not a naturally effusive person,
                    but he and Abrasimov, also not effusive, soon warmed to each other. The Soviet
                    deputy chief of mission was Anatoly Gromyko, son of the Soviet foreign minister,
                    who was posted to East Berlin shortly before my arrival. He was my counterpart
                    in many discussions.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>The Abrasimovs began to invite the Coopers, the Groves, and the Gromykos, Anatoly
                    and Valya, to their residence for dinner. These were held in the private
                    quarters upstairs, which were far more intimate than the cavernous and formal
                    areas below. The furnishings bore a flavor of late 19th century European
                    elegance in a faded, gilded, overstuffed way. Russians favored this style, which
                    probably seemed imperial to them. Huge paintings from the school of Socialist
                    Realism hung incongruously from the walls. Their building, covering an entire
                    city block, served as chancery and residence, and was of post-war construction.
                    It had an intimidating exterior meant to underscore the authority of its
                    occupants to one and all.</p>
                <p>The Abrasimovs lived comfortably, as did the Gromykos. They had efficient
                    household staffs, and all the food and liquor from West Berlin they might want.
                    Dishes at their dinners were excellent, and the meals were served in elaborate
                    courses, in the Russian fashion. Caviar seemed to come out of buckets. Their
                    hospitality was generous and sincere. Kissinger allegedly said in Moscow, “I
                    will do anything for caviar!” a weakness I have always understood.</p>
                <p>The most festive occasion was the Abrasimovs' invitation to a dinner celebrating
                    the Apollo-Soyuz docking in space on the day after the event itself, in mid-July
                    of 1975. Eight of us sat down to a colorfully decorated table that might have
                    been prepared for a birthday party, but here the theme was outer space and
                    spacecrafts, not an easy one for the embassy's staff to grapple with. After all,
                    how best to represent space? Anatoly Gromyko proposed we sign and exchange the
                    typed menu cards, and we cheerfully did so. There was a hollow ring at times to
                    the toasts and joviality, because the basic strains in US-Soviet relations,
                    among them the Berlin wall a few meters away, remained unchanged, something we
                    all recognized. Nevertheless, the corniness of the decorations and pride of our
                    hosts in them, the elaborate plans to please American guests, were touching. Our
                    moments of forced gaiety reminded me of well meant efforts to cheer up a sick
                    patient. If occasionally our voices were too loud, these were the benefits and
                    contradictions of detente.</p>
                <p>I particularly recall Cooper's explanation of our 1976 elections to Abrasimov. We
                    were at dinner one night during which the conversation turned to these
                    elections. Cooper sat back and described the US and our democratic processes
                    with great eloquence. In his soft voice and personal way, he talked about
                    Somerset, Kentucky, where he was born, his experiences there as a judge, the
                    political life and concerns of near-poor Pulaski County. He described elements
                    of the 1976 elections: the personalities involved, the issues being debated.
                    Abrasimov was captivated. He obviously had never heard a lucid explanation of
                    our political system from someone deeply versed in that system. It was an
                    extraordinary moment of outreach by Cooper. Abrasimov made no attempt to change
                    the subject, but sat as engrossed as we all were around the table. It was a
                    moving experience because Cooper found words that reached the souls of his
                    listeners, among them three proud Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>This is what a good ambassador can do to explain his country, particularly in
                    circumstances as difficult as East Berlin at the time. After a few halfhearted
                    comparisons, Abrasimov gave up trying to praise the Soviet system. It was not
                    that Cooper had made a convert of him; he hadn't. Rather, Abrasimov and even
                    Gromyko had gained new insights and respect for the US in ways they had not
                    expected.</p>
                <p>We usually reported on such social affairs to Washington, although I doubt there
                    is a record of this particular evening. None of us foresaw the consequences for
                    communism in the late 1980s. We had few expectations of even modest change in
                    that system. But there is always the first step in a long journey, and the
                    change in tenor of our relationships in East Berlin during detente gave us small
                    hope for a better future. Murderous incidents at the wall did not decrease; the
                    US-Soviet relationship did not blossom into lasting friendship. But it was clear
                    to us that Abrasimov had registered a change in his assessment of Americans.
                    Detente finally ended with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on Christmas Day
                    of 1979.</p>
                <p>Gromyko and I had a bantering relationship. He was a vain man, a Marxist
                    ideologue conscious of his status as the son of the foreign minister. He was
                    also loquacious, pompous, and a braggart. Anatoly was not so secret an admirer
                    of the US: he regularly wore cowboy boots, which amazed me. Valya Gromyko was
                    glamorous and westernized. She was his second wife, and had an engaging streak
                    of rebelliousness. Valya liked to go to West Berlin occasionally with my wife,
                    whose origins were Russian, to look at the latest fashions and buy perfume. She
                    was flirtatious and a smooth dancer. I liked her.</p>
                <p>Anatoly was not a person I could feel close to or trust. On occasion, we invited
                    the Gromykos to our garden to grill hamburgers. When out of sight of his Soviet
                    colleagues, Anatoly fancied himself an expatriate from, say, Chevy Chase,
                    Maryland. He strutted around in his boots and loud sport shirts and spoke with
                    an exaggerated American accent, believing himself to be truly one of the boys.
                    He had a lot of exposure to the US and the western world, although nominally an
                    expert on African affairs. There were always unstated limits to the closeness of
                    our relationship. I saw Anatoly briefly a year after Berlin, on a trip to Moscow
                    where he was director of the Soviet Africa Institute. I called on him at his
                    office and brought a small present for Valya. Anatoly did not invite me to his
                    home. We no longer had the give-and-take we developed in East Berlin, which was
                    not surprising, based, as it was, on the convenience and opportunities of the
                    moment.</p>
                <p>F Working in East Germany</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Our embassy was assigned two officials for regular contacts with the East German
                    government. One was the gnome-like Dr. Hans-Otto Geyer, who headed the American
                    hemisphere desk of the foreign ministry, and the other was his immediate
                    superior, under secretary Horst Grunert, who later became an effective
                    ambassador to Washington. I saw the former, Cooper the latter. In Washington,
                    too, the State Department kept East German contacts below senior levels. We were
                    asked to request appointments with other government officials through Dr. Geyer.
                    We were also asked to submit guest lists in advance of our social functions if
                    they included East Germans, and to cite the subjects to be discussed. We
                    complied only to the extent of inviting East German officials through the
                    Ministry's protocol office.</p>
                <p>Geyer and other GDR officials were correct and courteous, but distant.
                    Periodically, we would be treated to a pro forma lecture about the wonders and
                    successes of communism, but this was an exception; our relations with East
                    German officials were businesslike. Interested in promoting our presence, they
                    tried to accommodate us and not offend us. They sought visible rapprochement as
                    a propaganda objective, and understood that preaching ideology would not make a
                    dent on us and might even have a negative impact. Occasionally, Geyer would
                    offer some barbed comments about the failures of capitalism. He was a hardline,
                    believing Marxist, stubborn, and a Prussian to boot, which made him formidable
                    as an adversary. But he had his sense of humor, a sly smile connoting
                    appreciation of our position, and we managed to get along satisfactorily with
                    this granite, school-masterish personality who sprayed saliva between the spaces
                    in his teeth.</p>
                <p>Doctor Geyer, of all things, fancied himself a bourbon connoisseur, a fact of
                    which we took due note. At Christmas, we would give liquor or American
                    cigarettes to East Germans who worked closely with us. Our best bourbon went to
                    Dr. Geyer. No one ever refused gifts; we were careful to make sure we could not
                    be accused of passing bribes, adhering to the pattern of gift-giving which had
                    become acceptable in the diplomatic community. Some of our non-Allied diplomatic
                    colleagues, however, engaged in lavish greasing of the skids in the spirit of
                    Christmas.</p>
                <p>In December, 1974 we at the embassy began preparing our children for the spring
                    semester at the American schools in West Berlin. This would entail crossing
                    through the wall twice each day in a small school bus we had acquired. The
                    drivers were East Germans given permission to enter West Berlin. One of these,
                    young and brash Herr Kuenast, was fired by the Diplomatic Services Agency for
                    regularly returning from the west with pornographic magazines for resale.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>We needed some form of identification for our children, other than their
                    diplomatic passports. We had first graders who could not be expected to hold on
                    to their passports, show them at the checkpoints, and bring them home every
                    afternoon without losing them. Or so we thought. It took NATO, London, Paris,
                    Bonn, and Washington several months to accept our proposal of a laminated card,
                    worn on a beaded chain, which would not compromise allied rights and practices
                    in Berlin. The issue of children's IDs affected children of all three Allied
                    powers who traveled back and forth, and was therefore a matter to be resolved in
                    the same way by the three occupying powers. It also had to be accepted by the
                    Soviets in practice, as well as the East Germans, if unofficially. Never did a
                    child misplace a diplomatic passport or ID, a remarkable achievement in
                    exercising responsibility. I suspect my children still remember our firm words
                    of instruction to them about their passports and cards.</p>
                <p>The social scene in East Berlin was an active one among non-communist diplomats.
                    We were kept busier than we wished; other opportunities for social life in East
                    Berlin were limited. We saw the same people, most of whom were interested in us
                    as sources of information, or were fishing for invitations to the now fabled
                    Cooper residence with its orange trees. There were some ambassadors who were
                    extraordinarily well informed. They became important contacts for us because of
                    our limited access to East Germans. Foremost among these were the
                    representatives of Sweden and Pakistan. Diplomats from East European countries
                    kept their distance, and we never had productive relations with them. They felt
                    watched by each other, the Soviets, and their GDR hosts. When a large social
                    function such as the Fourth of July came along, they would cheerfully enjoy our
                    food and drink. We managed these contacts carefully.</p>
                <p>The United States did not establish diplomatic relations with the People's
                    Republic of China until January, 1979. The Chinese had of course been
                    represented in East Berlin for many years. When we encountered their diplomats
                    at various functions, we followed the practice approved by the State Department
                    of exchanging greetings or handshakes, but not lingering to speak or discuss
                    anything beyond the weather. It was surprising to me, therefore, in August, 1975
                    when the Chinese charg� came up to me at a large East German function at a time
                    when I, too, was acting as charg�, and asked me in excellent German whether I
                    could join him for a cup of tea and a brief conversation at his embassy. After
                    thanking him, I answered that I would reply shortly.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>The State Department cabled back that I should accept. My driver was astonished
                    when I gave him the address, and the dutiful East German guards in their booths
                    outside must have been equally so. I waited for my host's message as we sipped
                    tea in Oriental surroundings and talked about life in Berlin. He had been there
                    for a long time, and said German affairs would be his life's work. Finally, he
                    got to the point. Former President Nixon, who had resigned from office in August
                    of 1974, was considering a private visit to China. The charg� asked me to report
                    back on behalf of his government that Mr. Nixon was welcome and would be well
                    received. Why the Chinese picked Berlin as the channel for this message remains
                    a mystery. They may have recognized that Cooper, a political appointee, was a
                    friend of President Ford and knew Nixon, and that his embassy might be the most
                    direct way to get a political message through.</p>
                <p>I had another encounter with the Chinese deputy chief of mission some months
                    later, in January 1976. Premier Zhou En-lai, who with President Nixon negotiated
                    the opening to China, had died of cancer. Finding my interlocutor again at one
                    of Mr. Honecker's grand receptions, I shook his hand and said the world had lost
                    a great statesman. He thanked me with tears in his eyes.</p>
                <p>At the top of the East German government's agenda in Washington was promotion of
                    its exports. A concomitant goal was to gain respectability in our eyes. They
                    sought to establish an image of friendliness, accessibility, and charm. In this
                    view, the Berlin wall became “a necessary and not unusual international border
                    demarcation.” Good relations between us, they said, were to be expected. When
                    Grunert became the GDR's ambassador to Washington, he made a good impression
                    with his bonhomie, well-cut suits, and frequent entertaining. No one was asking
                    him to submit his guest lists to the State Department for approval, either.</p>
                <p>We viewed ourselves in East Berlin as the post-war embassy in the “other”
                    Germany, a part of central Europe not directly covered by American diplomats
                    since 1941. Negotiations for a consular convention to protect our citizens were
                    successfully concluded by a State Department team of lawyers and consular
                    experts, with myself at its head. Two sticking points concerned issues of
                    notification of arrests, and access to prisoners. I found the East German side,
                    in these first negotiations since relations were established, formal and proper
                    almost to a fault, but forthcoming and willing to engage in banter if they
                    thought things were going well. I learned the benefits of understanding the
                    other side's language and their discussions among themselves, and of taking
                    advantage of time devoted to translation to think ahead to our next round of
                    tactics and responses when the discussion shifted to us. The East German
                    consular experts seemed not particularly aware that I spoke German.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>We also set about finding and registering American citizens, for whom we had
                    consular responsibility. They were few in number. Our small USIS operation
                    sought to explain America and its values. This “propaganda” became the most
                    sensitive area of our activities, one Dr. Geyer found threatening, and sought to
                    constrain and disparage. We urged the GDR to vote with us on certain UN
                    resolutions and on other issues in multilateral diplomacy. Our interests
                    converged sometimes, and we strengthened our relations by discussing
                    multilateral affairs in depth. We followed the Law of the Sea convention closely
                    with them, on many of whose key issues we, the GDR, and the Soviets held similar
                    views.</p>
                <p>When we raised questions about untended Jewish cemeteries in Berlin, the East
                    Germans were forthcoming. We had several concerns in this matter: burial
                    records, some of them of Americans; replacement of tombstones which had been
                    removed or vandalized; and responsibility for cemetery maintenance. We also
                    became involved in property restitution issues. These cases were always complex,
                    and tended to be precedent-setting. Progress was extremely slow.</p>
                <p>I have described elsewhere the isolation we felt while we were living in West
                    Berlin from 1965-69. It was more pronounced in East Berlin ten years later. We
                    were able to travel into East Germany, after obtaining the necessary clearances
                    from Dr. Geyer if we were going to stay overnight. On day trips, we could drive
                    wherever we wanted, except in restricted areas, and were always observed by the
                    local Volpos, or People's Police, who uninhibitedly wrote down our license
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>The countryside was in a time warp. I had known Germany nearly forty years
                    earlier when I lived with my parents in Hamburg for several years as a boy. By
                    the mid-70s, it appeared that little outside the cities had changed. Many roads
                    were old and narrow, steeply cambered with ditches along their sides, the farm
                    houses run down. I remember a tranquil softness, as in farmland paintings by
                    impressionists in the late nineteenth century in which dark-earthed open fields
                    were worked by women bending down in their bulky clothes to reach the soil.</p>
                <p>Arriving at a village, we noticed the two or three stores that had been
                    constructed recently, with their glass fronts and neon lights. They seemed
                    jarringly out of place. The acronym for government-run food stores was an
                    astonishing “HO-HO-HO.” Municipal buildings, such as the city hall, police
                    headquarters and schools, were usually of more recent vintage. Except for
                    automobiles and these modern touches, the villages could not have been much
                    different seventy years earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Farmers, who grew their own food, ate better than their city kin, but the
                    standard of living, while far higher than in the USSR, was not much different
                    from Poland, and perhaps slightly below Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Our
                    conspicuous diplomatic license plates were red with white lettering. People
                    would go out of their way to avoid contact with us, fearing the STASI secret
                    police would make trouble for them. We called on nervous and unforthcoming city
                    officials, after appointments had been arranged by the foreign ministry. We
                    participated in the Leipzig fair in 1975, the first full year after US-GDR
                    relations were established. This step was a success, with Honecker making a
                    highly publicized point of visiting our modest booth of trade catalogues and
                    chatting for the cameras with Cooper. Recognition was being burnished by a touch
                    of surface friendship.</p>
                <p>Erich Honecker was head of state and general secretary of the Socialist Unity
                    Party (SED), the successor to Walter Ulbricht and architect of the Berlin wall.
                    He was smoother, more worldly and flexible, and less doctrinaire than the
                    squeaky-voiced Ulbricht, and in a sense he was therefore a more dangerous
                    adversary. If our infrequent official and personal relations with East German
                    officials such as Dr. Hans-Otto Geyer, the North American desk officer, can be
                    described as two-dimensional and unfailingly formal with few human flashes, our
                    ties with Erich Honecker himself, whom I saw only at official functions, were
                    one-dimensional. His face, set on such occasions into parodies of affability
                    that were out of character, was dominated by his glasses, behind which cold,
                    calculating and unfriendly eyes stared out. Everything about him was tensely
                    self-controlled. Cooper, with his instinct to reach out to others in public
                    life, found Honecker unchanged in their few private discussions, from which I
                    was excluded although Honecker had members of his own staff present and provided
                    the interpreter.</p>
                <p>Honecker's fawning, sycophantic relationship with Soviet Ambassador Abrasimov on
                    public occasions, including protestations of gratitude for the Soviet presence
                    in his country, was disgusting to many in his audience. I have no doubt
                    Abrasimov held this obsequious toady in contempt. In our many private
                    conversations with Abrasimov, he never had a generous word for the GDR or its
                    leaders. Not that he pointedly disparaged them; he didn't seem to find them
                    worth discussing.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>The GDR was a state that never existed in any respectable sense, and whose
                    sovereignty was severely curtailed. A creation of the Soviet Union, it dissolved
                    of its own accord as its patron state disintegrated. When this occurred,
                    four-power agreements first concluded at the end of World War II and
                    subsequently modified were firmly in place. The unwavering commitment of the
                    three Allied powers in Berlin, insisting on the exercise of every legal right,
                    holding out for dreary decades against assaults of nearly every kind from
                    Moscow, kept intact the basis for the most profound peaceful revolution in
                    modern Europe when the wall came down in 1989. The tedious, repetitive and
                    patient exercise of Allied rights, so often boring and seemingly without
                    imagination, paid off in the end. So did diplomatic negotiations among the
                    Allies, Soviets and West Germans (and the “small steps” of West Berlin's
                    authorities) in such understandings as the West German-Soviet Treaty of August,
                    1970 and the Berlin Agreement of September, 1971.</p>
                <p>I had an extraordinary experience when, as director of the Foreign Service
                    Institute, I returned to East Berlin fifteen years later, in 1989, with FSI's
                    Senior Seminar group. The wall had just come down, and the Cold War was over.
                    Our embassy had arranged a luncheon briefing with several former East German
                    officials; one of these had been a young man working for Geyer whom I had known
                    well. I was astonished to see him again, and asked what he and Dr. Geyer thought
                    of the Americans in 1974, as Cooper and I established our embassy. He said we
                    were always correct and open, and that Cooper was very much liked. Our
                    “correctness” in official relations had been appreciated. But, he added, he and
                    his colleagues could never understand why we called ourselves the “American
                    embassy to the German Democratic Republic,” rather than “in.” Despite all the
                    explanations we had provided, he alleged that the East Germans did not
                    understand this phrasing. The Allied rationale, I explained, was that if we had
                    said “in” this would have implied that East Berlin was part of the German
                    Democratic Republic, rather than part of a unified city under post-war
                    occupation by the four victorious powers.</p>
                <p>He remained politely unconvinced and I think sincerely so. He thought, in 1989,
                    that things would not go well for East Germans. He was still in the foreign
                    ministry, but did not expect that when the two Germanys were unified, which
                    happened the following year, East German diplomats would have much of a future
                    in the new government, and he was right.</p>
                <p>G The Berlin Wall</p>
                <p>The Berlin wall was an ever present reality, a physical reminder of the East-West
                    split which took on an eerie existence of its own. One spoke of the wall with
                    casual familiarity. It became common, where choice existed, to capitalize the
                    “W,” giving the structure a kind of respectability and legitimacy. The wall
                    slashed through the center of a once bustling and thriving city. It was not only
                    the wall itself that had a dampening effect, but also the shabby areas abutting
                    it, the empty lots along the Leipzigerstrasse and other streets where anything
                    that might serve as a hiding place had been razed. It truly was a hideous
                    sight.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>While we were in East Berlin, the GDR, with Soviet acquiescence, undertook what
                    it cynically called a “wall beautification” program. The Neues Deutschland party
                    newspaper printed, day after day, photographs of “improved and beautified”
                    areas, describing the wall as a normal barrier between sovereign entities, with
                    normal traffic crossing points such as their side of Checkpoint Charlie. Shrubs
                    and flowers were planted. They got rid of the zig-zag approaches to the
                    checkpoints, emphasizing, they said, courtesy to visitors. Border guards were
                    portrayed as extending hospitality to those who had come to make the crossing.
                    Such propaganda not only lauded the wall's beautification and its normalcy, but
                    its efficiency. The GDR placed large rollers on top of the wall further to
                    impede escape for anyone who tried to climb over. Once in a while, one of the
                    GDR organs would run a human interest story about a border guard and his dog,
                    man and his best friend.</p>
                <p>Men and women who tried to escape were called traitors. Escape attempts were
                    mentioned in the papers only when witnessed by many people, and therefore widely
                    known. The GDR could not conceal major attempts or shootings, since western
                    television, which played up these incidents, was watched throughout East
                    Germany. The East German media gave an escape attempt two or three lines on the
                    back page, where it was depicted as the act of someone breaking the law who had
                    suffered the consequences of transgression.</p>
                <p>The wall was more than a physical barrier. Its existence changed the city,
                    separating people of the same parents into two different ways of life. Each
                    recognized what was happening to the other. Many East Germans began to take
                    pride in their hopelessly incompetent system, despite their envy of material
                    standards in the west. They found in their own spartan existence a socialist's
                    sense of satisfaction in the leveling nature, and what they believed to be the
                    security, of their system in such matters as health care, schooling, and
                    pensions. We concluded that if the wall were to come down, there would not be a
                    wholesale rush to the west. Younger people and professionals would migrate to
                    West Germany, where opportunities were greater, but most others would stay, or
                    return voluntarily to the east after visits and shopping sprees in the west. And
                    that is what happened.</p>
                <p>Many East Germans found it convenient to take the high ground in comparing the
                    two systems and a surprising number, as we now know, viewed theirs as superior.
                    Government propaganda seized on decadence and corruption in the west as a
                    central, strident theme. People were unable to criticize the GDR openly or vote
                    for anyone but Honecker, and many sensed that the STASI secret police had
                    invaded their lives and set informer upon informer. Corruption in their own
                    government was concealed from view, but many knew of it. And yet, they felt
                    their values and stability threatened by what was going on in the west.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>What they saw was western television. In the late 1960s, they watched Rudi
                    Dutschke and students at West Berlin's Free University create anarchy and
                    celebrate free love, men with long hair playing rock music. We have forgotten
                    what a powerful symbol of rebellion long hair on men amounted to. The staid and
                    prudish East German burgher living outside Berlin remained appalled by the
                    morals and crime rates of the west. If there was one thing he expected from
                    government, it was social order.</p>
                <p>Much of the west's opulence was considered vulgar. In this view West Germany's
                    “economic miracle” amounted to crass materialism, and West Germans had lost
                    their moral bearings. Most East Germans did not wish to be like their western
                    cousins; if they were to rise to western economic standards, they would do so by
                    their own means, protecting their own values. The universal envy of East
                    Germans, however, was the freedom of West Germans to travel.</p>
                <p>There was one particularly sinister aspect of the wall: it brain-washed us all.
                    People believed the wall would stand for years, and accepted its presence as an
                    immutable fact. It stood as a permanent monument to the tyranny of a government
                    over its people. I was all but certain in the mid-1970s that the wall would not
                    fall in my lifetime, and I know of no one who thought otherwise. “Mr. Gorbachev,
                    open this Gate...Tear down this wall,” Reagan demanded in Berlin in 1987, but no
                    one seriously believed the Russian leader would permit this to happen.</p>
                <p>This shows how the world had adjusted to the Cold War as a struggle without
                    foreseeable end. The west accepted its costs and global nature as if the Soviet
                    Union and Russian people could bear, indefinitely, the increasing strains
                    between their domestic needs and military expenditures. Detente did not last.
                    There were noble and heroic exceptions in the actions of many individuals, but
                    it seemed that to struggle for freedom under communism was to grapple with the
                    unattainable. We believed the best way to deal with the Soviet system and Soviet
                    expansionism was to contain them, and tolerate such actions as the construction
                    of Berlin's wall as not threatening basic western interests.</p>
                <p>In hindsight, we should have had a more accurate understanding of the internal
                    dynamic of the Soviet Union, a major failure of western intelligence and
                    analysis. Future historians, and documents of both sides now coming to light,
                    can show us opportunities missed. While I doubt a better or more enduring
                    framework than containment could have been devised to avoid a nuclear war and
                    achieve the ends we sought, a question remains: did the Cold War need to last
                    this long?</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>I was traveling in Tunisia in November of 1989, when the wall was opened. In the
                    newspaper delivered one morning to my hotel room with breakfast, I saw a banner
                    headline announcing the event. My French must have deserted me, I thought. This
                    headline makes no sense.” I understood the words, but could not believe my eyes.
                    It was true, and though I was far from concerns about Berlin at the time, I was
                    deeply moved. Having experienced life on both sides of the wall, it was a
                    stunning moment for me. I realized the Cold War would soon end, and that freedom
                    had triumphed over despotism. Just as the building of a Wall had symbolic
                    meaning, so did its crumbling.</p>
                <p>It was disappointing that our government remained largely silent at this time. A
                    statement about the force of freedom was needed from our president. The Bush
                    administration's initial caution was driven by a desire not to gloat or provoke
                    reactions from the East but I found its silence at such a breathtaking time
                    inadequate. We led the west in the Cold War, and were tongue-tied at its
                    end.</p>
                <p>Like others who knew Germany, I recognized that the transition period would not
                    be easy. Perhaps the most courageous act of the West German government since its
                    creation in 1948 is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision, when the wall opened, to
                    exchange one East German mark for one Western. The cost to West Germans was even
                    greater than he expected. To this day, the unification process between the
                    eastern and western parts of Germany continues painfully and slowly and is by no
                    means complete. Psychological adjustments, in particular, take a long time for
                    people on both sides.</p>
                <p>I hope that someday soon I will be able to walk slowly through the Brandenburg
                    Gate, taking time to think and remember.</p>
                <p>H The Nazi Past</p>
                <p>Germans still struggle with their Nazi past, although I never met anyone on
                    either side of the wall who admitted to having been a Nazi. From my boyhood
                    years in Hamburg I knew differently. In a way, adjustment to the experience of
                    Nazism was made easier for East Germans. The GDR's leaders themselves, men like
                    Ulbricht and Honecker, were prewar communists in Berlin who had suffered in Nazi
                    prisons. Their condemnation of fascism was heartfelt. With their Soviet
                    occupiers, they seized every opportunity to remind people in the GDR of what had
                    happened in Germany under Hitler, and during a war Soviet forces were portrayed
                    as having won largely on their own.</p>
                <p>The most striking street theater on Unter-den-Linden, East Berlin's main
                    thoroughfare, took place at the GDR's memorial to the victims of fascism,
                    guarded by their soldiers whose very goose-stepping recalled fascism. A gigantic
                    statue dedicated to fallen Soviet fighters towered over the Russian cemetery
                    near the heart of East Berlin. It was a forceful reminder of Nazism and the
                    costs of a war like no other in history.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Somber commemorations of World War II victories staged by the Russians and the
                    East German regime drove these points home year after year. Paradoxically,
                    leaders of the regime, themselves German and therefore among the vanquished,
                    were able, because of their political pasts as victims of fascism, to side with
                    the victors and do so with sincerity. They believed they, too, had triumphed
                    over fascism. Large numbers of East Germans, particularly in older generations
                    of Berliners, were dedicated communists and their condemnation of Nazism was
                    genuine. Berlin, the Red City, had been the Communist Party center when the
                    Nazis came to power. For other East Germans these rituals and symbols became a
                    form of absolution, and a convenient way, sometimes, of moving on.</p>
                <p>The smaller number of commemorations in West Germany was widely publicized, and
                    through clever GDR propaganda had a subtle psychological effect of passing guilt
                    to others—the seemingly less remorseful and less caring West Germans. West
                    Germany's leaders, it was argued, had not been principled communists struggling
                    in Berlin during Hitler's rise to power. They formed the core of the Nazi
                    movement in places like Munich and remained fascistically inclined. These
                    propaganda themes were an underlying element in the GDR's disparagement of West
                    Germans, generally, as crassly materialistic and morally bereft.</p>
                <p>There were, of course, condemnations of Nazism in the West in many forms. Allied
                    victory brought freedom to West Germans, as it had not to the East. In West
                    Germany during the Cold War, celebrations of that victory were broadly based and
                    enthusiastic, nowhere more than in free Berlin. In facing the question of guilt,
                    younger generations in both Germanys held their parents and grandparents
                    accountable for the Nazi past, not themselves. They did not want German history
                    as a personal burden and this is understandable.</p>
                <p>What became of anti-Semitism in Germany during the Cold War years? This question
                    has little to do with the east-west divide. In latent form anti-Semitism
                    persisted, perhaps to a greater extent than one would like to think, as it did
                    in countries such as the Soviet Union and Poland. In West Berlin's atmosphere of
                    freedom of expression, one too often came across graffiti of swastikas, twin SS
                    lightning bolts and Jew-baiting slogans. What is particularly disturbing is that
                    these were the work of the youngest generation.</p>
                <p>13OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL: 1976-78</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>As my tour in East Germany was coming to an end, the Bureau of European Affairs
                    informed me I would probably be assigned to Athens as the deputy chief of
                    mission, although I did not speak Greek. I was then told the position had been
                    filled, and was asked whether I would like to be considered for the
                    ambassadorship to Malta. Despite my concerns about acceptable schools for our
                    children, I agreed. When that didn't work out either, I returned to Washington
                    without an assignment in the middle of summer, 1976 when positions on the summer
                    cycle had been filled. I went to see Bob Sayre, whom I knew from our Panama days
                    together when he was ambassador and I the country director. In 1976, he was
                    serving as Inspector General and had a Senior Inspector vacancy. I asked to join
                    his staff for a couple of years, and never regretted my request.</p>
                <p>There is widespread belief in the Foreign Service that assignments to the
                    Inspection Corps are not helpful to one's career, because management functions
                    are neither glamorous nor central to the diplomatic business of the Foreign
                    Service. In this view, they are not “substantive” or helpful to prospects for
                    promotion. I disagreed, and thought this would be a way to see places I would
                    not visit otherwise, and that I would learn a great deal more about how our
                    government works. For a year in 1962-63, I had been an assistant to William H.
                    Orrick, Jr., the State Department's top manager, and found management issues
                    intriguing, as I still do. I was happy to be based in Washington again for the
                    sake of our children, who would reenter the American school system. In any case,
                    my choices were limited at the time.</p>
                <p>I knew something about the inspection process, having recently been on the
                    receiving end in East Berlin of an inspection led by Sayre. Senior inspectors
                    were required to have been either ambassadors or DCMs at a Class I or II post.
                    In the mid-70s, the inspection process began to evolve from its traditional
                    forms toward today's practices. Mary and I moved into a house at 4938 Quebec
                    Street in Spring Valley, half way down a curved street on a hill lined with old
                    oaks that was ideal for winter sledding. Once the children were enrolled at
                    Annunciation School, I packed my bags in the fall for my first inspection
                    trip.</p>
                <p>A The Inspection Process: Eastern Europe</p>
                <p>For six weeks, my team inspected our missions and consulates in Romania,
                    Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. We inspected some of
                    State's regional operations in Vienna, partly to find answers to questions that
                    had been raised at our posts, but also to get dry cleaning done, something not
                    easily accomplished in Eastern Europe. I went to Moscow for a few days to
                    discuss the Soviet role in the region at our embassy; our itinerary reflected
                    the Cold War reality of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>It was a grueling experience: many posts, many problems, cold gray days and long
                    hours. I came away, once again, with a fresh understanding of how strikingly
                    different the countries of Eastern Europe were, one from another. Despite
                    pervasive Soviet influence, individual countries distinguished themselves in
                    terms of the character of their regimes, degrees of freedom, economic levels,
                    and especially cultures. There was nothing “monolithic” about them, a word often
                    used in the American political rhetoric of the time. Four years earlier, as a
                    member of the Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service Institute, I had made a
                    similar trip to write a paper on East Germany in Eastern Europe. I found little
                    change in the political and material well-being of these countries.</p>
                <p>What did it mean to “inspect” a Foreign Service post in the late 1970s? I like to
                    read novels, and find analogies between the concerns of novelists and Foreign
                    Service inspectors. Most writers place their characters in settings that provide
                    atmosphere and sense of place. Through such masters of interiors as Edith
                    Wharton and Henry James, for example, one sees the contours of New York and New
                    England's drawing rooms and feels the chill outside their windows. Gradually,
                    one understands the people who are introduced, their personalities and motives,
                    and the tensions and conflicts in their lives; the reader makes judgments about
                    them, cheers or boos them, and begins to care about their fates.</p>
                <p>An inspector, too, arrives at an embassy and finds the human predicament on stage
                    at this local theater, with actors still not known or understood who are caught
                    in roles depicting combinations of virtue, skullduggery, brilliance, altruism,
                    lust, hatred, theft, nobility, addiction, generosity, prejudice, ruthlessness,
                    egomania, stupidity, paranoia, graciousness, self-sacrifice—and, at an
                    exceedingly rare performance, even murder in cold blood. The inspector observes,
                    listens, analyzes, counsels, and writes his review. He does not linger to become
                    a captive enmeshed in outcomes, or to care too much. But the flavor of that
                    setting, the look of its people and light in their eyes, the street sounds, the
                    colors at sundown, remain with him and are later recalled like memories out of
                    an engrossing book.</p>
                <p>My team for Eastern Europe included an economic officer, an administrative
                    officer, and two trained auditors who devoted their time to reviewing compliance
                    with regulations and procedures, spot-checking accounts, and evaluating the
                    efficiency and quality of administrative services. An inspection report
                    contained a number of short evaluations of specific embassy functions. The
                    overall report summarized the main findings and recommendations of the team and
                    its judgments of an embassy or consulate's operations. Sayre's emphasis was on
                    leadership, implementation of policy goals, and management. We evaluated
                    economic and political reporting, consular operations, and resource use, but
                    Sayre's principal interest was in knowing how the post was being managed,
                    especially by the ambassador and his or her deputy, the DCM.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Our brief did not include a requirement to comment on current US policy, but
                    Sayre changed our approach to this as well. Inspectors first reviewed the
                    operation of country desks that were the home base in Washington for the posts
                    being inspected. Before a team went out, it spent time in the State Department's
                    bureaus getting briefed. Once finished overseas, it returned to the home bureau,
                    in this case European Affairs, and formally inspected country desk operations.
                    We were interested in evaluating how the State Department and our posts overseas
                    interacted. We could not ignore policy objectives in such a process, and were
                    invited to comment on the efficacy of policy when warranted. Some policy makers
                    in Washington felt that in doing so we were overstepping the boundaries of our
                    responsibilities. In fact, however, most embassies did not have written policy
                    statements, goals or objectives. We had to determine what these were through
                    interviews in Washington and at the embassies.</p>
                <p>We addressed policy head-on in my first report on Eastern Europe. At the time, it
                    was driven by Henry Kissinger's Cold War tactic of “linkages,” that is, the US
                    would do something for the Soviets or East Europeans only in return for
                    something specific they had done to accommodate our interests. At each embassy
                    we heard complaints about this constraint, although there was agreement that
                    benefits in the relationship should be kept in rough balance. What bothered our
                    diplomats abroad were problems of synchronization and a lack of flexibility in
                    this approach. The “linkage” theory was being applied too strictly, thereby
                    preventing progress on bilateral issues where progress could be made. We
                    endorsed this view in our report, which caused a minor stir in the Department's
                    senior ranks, but no change in policy.</p>
                <p>Inspections began with a notification to the post that a team would arrive on a
                    date several months ahead. Posts were required to prepare for the inspection, a
                    process which improved performance and compliance with regulations even before
                    the inspection began. Once a team arrived, it called on the principal officer
                    first, either an ambassador or consul general, and his or her deputy. Then it
                    met with the whole staff to familiarize it with inspection procedures and
                    proclaim that, “We are here to help you.” There was truth in that sentiment,
                    although it usually produced nervous laughter. The team was then walked through
                    the premises. If it was an embassy, the guide was usually the DCM. This
                    permitted the team to meet all of the staff; equally important, it provided an
                    opportunity to see how well the DCM knew the staff and what kind of rapport he
                    or she had with them. It was a measure of mood and morale, and a good way to
                    size up the physical plant, the work environment, and how embassy operations
                    were being conducted.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Then came discussions with individuals, using their private questionnaires. These
                    forms were completed by each American employee and delivered to the senior
                    inspector in sealed envelopes as the inspection began. They included frank
                    questions about the post's management and how an individual felt about his
                    assignment. The questionnaire was destroyed by inspectors before they left the
                    post. Since the information was protected, it was provided with candor in most
                    cases; sometimes, an inspection team discovered misfeasance or even malfeasance
                    through this procedure. The interview sessions were intended to elicit
                    information about work problems, morale of the staff, and their dealings with
                    Washington. Interviewers sought to determine whether the embassy's objectives
                    and priorities were known and understood—or had even been articulated.</p>
                <p>Interviews became the basis for efficiency reports inspectors were required, in
                    those days, to submit on each American employee at a post. This was an enormous
                    and unreasonable workload. Inspectors, arriving at the “theater” of their work,
                    were acquainted with most of the individuals for only a short time, although
                    they were privy to regular efficiency reports that had been submitted during
                    previous years, if they had been written at the post. An inspector's report not
                    only evaluated the employee, but commented on efficiency reports the post had
                    submitted previously. It gave the promotion boards another point of view, one
                    that was more distant and dispassionate. While I was in charge of the inspection
                    of our embassy in Manila, for example, I was able to correct a serious injustice
                    done to one of the administrative staff by a supervisor who was vindictive. My
                    own documented and unbiased evaluation negated the report he had received
                    earlier. Inspectors' personnel evaluations were a safety valve, a double check
                    to prevent miscarriages of justice, provide independent judgments, and recognize
                    failures and excellence.</p>
                <p>Each team member was assigned responsibility for a specific embassy
                    operation—political, economic, consular, or administrative, and then reviewed
                    these operations in detail. The senior inspector concentrated on the leadership
                    and management of the post, its front office profile. Each team leader was then
                    required to write a confidential letter to the Inspector General (and through
                    him to the Director General of the Foreign Service) concerning the performance
                    and management effectiveness of the ambassador. This remains true today, except
                    that reports on politically appointed ambassadors are now sent directly to the
                    White House staff. We also looked closely at relations between State Department
                    officers and representatives of other agencies, including the contribution
                    intelligence agencies were making to the post. The team's views on intelligence
                    oversight by the chief of mission were submitted by the senior inspector to the
                    Inspector General in a separate and secret report.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>This process made it necessary, in terms of credibility, that the team leader be
                    a former ambassador or DCM at a major post. Some ambassadors and DCMs being
                    inspected were people one knew, or with whom one might be working at a future
                    time, or who might serve on a board considering one's promotion. A few of my
                    colleagues were deferential when it came to making their evaluations. I tried to
                    be fair, and know I irritated at least one ambassador who later became Director
                    General of the Foreign Service and looked up my report in the files.</p>
                <p>Most senior inspectors were impartial, tough-minded and forthright, although
                    there were often problems with their drafting skills. In the 1970s the criteria
                    for inspections were not as sharply etched as they should have been, and later
                    became, through the Inspector General Act of 1978. The inspection process
                    depended too much on the human attributes and skills of the senior inspector:
                    the energy level, writing ability, perception skills, and even individual value
                    systems. Today, the standards are clearer and the inspections, I believe, are
                    more empirical even if they do not make very interesting reading. In my day, the
                    personal attributes and predilections of the senior inspectors were too central
                    to the process, resulting in an uneven product.</p>
                <p>I became interested in inspections as management tools. It is surprising to
                    discover what one can observe about an organization in just a few days. The
                    first post we inspected was Bucharest. I wondered whether I would be able to
                    understand how the embassy functioned in a mere eight days. By the fifth day, I
                    thought I understood quite well, at least to the extent needed to evaluate the
                    embassy's management and performance. One can observe a great deal in a short
                    time about professional and personal relationships among people. The training
                    inspectors received before their inspections was helpful in sharpening their
                    powers of observation and their listening as well as deductive skills. The
                    importance of observing body language was emphasized, a sophisticated notion for
                    the time. An outsider, in fact, may soon acquire a better feel for an operation
                    than someone deeply enmeshed day in and day out. The outsider is like a
                    physician who is disengaged personally and emotionally from his patient, and
                    whose judgments are clinically based.</p>
                <p>Earlier, I referred to a meeting with George Kennan at Oxford, as I prepared for
                    my visit to the Soviet Union in 1958, before joining the Foreign Service. He had
                    recommended I take the 1914 Baedeker on Russia with me as a travel guide. When I
                    returned to Moscow in 1974 at the end of my Eastern European inspection, Jack
                    and Rebecca Matlock, Jack then the deputy chief of mission, invited me to
                    dinner, which turned out to be in honor of George Kennan, who had returned to
                    Moscow for the first time since he was declared persona non grata by Stalin in
                    October, 1952. Kissinger's policy of detente had made his return possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>It was a fascinating evening. Kennan noted how little had changed outwardly in
                    Moscow since his service there. The city with its crumbling facades was still as
                    shabby, the theaters and ballet still as rich in their performances, as in his
                    days, their billboards unchanged in format. After dinner, I reminded him of his
                    advice to me many years earlier. I offered to lend him the Baedeker he had
                    commended to me. He was delighted, kept it during the rest of his stay in
                    Moscow, and took it with him to Leningrad. As he was leaving the Soviet Union,
                    he gave it to Jack Matlock to return to me. The Baedeker had served us both
                    well.</p>
                <p>There was one aspect of our Eastern European inspection about which my team felt
                    strongly. The State Department had recently assigned a regional psychiatrist to
                    Vienna. Service at Eastern European posts during the Cold War was highly
                    stressful, not only for employees but their families as well. We saw evidence of
                    alcohol abuse among men and women, problems with teenagers, and cases of
                    depression. Having just lived in East Berlin for two years, I was not surprised.
                    We thought the proximate psychiatric assistance the Department provided from
                    Vienna was both needed and of high quality, and recommended that regional
                    psychiatrists be assigned to each geographic area. In time this was done, and
                    has contributed to a more positive role by the State Department in supporting
                    families through programs of the Family Liaison Office, and Overseas Briefing
                    Center at the Foreign Service Institute. People-oriented government services are
                    vital in helping to cope with problems of living abroad, now intensified by
                    threats from terrorists and often easy access to drugs. Such assistance has
                    become increasingly important as family structures have changed in American
                    society (more divorces, single parents, older parents to support) and therefore
                    in the Foreign Service as well.</p>
                <p>The inspection corps had a number of outstandingly capable Foreign Service
                    officers. It always does. Among those with whom I worked closely were Albert N.
                    Williams, Richard Boehm, and Sheldon J. Krys. Inspection teams often become
                    closely knit units themselves, and lasting friendships are made. As in any
                    aspect of diplomatic work, a sense of humor helps. It creates perspective and
                    pricks pomposity. Inspections have their comic aspects, relished by
                    inspectors.</p>
                <p>This leads us to the ever satirical Sheldon J. Krys, and his Mythical Concept of
                    Personnel Evaluation and Simultaneous Reduction of Redundant Employees
                    (MCPESRRE). Living out this fantasy during inspection of an embassy would
                    require that at a time prior to the conclusion of the inspection, when
                    everything had been uncovered, all of its employees would line up outside the
                    chancery, rain or no, with the ambassador at the head, the DCM next, and so
                    forth. The omnipotent senior inspector then walks down this line, saying,
                    “Ambassador, please return to your desk inside.” After the ambassador, the
                    process would become more selective. Those not invited back to their desks, and
                    this might include the DCM, would no longer be working at the embassy. Much good
                    could be accomplished in this way.</p>
                <p>B The Bureau of Oceans, and International Environmental and Scientific
                    Affairs</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>I was next asked to lead an inspection of the State Department's relatively new
                    Bureau of Oceans, and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES)
                    then headed by former Representative Patsy Mink, a political appointee. Despite
                    her senior deputy Robert Brewster's best efforts, the bureau was in great
                    trouble. Staffed by people of uneven talent, some of whom were relegated to OES
                    because Personnel did not want to assign them to what it considered more
                    important work, OES was becoming one of the Siberias of the Department.</p>
                <p>I had watched OES try to bring its expertise to bear on the policy process,
                    starting with Herman Pollack, a pioneer in the Department's efforts to
                    incorporate foreign policy aspects of science and technology issues into policy
                    development. His office flourished because it had been assigned the lead role in
                    several international negotiations, as policy-makers such as Under Secretary U.
                    Alexis Johnson emphasized the importance of these issues, especially to US
                    trade. Strong impetus for the Department to become more seriously engaged in
                    these matters came from congress, where problems such as fishing rights, outer
                    space, and population growth had significant political constituencies.</p>
                <p>It was inevitable that this office, albeit at a snail's pace, would grow into a
                    bureau. In fact, some of the best jobs in the State Department for mid-level
                    officers, and obviously their seniors, could be found in OES. Such officers are
                    routinely involved in major international negotiations, with opportunities to
                    become acquainted with the policy aspects of the exploding worlds of science and
                    technology. OES was truly the bureau of the future.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, OES at the time did not receive much top level support, nor enough
                    help from the Department's resource managers. The concept of “one world” when it
                    came to issues of pollution, the oceans, and the biosphere had not yet captured
                    the attention of Seventh Floor principals. The Department still viewed such
                    problems essentially in a bilateral or regional framework, and in narrow
                    functional terms of economic, commercial, or political-military issues. There
                    was no sense yet of the global village. There seemed no inkling of the imminence
                    of an information revolution already well underway that would in a few more
                    years transform relationships between every individual and every organization on
                    the face of the earth.</p>
                <p>Inspecting this bureau was difficult. Our report was the hardest to write of any
                    I undertook. We worked on OES for five months. Management of the bureau was
                    weak, and we were obliged to reflect recently acquired knowledge in how we
                    defined its problems. We had to be precise as we made recommendations for
                    improvement, which are the bottom line of every inspection report. Each
                    recommendation requires corrective action on the part of the organization being
                    inspected. We knew we had to produce a report that would withstand the heat of
                    close scrutiny because our findings were laden with criticism.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I later learned that ours was one of the toughest inspection reports ever
                    written, and the only inspection report Secretary of State William Rogers
                    actually read. The report was instrumental in getting a civil service employee
                    fired. He had performed below the minimum requirements of his job for many
                    years, and we were able to document deficiencies leading to his dismissal. It
                    proved that people could be fired from the State Department, although this was a
                    painful process and required scrupulous attention to fairness. OES took many
                    years to improve, which it did under Thomas Pickering's leadership.</p>
                <p>C The US-Mexican International Boundaries and Water Commission</p>
                <p>I was asked to undertake my next inspection together with Ambassador Hewson Ryan,
                    who had been a deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Inter-American
                    Affairs. We were to inspect, for the first time, the US-Mexican International
                    Boundaries and Water Commission (IBWC), a remarkable organization until then
                    unknown to me. Ryan had recently left the bureau and joined the inspection corps
                    for this purpose. The two of us visited the 1800 mile border between the US and
                    Mexico. We had to familiarize ourselves with the highly technical duties and
                    responsibilities of the IBWC to which the Department made a large financial
                    contribution every year, although much of its substantive work concerned the
                    Department of the Interior. The American commissioner is appointed by the
                    president and has considerable independence, loosely reporting to the State
                    Department's Office of Mexican Affairs. The Mexicans handle their
                    responsibilities in a similar fashion. Our task was to find out how efficiently
                    the organization was managed, and how effectively its funding served US
                    interests.</p>
                <p>This led to one of the most absorbing journeys of my life. We traversed both
                    sides of that border by small and large planes, van and Jeep. As this was a
                    joint commission, we were interested in conditions on the Mexican border and the
                    interaction between US and Mexican authorities. We also wanted to observe the
                    twin border cities, of which there are quite a few, because these are critical
                    to US-Mexican relations. I found it fascinating to learn about various boundary
                    demarcations, the natural Thalwegs which run down the exact middle of waterways,
                    water rights, irrigation, and sewage disposal. Tricky problems arise when
                    communities belonging to different countries and cultures share a common
                    geographic region, resources, and environment. Illegal immigration was already a
                    serious problem in the 1970s and we addressed it in our report.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>We found in the IBWC a binational organization that functioned extremely well. We
                    were warmly received by the commissioner, Joseph Friedkin, and his staff because
                    they knew they were doing a good job, felt neglected, and wanted to tell us
                    about their work. Ryan retired before the end of our inspection, and I decided
                    to cast our final report as a success story, explaining the elements that
                    contributed to a highly efficient operation of great scope and size. I was
                    delighted when our report found wide readership, because we discussed basic
                    aspects of the management of a joint international endeavor which was tangible,
                    highly technical and complex, and which had its roots in a treaty relationship
                    between two governments. Both Americans and Mexicans were extraordinarily well
                    trained and competent. We were impressed by their skills and tactful treatment
                    of each other, especially at the operating and engineering levels, where they
                    regulated water flows and managed waste systems.</p>
                <p>Some words about that border. We began our trip in a raging flood in Brownsville,
                    Texas, and ended it in the dry heat and under blue skies of Tijuana, Mexico, at
                    an enormous sewage disposal plant. Before setting out, I read several books
                    written in the 19th century available in the State Department's library, travel
                    and exploration narratives full of local color, adventure and, in one journal, a
                    thinly veiled, poignant love affair involving an Army officer separated from his
                    family and a woman living along the Rio Grande. The region is still exciting.
                    The blurring of borders in twin cities such as El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, and
                    the degree to which such economies depend upon each other, as with our Canadian
                    boundary, was making the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993 inevitable.
                    No foreign travel has intrigued me more, and few experiences are more valuable
                    to a diplomat than to immerse himself in the collaborative work of his own
                    country with one of its great neighbors.</p>
                <p>D The Philippines and an Experiment</p>
                <p>I inspected the Philippines in the fall of 1977, leading the largest regularly
                    scheduled overseas inspection team until then. From a national security point of
                    view, the Philippines were important. The US had two large military bases in
                    that country vital to our strategic interests in the Pacific during the Cold
                    War. This inspection also gave us an opportunity to try a new approach.</p>
                <p>Inspector General Sayre was interested in assessing not only the operations of
                    the State Department's segment of our large embassy, but also those of all other
                    agencies represented at the post, each under the ambassador's authority. Sayre
                    wanted to determine, for the first time in an inspection, whether there was a
                    unifying connection between policy objectives and resource allocations across
                    the full spectrum of US government activities in the Philippines. It was a large
                    vision. Our inspection team was greatly expanded—it finally consisted of some 12
                    people—experts on security assistance, economic and investment programs, public
                    affairs, immigration, etc., but all from the State Department. We remained in
                    the Philippines for about six weeks.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>We were to assess the Country Team's performance in Manila. A Country Team is the
                    informal advisory body to an ambassador comprised of senior State Department
                    officers at the post and the heads of all other US government agencies
                    represented in the country. We notified other agencies in Washington of our
                    approach. Their responses, not surprisingly, were unenthusiastic, but they
                    nevertheless sent instructions to their representatives to cooperate. We were to
                    write the customary inspection report on State Department activities, but to
                    supplement it with separate memoranda on the performance of other agencies,
                    examining such matters as their coordination and relationships with other
                    segments of the embassy, and the relative values of the US government's overall
                    investments in our relationship with the Philippines. Might some resources, for
                    example, be more prudently devoted to other aspects of that relationship which
                    were underfunded?</p>
                <p>This question was loaded with bureaucratic dynamite. The inspection focused on
                    the substance of the bilateral relationship. It required unprecedented
                    assessments to be made of the value, efficiency, and relevance to US objectives
                    and priorities of the work of all agencies represented in the Philippines. At
                    the core of this process was the ambassador's effectiveness in directing the
                    full range of US activities and resource expenditures in the relationship. We
                    got into discussions of great depth with representatives of the other agencies,
                    and had no problems in obtaining necessary information, except for intelligence
                    functions. In effect, we were asking them to justify their presence.</p>
                <p>We returned from the Philippines with recommendations we could support. Ours was,
                    for the first time, a report covering the full sweep of US government activities
                    and resource allocations. The inspection drew so heavily on the State
                    Department's manpower and budget, and evoked such tentative responses from other
                    agencies to its recommendations, however, that a comprehensive inspection of
                    this kind was not undertaken again. The most important reason for giving up on
                    this effort to manage other agencies abroad, and stiffen an ambassador's
                    backbone in the process, was the Seventh Floor leadership's lack of serious
                    interest in doing so.</p>
                <p>The concept was valid. The Philippine inspection was a meaningful assessment
                    which gave in a single document a broader and deeper understanding of the aims
                    of US programs. It assessed how agencies supported each other, where they
                    overlapped, how some were over-funded and over-staffed, and others starved. It
                    put our ambassador at the helm in its concept. If the State Department, as it
                    should be, were given jurisdiction over the Function 150 Account, the budgetary
                    designation for international affairs activities, an inspection such as the
                    Philippines would not only be useful and acceptable, it would become
                    mandatory.</p>
                <p>E The Iberian Peninsula</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>My last overseas inspection turned out to be a treat: Spain and Portugal in 1978,
                    with Madeira added (by me) because of interest in the consular agent function.
                    The embassies in Madrid, under Wells Stabler, and in Lisbon, under Charg� Edward
                    Rowell—Ambassador Frank Carlucci had recently departed—were functioning as they
                    should. This left time for the Prado Museum and the pleasures of Barcelona and
                    Seville, where we had consulates. We visited the Azores and our military base
                    there, and I spent two days in Bilbao, where Basque separatist tensions were
                    palpable.</p>
                <p>A weekend in Madeira took me to an island whose shores and mountainous beauty I
                    could not have imagined. The wines were as advertised. We produced a report that
                    eventually led to an expanded use of consular agents, particularly in port
                    areas, an arrangement that provided needed services at low cost. Consular agents
                    are local citizens empowered by the State Department to perform certain consular
                    and protocol functions in places where we do not have consulates. They are
                    provided an office and moderate stipend for their part-time work.</p>
                <p>F Value of Inspections</p>
                <p>There are inescapably logical links between policy planning, resource allocation,
                    and the inspection process. These functions should become sequential by first
                    establishing objectives and priorities through planning, then supporting these
                    with resources (people, money, funded programs), and finally evaluating and
                    fine-tuning the implementation of policies and procedures designed to meet the
                    purposes of our foreign activities.</p>
                <p>In the State Department, these three elements of management take place
                    independently of each other. The planning function is more removed from the
                    other two. One can only imagine the progress that could be made toward coherence
                    in foreign policies, were a secretary of state to create theposition of
                    Permanent Under Secretary and then charge the incumbent with responsibility for
                    keeping these functions in harmony through time.</p>
                <p>14DAS, BUREAU OF INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS: 1978-80</p>
                <p>Near the end of my service in the office of the Inspector General, Viron “Pete”
                    Vaky was appointed assistant secretary for Inter-American Affairs (ARA). Bob
                    Sayre recommended me to Pete as one of his deputies. I had worked with Vaky in
                    my days as director for Panamanian Affairs during 1969-71, when he was the Latin
                    American specialist on the National Security Council staff. He asked me to join
                    him, succeeding Sally A. Shelton, a petite, hard-working and highly competent
                    political appointee from Texas, who subsequently served as ambassador to
                    Barbados and a string of other islands in the Caribbean.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>I became the deputy assistant secretary in charge of Mexico, the Caribbean,
                    Central America, and Panama. My brief did not include Cuba, which Vaky handled
                    himself because there were expectations that under Carter we might be able to
                    make progress in relations with Castro. The other deputies were John A. Bushnell
                    for economic affairs, and Ralph Guzman, a political appointee who covered the
                    rest of the region.</p>
                <p>A Grenada and Haiti</p>
                <p>In the Caribbean, major changes were taking place. New countries such as Antigua,
                    St. Lucia and Grenada were emerging. Grenada was of particular concern to us
                    because Maurice Bishop, its prime minister, was a prot�g� of Fidel Castro. He
                    led what was called “The New Jewel” movement. Bishop's rhetoric was troubling to
                    other Caribbean countries as well. Hardly in the same league with Berlin as a
                    Cold War flash point, Grenada nevertheless was a near neighbor and therefore of
                    some concern. I found Bishop's “Marxism” intriguing for its lack of orthodoxy or
                    serious connection to political philosophy. It was, for its proponents, a road
                    to political power through support from Cuba and the Soviet Union, which had its
                    own ambitions in the Caribbean. It was also a way to stick pins into Uncle
                    Sam.</p>
                <p>Haiti smouldered under its brutal regime, extreme poverty, and economic
                    hopelessness. I found Haiti vibrant and colorful, its oppressed people in a
                    daily struggle for the essentials of life but incongruously cheerful
                    nonetheless. Tontons Macoutes militias terrorized the villagers, yet there was
                    also music, dancing, and a great deal of painting. Haiti shows its African
                    heritage as no other Caribbean island. Its drum beats are different from those
                    of other places, and its blend of Voodoo practices and the Creole language are
                    distinctive. From my two years in West Africa, I recognized Dahomian (now Benin)
                    influences in its culture, particularly in the rhythms and sounds of music. Like
                    those of many African countries, Haiti's problems of economic deprivation and
                    social injustice did not lend themselves to miraculous cures, then or today.</p>
                <p>B Panama Canal Treaty Implementation</p>
                <p>We were deeply engaged in obtaining Panama Canal Treaty implementation
                    legislation in the House of Representatives. The treaty had been ratified by the
                    Senate in April of 1978, and was therefore the law of the land. The canal would
                    be owned by Panama at the turn of the century. Congress now needed to implement
                    and fund the treaty's provisions. This required us to meet often with members
                    and staffs of the engaged committees, and testify before them. There remained
                    strong resistance to the treaty itself in the House, led by Congressman John
                    Murphy, a Democrat from Staten Island, NY.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>The Department's efforts to obtain this necessary legislation were headed by
                    Ambassador David H. Popper, whose small staff was entirely devoted to treaty
                    implementation. David was a solid professional. We got along well in areas where
                    our responsibilities overlapped. Congressional relations were in the deft hands
                    of Elizabeth Frawley in the Office of Legislative Affairs (H), who had worked on
                    the Hill, and spent nearly all of her time there promoting implementation
                    legislation. Too few in H were willing to walk the corridors day in and day out,
                    as she did. Politics seemed in her blood. Our views not only gained support, but
                    we were well informed about what the members were thinking.</p>
                <p>This was my first opportunity to testify before a congressional committee. It is
                    an intimidating experience at best. To prepare, I learned everything I could
                    about treaty implementation requirements. Most of the hearings were held by the
                    House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee because they concerned the Panama
                    Canal itself. Since treaty implementation legislation was a politically charged
                    issue, these hearings were well attended by the media. One could expect a crowd
                    and klieg lights.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, the committee stayed in session for nearly a whole day. The
                    witnesses were General McAuliffe, of the Southern Command, and myself. We did
                    not have lunch and were not offered water. Committee members strolled in and out
                    of the hearings as the spirit moved them. We sweated under hot lights, listening
                    to members on the high dais make long statements, pro and con, and parried
                    hostile questions. I was physically drained but believed, as did McAuliffe, that
                    we had held our ground. He was a forceful and impressive witness. His military
                    record, four stars and bearing gave his words special weight with the
                    committee.</p>
                <p>In addition to understanding the subject matter and policy objectives of his
                    testimony, a government witness before a congressional committee needs to be
                    aware of the makeup of the audiences. These are, first, the committee members
                    themselves and the domestic and foreign media. An interested country will have
                    its embassy's officials at the hearing. Reporting by the media can be
                    instantaneous for a wide audience. An offhand comment that seems of little
                    consequence in Washington can assume major proportions in another capital and
                    provoke strong reactions, particularly if national pride is offended. This
                    becomes a damage control headache for the local American ambassador.</p>
                <p>Transcripts of hearings are printed several weeks after they occur. An opening
                    statement by the witness provides an important opportunity to shape the record.
                    Texts of opening statements are usually sent to committees, at the insistence of
                    their staffs, 48 hours before hearings are scheduled to provide staffers time to
                    develop committee strategy. Skilled witnesses know how to make their main points
                    at any opportunity, offering only a perfunctory reply to the question put to
                    them and continuing with their own agenda.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>The public impact of hearings dissipates. It is gone after the chairman closes
                    the session, the scruffily dressed camera crews pack up, television reporters
                    expound on the evening news, and the print press files its stories. If media
                    coverage has been heavy, a vague impression of the hearing may be left with the
                    public. What remains for those seriously concerned with legislative history is
                    the enduring record itself.</p>
                <p>In the end, adequate implementation legislation for the Panama Canal Treaties of
                    1978 was passed by the congress, for which much credit goes to David Popper.</p>
                <p>C Central America: Somoza</p>
                <p>The situation in Nicaragua in 1978 was a god-awful mess. President Anastasio
                    Somoza, a wily and unprincipled man, usually understood the US government and
                    American mood uncannily well, particularly in terms of our likely reactions to
                    whatever he might decide to do. He graduated from West Point. His friends in
                    congress were powerful; the ties in some cases were extremely close, based on
                    shared business interests. By the late 1970s, however, Somoza was barely hanging
                    on as president. We were getting reports of heavy drinking starting in the
                    morning, and bouts of depression. Somoza cornered American journalists and
                    ranted at length about his “enemies” in the Carter administration who, he
                    claimed, were soft on communism and the pro-Castro Sandinistas. His mantra was
                    the Cold War. The Sandinistas' leaders were indeed Marxists, and they were
                    deadly serious. Their forces were winning village after village from Somoza's
                    National Guard, who were losing their zest for fighting. There was no doubt the
                    Sandinistas were the popular favorites, however.</p>
                <p>Two or three times a week, I attended intelligence briefings in Pete Vaky's
                    office during which the Sandinistas' progress toward Managua was starkly
                    displayed on maps with plastic overlays. It was inexorable, leading like Greek
                    drama to a fate we could foresee. We recognized our options to influence this
                    situation were limited and Somoza was unwilling to discuss his departure. He
                    thought, somehow, his friends in congress would find a way to save him.</p>
                <p>Nicaragua was widely viewed in the US as another Cold War issue, a thinly
                    disguised Soviet attempt, along with Bishop's accession to power in Granada, to
                    infiltrate the Caribbean and provide Castro a wider network for destabilizing
                    the region. In ARA, events in and around Nicaragua were seen as more complex and
                    regional in nature by most of us working on these problems. We were concerned
                    about the Soviet role, but did not view Nicaragua's troubles primarily in that
                    light. No consideration was given to sending American forces to support Somoza;
                    he was discredited in the hemisphere, and losing the fight on the ground. The
                    remaining option for us was a diplomatic one, and the administration decided to
                    try it out.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>Mediation was the approach. William G. Bowdler, who then headed the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research, had previously been ambassador to El Salvador and
                    Guatemala, as well as South Africa, and was following the Nicaraguan situation
                    closely. He was picked by Carter to try to bridge the gap between Somoza and the
                    Sandinistas and, eventually, provide for national elections. He was an inspired
                    choice. With his foreign service aides James Cheek and Malcolm Barnebey, Bowdler
                    set up shop in Managua and began to look for middle ground in the political
                    equation.</p>
                <p>Bowdler put together a “Group of Twelve” upper middle class Nicaraguan moderates
                    prominent in the private sector, the church, and free press. With great skill,
                    he tried to steer them toward a united leadership role that would constitute an
                    alternative to Somoza. The “Group of Twelve” bickered among themselves, jockeyed
                    for power in their own ranks and, in the end, couldn't get their act together.
                    Somoza and his few adherents imploded. The Sandinistas filled the vacuum.</p>
                <p>When the voluminous cable traffic Bowdler sent back from his negotiations in
                    Managua becomes declassified, it will reveal an effort of exceptional
                    imagination, creativity, and skill on the part of Bowdler and his team. It will
                    also stand as an example of the best in diplomatic analysis and initiative,
                    produced under great pressures of time and events. Bowdler never seemed to run
                    out of new approaches. His assessments proved accurate throughout.Bowdler,
                    however, was dealing with a situation in Managua which quickly lost any prospect
                    of flexibility or peaceful resolution. In Washington, on the other hand, there
                    was uncertainty at the highest levels about whether to push Somoza toward
                    departure, and if so how hard. This uncertainty was rooted primarily in US
                    domestic and congressional politics at a time when the Carter administration was
                    looking vulnerable on other fronts.</p>
                <p>Our ambassador to Nicaragua was Mauricio Solaun, a mild-mannered political
                    appointee who was ineffectual. His embassy's political reporting was weak, and
                    at times unreliable and biased toward Somoza. The embassy seemed to duck the
                    need to report “bad” news. Understandably, it was not an easy task to tell
                    Washington that the Nicaraguan situation was unraveling, and that the
                    Sandinistas were making daily gains in the countryside, but what are embassies
                    for if not to convey such analysis?</p>
                <p>Warren Christopher, the deputy secretary, took charge of our Nicaraguan policy.
                    Christopher was a formal and rather distant person who had no interest in small
                    talk or banter. He had placed a T-shaped table arrangement in the small
                    conference room behind his formal outer office, and seated himself at the top of
                    the T, leaving the rest of us to find places around the longer bar. It made for
                    a school-masterish atmosphere. We would lean forward in our chairs to present
                    problems which did not lead to the disciplined, clean analysis he, as a lawyer,
                    favored. We had to check with Christopher on virtually everything having to do
                    with Nicaragua, and clear with him or his staff matters that in my view should
                    have been left to an assistant secretary. Nicaraguan policy was micromanaged to
                    a disconcerting extent.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>The administration could not decide what to do about Somoza himself. If we wanted
                    him to leave Nicaragua, whom would we support as his successor? We did not want
                    a Sandinista take-over, but were unable to find an alternative. Our “Group of
                    Twelve” remained hopelessly divided among themselves; the moderates had failed
                    to seize the opportunity to govern. The same questions were asked over and over
                    again in Christopher's office, the same discussions took place time after time
                    with few conclusions. It was a case of policy drift on one of the major foreign
                    policy issues of Carter's presidency.</p>
                <p>Yet, it was clear that the Sandinistas enjoyed wide public support and would
                    prevail over the National Guard, and that Somoza would have to leave one way or
                    another. He finally did so at the behest of Ambassador Lawrence Pezzulo,
                    Carter's special envoy, on July 20, 1979. When Pezzulo arrived in Managua, after
                    the failure of Bowdler's mediation efforts, to tell Somoza the US wanted him to
                    leave, he was amazed to see, seated with Somoza in the president's office,
                    Congressman John Murphy who was attending the meeting at Somoza's invitation.
                    Larry told me later it was the biggest shock of his professional life.</p>
                <p>Another example of the oddity of the Nicaraguan policy environment is the
                    following insight into President Carter's interest in the subject. Bill Bowdler
                    returned to Washington frequently during his mediation efforts in Managua to
                    report back and get his next steps approved. On one such occasion, he was
                    unexpectedly summoned to the White House, where he met alone with the president
                    in the oval office. Carter asked him at the outset, “Ambassador Bowdler, do you
                    believe Somoza is an evil man?” Bill told me later he was so astonished by the
                    question he hardly knew what to answer, beyond expressing his judgment that,
                    yes, Somoza was an evil man. This seemed to be the point of his summons, and
                    Bill returned to the Department where I ran into him in the hall, still a bit
                    dazed.</p>
                <p>After Somoza's fall, I went to Managua with Senator Edward Zorinsky, a
                    conservative Republican from Nebraska. Uncharacteristically for a conservative,
                    he strongly supported the administration's efforts in Nicaragua. The first time
                    I briefed him, the senator asked why the State Department did not recognize that
                    the Sandinistas were winning and, therefore, why were we not doing more to
                    remove Somoza? After I explained the difficulties, including the ones in
                    congress, he became helpful to us on the Hill. When the senator planned a trip
                    to Managua in the summer of 1979, after Somoza's ouster, he asked me to join him
                    and a member of his staff. Larry Pezzulo had just begun his tour as ambassador,
                    despite the absence of a government to receive his credentials. Zorinsky wanted
                    to see the situation on the ground, and Secretary Vance approved my going.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>It was a memorable few days. We stayed at the ambassador's residence, which still
                    looked more like a military command post than ambassadorial living quarters. At
                    night, we could hear the sounds of gunfire as the Sandinistas were mopping up or
                    shooting off their weapons in celebration. Our official escort was “Commandante
                    Zero,” Eden Pastora, who in August of 1978 had occupied Somoza's chamber of
                    deputies in an act publicized around the world. Despite my meager Spanish, I was
                    able to communicate with Pastora and got along rather well with him. He seemed
                    to feel no animosity toward the US. He was politically naive and simplistic, but
                    charismatic. At one point I had my picture taken with him, wondering whether
                    this would end my career.</p>
                <p>Our small delegation called on Tomas Borge, the Minister of the Interior who held
                    the real power in Nicaragua during the early days following the Sandinista's
                    take-over. Borge was a grim man of few words, a Marxist ideologue with no charm
                    and a frightening certainty of the correctness of his harsh views. He was known
                    to have the blood of many Nicaraguans on his hands. There was nothing to like
                    about Borge.</p>
                <p>At lunch, I sat with Daniel Ortega, who was to become president later. His
                    English was very good and he was proud of an American education. He described
                    himself to me as a Marxist, but not a communist. He emphasized this distinction
                    to underscore his statement that Nicaragua did not intend to align itself with
                    Castro. He pushed hard for US support. I was impressed by Ortega's intelligence
                    and toughness; he obviously was a leader.</p>
                <p>I came away from that lunch and subsequent discussions in Managua believing the
                    US could have a workable relationship with the Sandinistas if we knew what we
                    wanted to achieve, and then pushed hard. I believed Larry Pezzulo, with his
                    energy and creative thinking, could succeed; he was the right man in the right
                    spot. But this was not to be for many years, because our own government
                    continued its policy of drift.</p>
                <p>D Guyana: The Jonestown Suicides</p>
                <p>Early on the evening of September 18, 1978 I was working in my office at the
                    State Department when our ambassador in Georgetown, Guyana, John Burke, called.
                    He told me that shots had been fired at a landing strip in the Jonestown
                    religious community deep in the mountainous jungles. The preliminary report was
                    that Congressman Leo Ryan, a California Democrat, had been killed. Our desk
                    officer knew Ryan was there, because he had tried to discourage the congressman
                    from going to Guyana. Within minutes, the report was confirmed. As it turned
                    out, others at the airstrip were killed and several were wounded. I called
                    Ashley Hewitt, director of Caribbean affairs, and the two of us met to launch
                    what was to become the largest task force operation in the State Department in
                    peacetime. Jonestown would also become the biggest world-wide media story since
                    the end of World War II.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>In crisis situations, information becomes available piece by piece, and often
                    confusingly. The fact that a congressman had been killed required us to
                    establish a channel to the Hill immediately. The first bits of information
                    beyond the assassination which reached us that evening were extremely disturbing
                    and made us even more uneasy. The current desk officer had served in Guyana, and
                    had been to Jonestown to perform consular functions. I learned that Jonestown
                    was an isolated community of approximately 1,000 religious cultists presided
                    over by the Rev. James Jones, who had brought his followers from California to
                    this remote place in Guyana. Jones was American, as were his followers. The
                    tragedy was to become an American tragedy.</p>
                <p>Early in the unfolding of this episode, we learned there had been talk in
                    Jonestown of rehearsals for mass suicides. Jones had predicted a great crisis
                    would one day threaten the community and its survival. When that happened, he
                    told his followers, it would be necessary for everyone to seek salvation through
                    suicide. We eventually came to believe that Ryan's visit, during which he
                    intended to ask Jones probing questions about the freedom of his followers to
                    leave the community, became the crisis that triggered Jones to stage his final
                    act. He apparently believed the community's isolation had been shattered and it
                    could no longer survive. Our focus was on Ryan and events at the airstrip. It
                    did not occur to us, at first, that a mass suicide might have taken place,
                    something so irrational and unimaginable. Not too many hours later, however,
                    Guyanese troops reached the Jonestown settlement, and alarming reports began
                    filtering back.</p>
                <p>As soon as I heard that a congressman had been killed, I alerted Warren
                    Christopher. He instructed me to call our embassy, and keep the phone line open
                    so it would become permanently available to us, an excellent procedure in crisis
                    management. The media rushed to Guyana with an overwhelming need for telephones,
                    but we were never without direct and continuous contact with our embassy.</p>
                <p>Hewitt established a task force in the State Department's Operations Center,
                    which became the crisis center for our work. As Guyanese troops made their way
                    to Jonestown, they reported back what they were finding to their military
                    headquarters in Georgetown, which relayed information to us in Washington
                    through our embassy. While flying over the site, the Guyanese observed what
                    appeared to be clothing on the ground drying in the sun in an enormous, colorful
                    patchwork of different patterns. These were, in fact, clothes on the bodies of
                    people who had died after drinking a brew of Kool-Aid mixed with poison prepared
                    by Jones and his lieutenants.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>Guyanese soldiers were reporting many dead, at least 300 or 400. It appeared all
                    had committed suicide. This was hard to imagine or believe, at first: hundreds
                    of Americans in a mass suicide! I passed this report to Christopher at about
                    2:00 a.m. the second day, and recommended it be released to the press. He
                    agreed. Included in our task force was a woman from the Bureau of Public
                    Affairs, who was our liaison to the press. I picked up a yellow pad and wrote
                    that our ambassador in Georgetown had informed the State Department he had been
                    told by the Government of Guyana there had been a mass suicide on the part of
                    many Americans in Jonestown. I will never forget my sinking feelings as I tore
                    off the yellow page with that statement, and authorized its release to the wire
                    services. After I had done this, I wondered for a moment whether I had lost my
                    mind, or was dreaming. Within a matter of minutes this statement would become
                    public knowledge all over the world and trigger one of the greatest media
                    frenzies ever. There was a frightening irrevocability to the step I had
                    taken.</p>
                <p>The next morning, we began to have a better understanding of what had happened.
                    The deaths were confirmed. An embassy officer managed to reach the scene. There
                    was a meeting in my office at which Hewitt reported US military planes were
                    getting ready to take off for Jonestown to bring back the dead. He had asked the
                    military to load 500 body bags. I told him to make that 900. As it turned out,
                    more than 900 Americans had committed suicide, at the insistence of James Jones,
                    who also killed himself.</p>
                <p>The Jonestown calamity gripped people everywhere for its morbid fascination,
                    revulsion, and defiance of rationality. Dealing with the media was an
                    overwhelming task. One could feel people's minds straining to absorb what had
                    happened and understand its meaning. There was no logical explanation, no
                    context within which to make these events intelligible. All of us who dealt with
                    Jonestown were emotionally wrenched. The incident had no consequences for our
                    foreign policy. There was no Cold War dimension. It became an American tragedy
                    played out in the jungles of Guyana.</p>
                <p>In the aftermath of Jonestown, I learned that the FBI had obtained a tape
                    recording, apparently left by Jones, of the mass suicide. The tape was filled
                    with the shouts and screams of women and children witnessing the deaths of their
                    families and friends while drinking their own potions in the belief that they
                    were all heaven-bound. The Rev. Jones was urging them on in what could only have
                    been a scene from hell. I was asked whether I wanted to hear the tape, which was
                    being tightly held for its evidentiary value and sensationalism. Should I
                    listen, or not? There was no need for me to do so in connection with my
                    responsibilities, yet here was an intriguing opportunity. After all, this really
                    happened. I declined. I did not want to have etched in my memory, in a way that
                    could never be expunged, the record of such madness.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>Our task force worked on Jonestown for at least a month. For me, the Jonestown
                    tragedy lasted several months longer, because the State Department received a
                    congressional request for all documents pertaining to the event. There was talk
                    of holding hearings. Two of State's lawyers, Ashley Hewitt, and I assembled
                    every document, including our own notes. We catalogued nearly 1,000, boxed them,
                    and gave them to the congressional staff with whom we had been working closely.
                    The House Foreign Affairs Committee was interested in exploring whether there
                    had been negligence on the part of the Department or our embassy in Georgetown
                    that might have contributed to Congressman Ryan's death. We were completely open
                    with the committee staff, which eventually was satisfied there had been no
                    irregularities, and decided that hearings were not warranted. One could hear the
                    sigh of relief on the Hill, where no one wanted to open this can of worms.</p>
                <p>E Assessment of the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs</p>
                <p>I have often reflected on ARA as it was at this time. At the level of deputy
                    assistant secretary I would normally have enjoyed a modest role in shaping our
                    relations with countries for which I was nominally responsible. The implosion of
                    Somoza's regime in Nicaragua, however, which was well underway when I arrived in
                    1978, so overwhelmed our concerns in the rest of Central America and the
                    Caribbean that our policies elsewhere in the region became hostage to this
                    continuing crisis.</p>
                <p>Somoza, of course, was not the only focus of the Carter administration's foreign
                    policy. In the Cold War, detente was over and relations with the Soviet Union
                    had returned to previous levels of stress. The trial for treason in Moscow of
                    dissident Anatoly Sharansky, SALT II negotiations, the American embassy's
                    hostage crisis in Iran, negotiation of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and
                    Israel, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were some of the other foreign
                    policy headaches at the time.</p>
                <p>And yet, in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, authority that would normally
                    have been exercised by Assistant Secretary Vaky was withheld by Warren
                    Christopher, then deputy secretary, with the debilitating effects of his
                    intermittent attention and micro-management. Nicaragua was perceived by the
                    Carter administration as in large part a domestic problem with major
                    congressional components. With its Sandinista ties to Cuba, Nicaragua, too,
                    assumed Cold War proportions. Christopher would not let go, and the ARA Bureau,
                    never receptive to tight management, was left to flounder. Morale was terrible,
                    and sapped further by double digit inflation. Government salaries were frozen,
                    which meant that a pay check was worth less and less on each successive
                    payday.</p>
                <p>This was to become the only assignment I found neither professionally nor
                    personally rewarding. Every career has at least one such episode and I did not
                    know that Jerusalem lay ahead.15CONSUL GENERAL, JERUSALEM: 1980-83</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>A O Jerusalem</p>
                <p>The first memories that come to me about Jerusalem are its sunsets and sunrises.
                    I have never seen light of such soft and rosy hue as it reflects off the
                    Jerusalem stone of buildings in the old part of the city. It has a golden glow
                    at times, in Jerusalem's uncontaminated air three thousand feet above the sea.
                    Yet the city has a feeling of solemnity. Christ, as he reached the summit of the
                    Mount of Olives, is said to have gazed on Jerusalem and wept. Today, he would
                    surely do the same.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem is the home of friends to me and my family. Father Godfrey, a
                    Franciscan friar, was such a person. He was best known for his knowledge as an
                    archeologist and tour guide in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and for his sense of
                    humor. In his brown frock, he reminded us of Friar Tuck—round, warm, jovial, and
                    quite a gourmet. He was a native of Washington, DC although he lived for many
                    years in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Freddy Weisgal was an American Jew living in Jerusalem. He and his wife Jean
                    opened their home to other Americans. Freddy was a fine jazz pianist and a
                    raucously funny man, a great friend of American journalists, well known for his
                    parties. He invited us to Yom Kippur and other Jewish holidays, a wonderful
                    entry, through American eyes, into Jewish life in Jerusalem. On my last night in
                    Jerusalem, Freddy gave a party at the old American Colony Hotel. As we gathered
                    around the piano in the bar after dinner, Freddy played his incomparable
                    rendition of Ellington's “Black and Blue,” my favorite, and an apt description
                    of how I felt after three years among Palestinians and Likudniks.</p>
                <p>And then there were the Harman and Eitan families, scholars and diplomats, the
                    most delightful and generous of friends. Amos and Beth Elon, perceptive and
                    sensitive people, were so painfully troubled by the actions of their government
                    in Lebanon and on the West Bank that it was sometimes hard to be in their
                    company.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem is a city of hats: Armenian priests with triangular hats, Greek
                    Orthodox with cylindrical hats, skull caps—kipahs—Israeli men wear, Palestinians
                    with their scarves and headbands, and Russian Orthodox priests whose hats
                    resemble flower pots more than anything else. Never have I been in a place where
                    head dress plays such a defining role. Jerusalem is also a city of distinct
                    neighborhoods, with its heart inside the old walls. Mea Shearim is home to
                    ultra-orthodox Jews, where men wear Polish medieval clothes, and women are
                    covered from head to foot. A Jewish friend wearing a light Parisian summer dress
                    told me she had been spat upon in Mea Shearim.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>The century old American Colony Hotel, with its beautiful inner court and a
                    muezzin in a mosque nearby who wakes people early each morning with his call to
                    prayers, is situated in the Arab quarter of East Jerusalem. Founded by the
                    Spafford and Vester families generations earlier, it was a refuge in an Ottoman
                    style for journalists and others who chose not to stay at the King David Hotel
                    in West Jerusalem, despite its spectacular views. The esteemed Philadelphia
                    Restaurant where its owner Walid so generously presided, was nearby.</p>
                <p>Easter brings vivid memories. My sons, some friends, and I would rise in chilly
                    darkness, and go to one of the hilltops around Jerusalem from which we could
                    look toward Jericho. As the sun appeared, we heard donkeys bray and roosters
                    crow. Groups of Christians sang hymns and assured each other that Christ had
                    risen. Then we had an Easter champagne breakfast spread upon the ground.
                    Ramadan, a Muslim holiday of fasting to celebrate the poor, touched us in its
                    self-denial.</p>
                <p>Jews say that if you leave Jerusalem on a journey, you have not returned until
                    you revisit the Wall. I came to understand, and felt this way myself. During my
                    assignment I left Israel often, and never believed I had truly returned until I
                    touched the Wall again. I fondly recall the run-down Anglican School in the
                    former Hadassah Hospital, which two of my children attended. Paul graduated from
                    there, and my youngest son, Mark, was heartbroken and cried when we had to
                    leave.</p>
                <p>My favorite place was half-way down into the old city where the Jewish Quarter
                    abuts the Arab. There, at a certain high point, you find yourself in a small and
                    empty square, one side of which is open to an astonishing view beyond the
                    cramped Arab homes with their red-tiled roofs and cats below. Straight ahead and
                    also below, is the Western Wall with the Dome of the Rock above it, sacred to
                    Jews and Muslims. Beyond the old city a Christian church spire rises on the
                    Mount of Olives. All of this in one frame. I came here often, because this sight
                    was such an extraordinary physical representation of the confluence of three
                    great faiths in Jerusalem. One could stand in that quiet and empty square, and
                    see evidence in stone of the great cross-currents that shaped, with so much
                    bloodshed, the city's course through history.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem is a place of religious observances, none more solemn than Yom Kippur.
                    During this time of soul-searching, the city comes to a silent standstill,
                    except for emergency services. I recall walking down King George Street, a major
                    thoroughfare, with my son Mark. It was deserted. Mark stretched out in the
                    middle of the street, celebrating the absence of people and traffic. During Yom
                    Kippur, Jerusalem is miraculously filled with the sounds of its birds. Jerusalem
                    has no international airport. This city on hilltops is approached from the
                    ground, either from the sea or desert. One climbs up to reach Jerusalem. In the
                    early 1980s, there was still a feeling of having arrived at a small and quiet
                    place, a rather sparse and somber enclave where the mood was set by scholarship
                    and gods.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>In jarring contrast are the Jewish settlements that now ring the city like the
                    wall against Arabs they are partly intended to be. Politically motivated,
                    hastily built and often unneeded apartment complexes, the settlements are
                    strategically placed to defend the city from its hilltops and expand Jerusalem's
                    perimeters. In nearly every case, they are built on expropriated land
                    Palestinians believe to be their own. The settlements bring more cars,
                    pollution, population and ugliness to the environs of Jerusalem. They form a
                    harsh skyline. Settlements crowd this former city of open places and small stone
                    houses and squeeze it toward its ancient core. The old city becomes increasingly
                    quaint, an attraction to tourists, archeologists and pilgrims. It no longer
                    seems the heart and raison d'etre of Jerusalem, around which the rest of the
                    city emerged over centuries to provide support.</p>
                <p>People in the Foreign Service are asked what their favorite post was. It is a
                    difficult question to answer, because all assignments have their good and bad
                    aspects for professional and personal reasons. When you are young and at the
                    bottom of the ladder there is the challenge of getting it right and the
                    satisfaction of being promoted. Parents and children are young too, and that is
                    a special pleasure as well as responsibility. Years later, with hard work and
                    luck, you may be near the top of your profession and enjoying the
                    responsibilities and perquisites of its senior members, as in being an
                    ambassador. But the children have grown and are gone and family life has
                    changed. These two lines can intersect, like the curves of supply and demand. In
                    my case, and I believe for my children also, this occurred in Jerusalem, where
                    the struggles of Arabs and Jews were our daily life, and the city, when you know
                    its neighborhoods and Anglican School, and become close to people living there,
                    takes you over. I answer this question by saying Jerusalem, because of its
                    intrusive mood and beauty when we were there, and its capacity to humble.</p>
                <p>B Jerusalem and its Consulates</p>
                <p>My assignment to Jerusalem took me by surprise. As I finished my work in the
                    Bureau of Inter-American Affairs in the winter of 1979, I expected to become
                    ambassador to Haiti, and started preparing for that appointment when I received
                    a call from Personnel. Secretary of State Vance, who normally took no interest
                    in assignments below the ambassadorial level, had decided to select the new
                    consul general to Jerusalem himself, because of the importance of implementing
                    the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel concluded on September 17, 1978.
                    Would I be interested in going? Jerusalem of course was not an embassy, while
                    Haiti was, but it had many of the attributes of a chief of mission posting and
                    would be engrossing work.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem was the farthest place from my mind. When I asked Personnel why they
                    had thought of me, their answer was that I had the right credentials: no
                    association with Jerusalem, and neither the Israelis nor Palestinians knew of
                    me. Initially, at least, I would not be a problem for either side.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>I went to Philip Habib for advice. He was under secretary of State for political
                    affairs at the time. Phil knew the Middle East as few did and took an interest
                    in his younger colleagues. I told him I was intrigued by Jerusalem. Jerusalem,
                    he replied was “the big time,” and I would be foolish to turn down such an
                    opportunity. Samuel Lewis was then our ambassador to Israel. He and I had known
                    each other since my early days in the Foreign Service, when we both worked for
                    under secretary Chester Bowles. Personnel had consulted him, and when the
                    assignment was made it had Sam's blessing.</p>
                <p>I had a general knowledge of the Middle East, thanks to Bayard Dodge's graduate
                    seminar at Princeton conducted in his living room on Mercer Street. My parents
                    had lived in Egypt from 1950-53, when my father was president of Mobil's company
                    there, and I visited them one summer while a graduate student. But I knew little
                    about Jerusalem, and would have to start from scratch. Most of my briefings were
                    arranged by a bright, precise, and exceptionally competent young officer named
                    James (Jock) Covey, who was then on the Arab-Israeli desk. He would later become
                    my deputy in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>The few consulates general in Jerusalem are unique in status. They are neither
                    embassies, nor traditional constituent posts. They function independently of
                    embassy supervision and report directly to their capitals at home. My efficiency
                    ratings would be written by the assistant secretary for the Middle East, not our
                    ambassador in Tel Aviv, guaranteeing independence in reporting on such topics as
                    Palestinian attitudes and Israeli settlements.</p>
                <p>The US view of Jerusalem is that it is a single, undivided city whose final
                    status can be determined only when the parties involved reach a mutually
                    satisfactory agreement. Until that happens, Jerusalem exists in a kind of limbo.
                    Its circumstances are different, however, from the limbo of Berlin, whose final
                    status was also undetermined during the Cold War, but defined by the outcome of
                    World War II and extensive quadripartite agreements reached by the occupying
                    powers. Jerusalem, fully occupied by Israel after the 1967 War, lacks any formal
                    legal definition of its status.</p>
                <p>Today, Israel has jurisdiction over all of Jerusalem. We and most other countries
                    officially regard a portion of the city, the former Jordanian-occupied East
                    Jerusalem, as “occupied territory.” We and most other countries have not located
                    our embassy in Jerusalem in recognition of other legitimate interests in its
                    ultimate status, and to encourage peaceful agreement in reaching accord on that
                    status. Settling the Jerusalem issue will probably be the last hurdle in
                    arriving at a comprehensive structure for peace in the region.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>When I arrived at Lod Airport in Tel Aviv in the winter of 1980, I was met by two
                    members of the consulate's staff, in whose company I drove for the first time up
                    the hills to Jerusalem. When we reached my future home and the garden gates
                    opened to let us in, I saw why this Ottoman residence was one of the most
                    striking properties our government owns abroad. Stately yet welcoming, its three
                    stories covered with vines climbing beyond high windows, it spoke of history. I
                    opened the front door and, like Alice through her looking glass, drew breath and
                    stepped into a new life. Once my suitcases were placed in an enormous bedroom
                    with a vaulted ceiling, I climbed the separate stairs to my office on the third
                    floor, with its lingering whiff of prewar times, and signed a telegram to the
                    State Department reporting I had arrived and taken charge.</p>
                <p>This was the extent of my official installation. I was not accredited to the
                    government of Israel and therefore did not have an exequatur, a formal document
                    normally issued to a consular officer by the host government acknowledging the
                    right of that officer to discharge consular responsibilities. I was able, as my
                    predecessors had been, to make calls on the foreign ministry in Jerusalem, where
                    I was acknowledged as an American official with consular authority in the city.
                    My calls were on the chief of protocol and head of the consular division. Both
                    were seasoned pros who received me graciously. We had the normal consular
                    workload: Americans getting arrested, being born, dying, losing their passports.
                    We did not issue immigrant visas, which was done in Tel Aviv. We were concerned
                    not only with Americans in Jerusalem, but also those on the West Bank, many of
                    dual nationality.</p>
                <p>Our consular district covered the city of Jerusalem and the West Bank, but not
                    Gaza. Gaza came under the purview of the embassy, a legacy from its occupation
                    by Egypt. I went to Gaza often and met socially with officials there, including
                    Mayor Shawwa. I liked Gaza which I had first visited in 1952, during a summer
                    with my parents in Egypt. Even then there were 200,000 displaced Arabs living in
                    UN refugee camps.</p>
                <p>My Berlin experience, with its emphasis on symbols and precedents, helped me in
                    Jerusalem. One such question was whether, and if so when, I should fly the
                    American flag on our official vehicle. While this may sound like a trivial
                    matter, flying a flag is a statement about the status of the occupant of the
                    vehicle. I was not the American ambassador to Israel, and Israelis regard
                    Jerusalem as their capital. I discussed the matter with Sam Lewis, and we agreed
                    I would fly the flag during official calls at the foreign ministry and on the
                    mayor, when attending national day celebrations of other consulates, and on
                    formal visits to patriarchs.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>All of the Israeli ministries, except defense, were located in Jerusalem.
                    Defense, for security reasons, remained in Tel Aviv. This required ambassadors
                    and several of their staff members stationed in Tel Aviv to drive back and forth
                    to Jerusalem, which took about an hour each way. Sometimes Lewis was obliged to
                    make the trip as many as three times in one day. Our consulate provided him and
                    his staff office space, communication facilities, food, drink, and a place to
                    rest. It was complicated and time consuming for everybody. We had a public
                    affairs officer, and commercial and trade promotion programs for Jerusalem and
                    the West Bank. We provided support to a half dozen American private voluntary
                    organizations working with great success and dedication on the West Bank. Ours
                    was the largest official foreign presence in Jerusalem, as it is nearly
                    everywhere, dwarfing the other consulates some of which were one-person
                    operations. We were responsible, too, for maintaining informal contacts with the
                    various religious denominations represented in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>The Vatican's representative was primus inter pares. France, Belgium, Holland,
                    Italy, Spain, Great Britain, Greece and Turkey also had their consulates general
                    in the city, as powers represented in Jerusalem during the Ottoman Empire. We
                    formed a small and close-knit consular corps, whose members bore
                    responsibilities similar to mine, except that the US was the only country that
                    did not include Gaza in its consular district, and I had no formal religious
                    responsibilities as most other consuls did.</p>
                <p>We had different degrees of access to the Palestinians, based upon traditional
                    ties and the politics of the moment. The US inevitably was cast in the role of
                    the “heavy” after the Camp David Accords, and the more radicalized Palestinians
                    refused to see American officials. Monthly meetings of the consular corps,
                    chaired on a rotating basis, amounted to discussions of how each of us viewed
                    the situation on the West Bank and in Gaza, and more broadly the
                    Israeli-Palestinian relationship. They gave me an opportunity to brief my
                    colleagues on the lack of progress in the peace process envisioned in the Camp
                    David Accords, and on US involvement in Lebanon through Phil Habib's
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>As a consular corps, we had formal and long-standing relationships with the
                    Greek, Armenian, and Russian Orthodox Patriarchs and the Vatican's
                    representative. For the US, these were matters of observing protocol and showing
                    good will. For the Greek, Italian, and Turkish consuls, however, religious ties
                    were their most important responsibilities. Dinners hosted by the Orthodox
                    patriarchs took place in a medieval court-like atmosphere. We were literally
                    “thumped” into the Patriarch's presence by a kawas, a uniformed Arab attendant
                    with a long and heavy metal-tipped staff which he banged loudly on stone floors
                    to clear an imaginary path through empty halls and announce our coming. It is a
                    particularly odd feeling to be calling alone and be preceded by a kawas. Except
                    for the austere quarters of the Vatican representative, the patriarchs in their
                    splendor left one wondering which century this was.</p>

                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Before I left Washington I was briefed on the ties between our embassy in Tel
                    Aviv and the consulate general in Jerusalem. Harold H. Saunders, then assistant
                    secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, a wise and gentle man, went over
                    that relationship with some care because historically it has been troubled.
                    Maintaining the independence of Jerusalem was important, and just as important
                    was that I be perceived as maintaining it, he said. There had been periods
                    during which ambassadors and consuls general were not speaking to each other.
                    Hal pointed out that Sam Lewis was a strong individual; he hoped I would resist
                    efforts by the embassy to encroach on my responsibilities. I said I had known
                    Sam for a long time, and had no reason to anticipate difficulties.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, Sam and I had an excellent relationship. We never had
                    differences concerning our respective roles or “turf.” There was a minimum
                    amount of friction between our staffs, because Sam and his DCM, and my deputy
                    and I, monitored the relationship carefully. Once, Sam asked whether he could
                    use my residence for a social occasion. He would be the host. I replied it could
                    cloud the US view of Jerusalem's status in other people's eyes. He pondered this
                    for a few moments and agreed.</p>
                <p>I attended the weekly country team meetings at the embassy in Tel Aviv, reporting
                    on West Bank developments and listening to discussions of US-Israeli relations.
                    When it was relevant, I provided a Palestinian perspective or urged the embassy
                    to take a particular initiative vis-a-vis the Israeli government with respect to
                    our concerns about Palestinians. I was included in various social events hosted
                    by the embassy staff, as were other members of the consulate, and we sometimes
                    added embassy staff to our guest lists in Jerusalem. Sam and I stressed that the
                    US had only one set of policies concerning Jerusalem and the West Bank.
                    Government officials and journalists heard the same line from me as they did
                    from Sam.</p>
                <p>Social occasions in Tel Aviv gave me an opportunity to provide Israelis the
                    flavor and mood of the West Bank. They were interested in the way someone
                    outside the always turbulent political situation in the capital saw it. Our
                    military attach�s in Tel Aviv reported regularly on the West Bank. One day,
                    driving to Tel Aviv shortly before Israel's invasion of Lebanon, I encountered a
                    long column of flatbed trucks carrying tanks from the south northward toward
                    Lebanon. I counted the tanks, and was able to provide timely information to our
                    military attach� for his reporting. Our cooperation was productive.</p>

                    and Arabs work side by side. When there were disputes, these had to do with
                    conditions of work, and were not politically motivated. I was struck by how
                    ready both sides were to live and work together. When a Palestinian employee had
                    a baby, Israeli staff members went to the hospital to see the mother and child.
                    The reverse was also true. Weddings were attended by both groups. We were, in
                    fact, a family at the consulate general. Most of the local staff had been
                    working there for many years. We had good jobs for Palestinians, and Israelis
                    also found satisfaction in working for the US government. The residence staff,
                    especially the gardeners, had been there for decades; most were Jordanians
                    living on the West Bank who stayed after the 1967 War.</p>
                <p>The major-domo in the residence, an all-seeing man in his sixties of unbounded
                    tact named Mohammed Latif, had been the major-domo in Amman when William B.
                    Macomber was ambassador there. Bill once visited me in Jerusalem, and these two
                    men fell into each others' arms. When I told Mohammed that Macomber would be
                    coming to dinner, he said Macomber had been easy to work for; all he ever wanted
                    for lunch was a hamburger.</p>
                <p>The American staff at the consulate general was small and its quality uniformly
                    good. Jock Covey, who soon became my deputy, was active in training our junior
                    officers of whom we had three at all times. When Phil Habib's Lebanese
                    negotiations intensified, we served as an executive secretariat to him. Our
                    staff worked hard and long hours. Backstopping Habib was rewarding for junior
                    officers learning how negotiations are conducted. They had responsibility and
                    tight deadlines thrust upon them and responded superbly.</p>
                <p>Even after 1967, when Jerusalem ceased to be a divided city, we kept our office
                    building in East Jerusalem and performed consular, information and cultural
                    functions in that building. The compound on Agron Road in West Jerusalem was
                    used by the consul general, and the political, economic/commercial, and
                    administrative staffs. The third floor of the residence was the consul general's
                    office. It could be reached directly; a visitor would not go through the living
                    quarters on the first two floors to get to the office on the third. Our 19th
                    century buildings in Jerusalem dated to Turkish times; we had owned them for
                    many years and been able to invest sufficient money to maintain them reasonably
                    well. The office floor housed communications equipment that weighed tons, and we
                    worried about the load, which, indeed, eventually became a serious structural
                    problem.</p>
                <p>The consul general's residence is known for its Ottoman character and
                    unselfconscious dignity. It speaks of other times in a pastoral Jerusalem of
                    wide roads and quiet, tree-filled gardens. The property is walled in. An oval
                    driveway encloses a lawn richly bordered by rose bushes and other plants. Tall
                    old trees provide shade. Built of large stone blocks, the front of the residence
                    is covered by flowering vines whose scent in spring seeps inside, and whose
                    green leaves in summer nestle it.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>One enters a stone floored hall: the rectangular, polished Jerusalem stone of
                    rose and yellow hue. A vaulted dining room is to the right and winding stone
                    steps lead to the floor above. The ceilings everywhere are high, and freely
                    moving air cools the house in summer. Plants on the steps bring in the garden.
                    The stairs emerge into the center of a large foyer on the second floor, the main
                    floor of the residence. To provide accent and orientation to this space, I
                    painted one of its walls a flat red ochre found in the public rooms of
                    Jerusalem's American Colony Hotel. To the right of the steps is the long living
                    room with its large oriental rugs, fireplace at one end, and vaulted white
                    ceilings above.</p>
                <p>Alone in that room overlooking the garden through the vines, I had feelings of
                    both possession and intrusion, an instinctive respect for the events that had
                    taken place there, and the people involved in them for over a century of
                    Jerusalem's life. The residence was permeated by echoes of its past. They made a
                    pleasant sound, and I thought myself the custodian of this old house and a
                    definer, for a brief time, of its future.</p>
                <p>If I speak in the first person singular, it is because my wife and I separated
                    before I went to Jerusalem for reasons of incompatibility. We had become distant
                    people with different interests. Our younger sons, Paul and Mark, lived with me
                    thereafter, and attended the Anglican School. Jack and Cathy, already in
                    Washington schools, visited during the summer while Paul and Mark were with
                    their mother. It was not easy, especially and sadly for the children, but we
                    managed well in the end.</p>
                <p>In the early 1980s, security in Jerusalem was not the problem it has become
                    today. I walked freely without a bodyguard, avoided crowds, and told my children
                    to do the same. My tour ended before the intifada, before fighting broke out on
                    the West Bank, and before Palestinians armed themselves with more than rocks and
                    stones.</p>
                <p>I began a typical day with an informal staff meeting in my office, after reading
                    the cables from Washington and our other posts and confirming that our reporting
                    was on track. I might next meet with Palestinians who wanted to talk with me,
                    and then have lunch with an American visitor, a journalist, or Sam Lewis if he
                    was in town. There were daily phone calls to our embassy in Tel Aviv, sometimes
                    on our secure phone which never seemed to work properly. Afternoons were often
                    devoted to calls on mayors and prominent figures on the West Bank, and
                    observations of settlements to note their relentless expansion. I would return
                    and have dinner with my sons and Israeli friends, or with Father Godfrey, a
                    close friend of our family, archeologist, and renowned tour guide to the holy
                    places of all religions. Those of us at the consulate general became his
                    personal flock, year after year. Throughout, I was assisted by one of the best
                    secretaries in the foreign service, Martha Hayward, with whom I had served in
                    West and East Berlin, and as country director for Panama.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>I did a considerable amount in media relations, although not publicly, meeting
                    with American journalists in my office or over a meal. I also saw locally based
                    reporters, whose families and mine became friends, and columnists and
                    commentators who traveled through the area, people like Rowland Evans and Tom
                    Brokaw of NBC. I have always liked journalists. They are wonderful sources of
                    gossip, humor, and insights. The good ones live in a world of realpolitik and
                    are not easily taken in. Only once was a confidence of mine betrayed, and that
                    accidentally.</p>
                <p>Rarely would an Israeli reporter ask to talk with me. I was friendly with people
                    on the Jerusalem Post, but wanted to keep a low public profile. In general, the
                    Israeli press and radio enjoyed criticizing the actions of our consulate. The
                    Israeli press is always lively, sometimes vicious. Few escape its barbs. There
                    was never any full-blown reporting on the consulate general, but we received
                    occasional digs about our visits to Palestinians. We were denigrated as
                    “Arabists” by the hardliners. I had even fewer contacts with the Arabic press;
                    most Arab journalists tended to be leftist, shrill, and vehemently opposed to US
                    policy, especially the Camp David Accords.</p>
                <p>The ways the words “Arabists,” as applied to Foreign Service officers, and
                    “balanced,” to characterize reporting or statements, are used by some Israelis
                    and their American friends bothers me. Today, an Arabist is someone who has
                    learned Arabic, studied the culture, and made the Middle East an area of
                    professional specialization. This is a necessary component in our diplomatic
                    skills, exemplified in the career of Ambassador Parker T. Hart. The word
                    “balanced” is made pejorative, connoting a prejudiced favoring of the Arab side.
                    Sometimes this happens, as does the reverse in Israel's direction, but we should
                    all be able to agree that balance is an intellectual accomplishment worth
                    striving for, especially in a diplomat.</p>
                <p>That said, there has historically been a bias toward Arabs among many of the
                    State Department's Middle East experts and vestiges of it remain. Some of this
                    is romantically based, as in the views of generations of British travelers and
                    explorers in the Arab/Muslim world, people like Charles Doughty and T.E.
                    Lawrence. Some reflects opposition to Israel's post-1967 settlement policies,
                    anger over its treatment of Palestinians, and resentment over the political
                    influence of Israeli lobbying in the US. “Who are the Palestinians?” Prime
                    Minister Golda Meir asked sarcastically at a press conference in the US in 1969.
                    Some of the concern, also, is based on economic realities and the international
                    politics of oil. It took Clark Clifford and President Truman's business partner
                    Eddie Jacobson to overcome State Department resistance in 1948, from Secretary
                    Marshall on down, to recognizing Israel. Until recently, few real Arabists
                    jeopardized their State Department careers by learning Hebrew and serving in
                    Israel. The personnel system took care that this did not happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>In my own family, my Polish-born mother, a product of middle-class Warsaw in the
                    early decades of this century, sometimes made anti-Semitic remarks. My father,
                    who became a leading expert in the corporate world on Middle East oil, did not,
                    but criticized Israel's frequent and evident disdain for Arabs. My summer paper
                    in graduate studies at Princeton, written after I visited my family in Cairo,
                    was entitled Dimensions of the Arab Case, because I thought, in 1951, that too
                    little was understood about the concerns of moderate Arabs about Israel. In it I
                    concluded that Arabs should accept the fact of Israel's existence and begin to
                    work out a way of life with her. I am not, however, an Arabist by anyone's
                    definition. In 1983, my prospective assignment as ambassador to Kuwait foundered
                    when the Kuwaitis turned me down as sympathetic to Israel on the basis of my
                    service in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Washington was greatly interested in Jewish settlements and their expansion, and
                    it was up to us to decide how to observe and quantify the frantic housing
                    construction around Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank. Palestinians saw the
                    consulate as the eyes, and especially ears, of the US government. To many
                    Israelis, however, we were diplomats whose activities were vaguely sinister.
                    Likud partisans occasionally raised a fuss about the activities of the consulate
                    general on the West Bank, usually in the media, where we were portrayed as PLO
                    sympathizers. I was never made to feel uncomfortable by ordinary Israelis,
                    however, who seemed to accept our presence and what we were doing as a matter of
                    course.</p>
                <p>With brutally repressive measures against Palestinians in force on the West Bank
                    and an expanding war in Lebanon, these were wrenching times for most Israelis. A
                    few of them refused invitations to our residence, seeing the consulate as a
                    symbol of imagined support for the PLO by the US government and an impediment to
                    Jerusalem's becoming the site for an American embassy. In fact, our firm policy
                    toward the PLO was to avoid all contact with that organization and its
                    representatives, and our views on the status of Jerusalem were equally public
                    and clear. The PLO was banned on the West Bank and we never knowingly met with
                    anyone from that organization, although its sympathizers were everywhere and
                    growing in number.</p>
                <p>There were also a few Americans, including visitors from our country, who would
                    not come to the residence for the same reasons. Most of them expressed their
                    opinions civilly; others felt less constrained. One of the most frustrating
                    situations for a diplomat abroad is an emotional attack on his government's
                    policies by fellow citizens who are biased or poorly informed, and want to stay
                    that way. To complicate matters further, the consulate general was in good favor
                    with elements of ultra-orthodox Jewry who believed Jerusalem should be an
                    entirely spiritual place, and not a capital for the state of Israel. Our
                    presence was viewed by them as desirable, and a constraint on the secular
                    ambitions of the Israeli government. They regularly attended our Fourth of July
                    celebrations.</p>
                <p>D The Camp David Accords</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>I arrived in Jerusalem 18 months after the Camp David Accords, which brought
                    peace between Egypt and Israel, were signed in mid-1978. One of my
                    responsibilities was to elicit support from Palestinians for those agreements
                    and the “autonomy” process for the West Bank and Gaza they envisioned. It did
                    not take me long to recognize we would not succeed. My colleagues at other
                    consulates accurately viewed Camp David as a dead issue. Washington nevertheless
                    remained committed to the Camp David “process.” While I had general guidance
                    from Washington, it was up to the consulate to be an advocate, devise a strategy
                    to meet US objectives, and keep Washington informed of the prospects. Rarely,
                    did we get specific instructions from Washington to do anything. In my three
                    years, I was instructed only once to go to the foreign ministry, and that was on
                    a consular matter.</p>
                <p>Consulate personnel were closely monitored by the Israeli security apparatus. I
                    was once introduced by Ambassador Lewis to Ariel Sharon, then defense minister,
                    at a social function honoring the arts at Lewis' residence in Tel Aviv. Sam, in
                    a burst of good will, hoped that by meeting me Sharon might become less hostile
                    to the consulate. Instead, Sharon said gruffly that he already knew who I was
                    and what I was doing. He was scathingly critical of me and my staff, whom he
                    accused of coddling the PLO. In some heat, I replied that because Mr. Sharon was
                    well informed he would know that no one at the consulate had any contacts with
                    the PLO. He turned his back to me and we left it at that.</p>
                <p>Sharon had difficult relationships with Americans who were not ardent supporters
                    of his views on settlements, Arabs, and the war in Lebanon. I found him an
                    extraordinarily complicated man, an amoral ideologue with a nasty agenda. To
                    him, every Palestinian is a terrorist and something less than fully human. His
                    unrelenting policy of paving the West Bank and Jerusalem's suburbs with
                    settlements is intended to make serious land-for-peace compromises impossible.
                    Over many years Sharon, in my view, has been inflicting great damage on the
                    prospects for peace in the Middle East, and therefore on Israel's, and everyone
                    else's, best interests.</p>
                <p>In April 1981 during Secretary of State Al Haig's first visit to the Middle East,
                    I briefed him over breakfast. I told him it was common knowledge among my
                    Israeli friends that Sharon was looking for any excuse to invade Lebanon to
                    settle the Palestinian issue once and for all by force. The invasion occurred on
                    June 6 as “Operation Peace for Galilee,” and its stated purpose was to remove
                    PLO forces from a 40-kilometer area north of Israel's border with Lebanon,
                    putting Israel out of range of PLO artillery. In fact, however, Sharon sought to
                    destroy the PLO leadership and remove it from Lebanon entirely, arrange for the
                    election of Bashir Gemayel as president of Lebanon, and then conclude a peace
                    treaty with Lebanon. The goal of expelling the PLO was accomplished; the other
                    objectives were not. Sharon was at this time still playing the dominant Israeli
                    role in the Camp David autonomy talks, thus demonstrating that the Israelis had
                    no intention of engaging in good-faith negotiations with Egypt and the US.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>Sam Lewis had long been skeptical about Sharon, and became increasingly
                    distressed as he saw what Sharon was up to in the invasion of Lebanon. I suspect
                    Foreign Minister Shamir and Sharon knew more about plans for an Israeli push all
                    the way to Beirut than Begin. Begin's subsequent depression, his withdrawal and
                    isolation, in part, I believe, reflected his recognition of Israel's
                    self-inflicted wound in Lebanon. He came to understand, as the coffins of young
                    Israelis kept returning, and after the massacres at Sabra and Shatila refugee
                    camps, what his cabinet had wrought and how much blood was on their hands.</p>
                <p>Sharon was a problem for everyone: for Sam, for Phil Habib, but especially for
                    peace-minded Israelis. As the Lebanese negotiations unfolded, Sam and Phil would
                    return to the consulate after having met with Sharon, often incredulous at his
                    outrageousness. Habib was always wary of Sharon, who seemed to all of us to have
                    an agenda of his own, no matter what his government's stated policy might
                    be.</p>
                <p>Israeli officials resented the consulate's reporting on their rapidly expanding
                    settlements, and on Palestinian views critical of Israeli activities. We
                    disciplined ourselves about what we said and wrote, and separated fact from
                    analysis. We made it clear to Palestinians that the US government had no
                    sympathy for the expansion of settlements, collective punishment of Palestinian
                    families, or acts of brutality by soldiers and settlers occurring with
                    increasing frequency on the West Bank. We also deplored Palestinian terrorism
                    and Arafat's role in it.</p>
                <p>Most Palestinians I met were well educated mayors and “notables,” university
                    professors, journalists, students, businessmen, lawyers and doctors. Few were
                    professional women. Most spoke English and had family or personal connections to
                    Jordan, where Amman was the source of financial support, passports, and other
                    amenities for the West Bank's Palestinians. The men drank coffee, smoked, and
                    talked politics endlessly, it seemed. A tedious part of my responsibilities was
                    to listen to the litany of complaints from Palestinians about US policy. Most
                    were not interested in hearing our views, and endlessly repeated set speeches
                    accusing us of being responsible for the West Bank's miseries because of our
                    financial and political support of Israel. They held us accountable for the
                    construction of settlements, claiming these were paid for by diversions of US
                    financial aid to Israel and financial support from American Jewish
                    organizations. After a while, these Palestinians would end their monologues and
                    get to more open discussions, although one could usually feel their bitterness
                    toward the US and resentment of the Camp David Accords, which were viewed as
                    legitimizing the Israeli status quo.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>Arabs of each village and city varied in temperament; at best, one did not sense
                    more than a loose coordination of views among the mayors in the early 1980s. The
                    more radical Palestinians, however, marched in lockstep. Elected officials, like
                    the mayors, talked to us without reservation and in the easy-going manner of
                    people whose lives are in politics. This was not always true for private
                    Palestinians, who tended to be more cautious if their ties to Jordan were
                    strong, or they were concerned about seeming too close to US officials promoting
                    the Camp David Accords. There were only a few occasions when it was not
                    “convenient” for a mayor to see me, and a suggestion was made that we meet the
                    following week. In general, access to Palestinians was not a problem.</p>
                <p>Palestinians were also bitter toward Egypt's President Sadat, co-signer of the
                    Accords. I was in Jerusalem when he was assassinated by his military officers,
                    and it wasn't long before Palestinians repeated the PLO line that his fate was
                    deserved because he was a traitor. The moderates who made such comments
                    surprised me. After Israel, Egypt was the strongest military power in the
                    region. The Camp David Accords neutralized that power, which radical
                    Palestinians saw as the only hope of one day regaining their territory and, in
                    the case of the fanatics among them, pushing Israel into the sea. Palestinians
                    resented President Carter as well, and were pleased when he lost his bid for
                    re-election. They had higher hopes for the Reagan administration, believing it
                    might repudiate Camp David. They particularly hoped the “autonomy” process would
                    be abandoned, and that the US would become less supportive of Israel. Of course,
                    none of this occurred.</p>
                <p>This was still a period when Palestinians were unarmed, and violent
                    confrontations with Israelis on the West Bank were not a daily occurrence.
                    Demonstrations did break out in violence, but Palestinians used stones then, not
                    guns. They burned tires, created black smoke, and blocked a few roads; they
                    rioted in refugee camps, but this was pre-intifada and weapons were used only by
                    Jewish settlers and military occupation authorities.</p>
                <p>Acts of terrorism within Israel, organized abroad by the PLO, Hamas and other
                    groups, were increasing in number and severity. Palestinians in general felt
                    themselves impotent victims of an occupation that became increasingly callous
                    toward their human rights and contemptuous of international standards defined in
                    the Geneva Conventions. Their fellow Arabs in the Gulf States and elsewhere sent
                    money but did not, in the eyes of Palestinians, appear seriously interested in
                    what was happening to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>A Palestinian I saw often was Mayor Elias Freij, of Bethlehem. He was an orthodox
                    Christian, a moderate, even-tempered, intelligent and moral man, someone who did
                    not whine, and who described the Palestinian dilemma in a larger perspective. As
                    a Christian, he did not have much influence on Muslim Palestinians. I often
                    brought visitors to him because he was eloquent, measured and credible in his
                    soft and patient voice, and because he lived in Bethlehem, which many Americans
                    wanted to visit in any case. Freij was effective in talking calmly and
                    rationally about Palestinian concerns, one of a small number of Arabs who could
                    do so. Yet he, too, strongly criticized the Camp David Accords as a sell-out to
                    Israel. Freij was critical of Arafat in his private conversations with me, but
                    never disavowed him as the legitimate leader of all Palestinians.</p>
                <p>Most other Palestinians with whom I spoke would not have dreamed of criticizing
                    Arafat. Freij had deeper insights and recognized that Arafat was not then
                    acceptable to the West because of his endorsement of terrorism and ambition to
                    destroy Israel, and his militant leadership of the PLO. Freij, always a
                    sensitive man of purpose and conviction, read the mood on the West Bank well. He
                    paid for his individuality by being something of a pariah on the Jordanian
                    political scene, and on one occasion having his home occupied by Israeli
                    soldiers for a number of days, for his “protection.”</p>
                <p>To get a different perspective, I saw, among many others, Karim Khalaf, the
                    former mayor of Ramallah, who was one of two mayors to lose their legs in car
                    bomb attacks perpetrated by a right-wing Israeli underground group. Khalaf lived
                    in Jericho thereafter, but I knew him earlier in Ramallah. Khalaf was a radical,
                    one of the most outspoken mayors on the West Bank, and a vocal critic of Camp
                    David. Even after his amputations, he never lost his fire. When I talked with
                    him in the shade of his garden of orange trees in Jericho, he was full of sparks
                    and anger about the Israelis and ourselves. He, too, was not interested in
                    hearing other views. But he was always, in the Arab way, a warm and welcoming
                    host, unhappy if you did not share coffee and food, and take some oranges
                    home.</p>
                <p>Shortly after my arrival in Jerusalem, Israeli occupation authorities deported
                    two West Bank mayors accused of being PLO-sympathizers across the river to
                    Jordan. They were widely respected leaders among the Palestinians, thoughtful
                    men of principle who were anything but demagogues. The world-wide publicity
                    generated by their deportations was more than the Israelis had bargained for.
                    Deportation left the families, who chose to stay on their land, in dire straits.
                    Western governments, including our own, protested these measures taken at a time
                    when we were clinging to the hope of implementing the Camp David Accords as part
                    of a peace process. To do this, we would need the support of West Bank mayors,
                    particularly those of stature.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>I decided to visit the wives and children of these mayors to ask how they were
                    faring, and repeated my calls when I returned to their cities. In Jerusalem, I
                    was pleased when the women stopped by my office. From comments made to me since
                    then, including those of one of the mayors visiting the United States some
                    fifteen years later, I now recognize that this gesture, which became well known,
                    probably was the most effective step I was able to take in three years to reach
                    out to Palestinians as a credible American official.</p>
                <p>E A Visit to Batir</p>
                <p>Mohammed Latif, our major-domo at the residence, lived in the village of Batir
                    near Jerusalem. One day, he invited my sons and me to his home for dinner. We
                    stopped to visit a friend of his in a village nearby, whose daughter had
                    accidentally been killed two or three days earlier by gunfire from the Israeli
                    military. Mohammed wanted us to meet her family. The girl's parents did not lash
                    out at me. They spoke of their grief quietly and with dignity. They said they
                    were unable to understand how the US could do nothing as violence increased on
                    the West Bank and innocent people were killed. They could not believe—few
                    Palestinians could—that we did not have the power to curb the Israelis if we
                    chose to.</p>
                <p>Sitting on their terrace in Batir at dusk, looking over the vineyards in the
                    valley and hearing the father speak of this experience pulled my thoughts and
                    feelings together. The mother had given me a photograph of her daughter, a
                    smiling girl in her late teens with dark, braided hair. The immediacy of their
                    loss was poignant, as were the composure and resignation with which it was
                    accepted and conveyed to me. No angry mob could have had anything like this
                    effect on my understanding of the human toll of the occupation. There was also,
                    I realized, a price paid by the occupiers, young soldiers who, for the most
                    part, found the brutal side of their orders repugnant. Violence during 1980-83
                    was spiraling. During one dreadful week, West Bank violence was the cover story
                    in Time, Newsweek, and The Economist.</p>
                <p>In Jerusalem that night, I wrote a cable, “The Dark Side of Israeli Occupation,”
                    drawing on the evening's conversation and its mood, trying to make a real person
                    of this young victim of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Rarely had our reporting
                    aroused so much comment. It struck a chord among colleagues in the Middle East
                    and Washington.</p>
                <p>F The “Village Leagues” Proposal</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>There were problems beyond violence on the West Bank, among them Sharon's plan
                    calling for the creation of “Village Leagues.” These were to be made up of
                    Palestinians imposed as unelected mayors and functionaries in cities that had
                    lost their mayors through deportation. Later on, they were to become a cadre of
                    Palestinians the Israelis intended to put in place under the “self-governing”
                    provisions of the Camp David Accords. These Palestinians had been selected by
                    military authorities because they were willing to cooperate. They were
                    quislings, as people on the ground including foreign journalists called them,
                    after the Norwegian collaborator with German occupation authorities in World War
                    II. Some, if not all, were in the pay of the Israelis. They were a mediocre lot,
                    whose experience had little to do with skills in governing, and whose
                    backgrounds were often shady. One of them, a notorious Israeli agent, had for
                    many months required open protection by Israeli soldiers at his home near
                    Hebron.</p>
                <p>Sad to say, there were people in Washington who insisted these quislings be taken
                    seriously and that the proposed “Village Leagues” be given US support as part of
                    the Camp David effort to achieve autonomy. They were officials outside the State
                    Department whose Likud sympathies were apparent. Our reporting for a while
                    focused on exposing the dubious credentials of these Palestinians, and the
                    Israeli government's cynicism in this effort. On the West Bank, it was essential
                    for us to distance ourselves from the “Village Leagues” proposal, which had
                    touched a raw nerve, if we were to maintain credibility and access to the rest
                    of the Palestinians. I became so disturbed about pressure from USIA, in
                    particular, that I sent a short, personal cable to Secretary of State Shultz
                    recommending that we avoid endorsing the “Leagues,” and discourage their Israeli
                    sponsors, if we wanted to retain what influence we had with the real Palestinian
                    leadership. Had it been implemented, the “Village Leagues” proposal would have
                    been the final coffin nail for the Camp David Accords. Eventually, this unworthy
                    enterprise collapsed, although for a long time our willingness even to consider
                    it left a bad taste.</p>
                <p>G Congressional Delegations</p>
                <p>Israel is an important port of call for any member of congress—like going to
                    Ireland or the Berlin wall—so we had many visitors either singly or as members
                    of congressional delegations. These CODELS arrived in Tel Aviv and then left as
                    soon as they could because the prime minister, religious sites, and photo-ops
                    were in Jerusalem. Each one had an embassy and consulate “control officer” to
                    organize their visits. Their arrivals and sojourns placed heavy demands on our
                    time and resources. I escorted them to the West Bank whenever they showed
                    interest in going there, and many did.</p>
                <p>I am a great believer in the value of congressional visits. We welcomed them even
                    in the overwhelming numbers that came to Jerusalem. Each visit provided an
                    opportunity to present the situation as we saw it, and enter into a dialogue,
                    sometimes profitable and always intense, with members of congress and their
                    staffs. Our visitors were a captive audience and were interested in
                    Palestinians, even those members of the House and Senate who favored Likud's
                    policies. By and large CODELS are serious trips undertaken for the primary
                    purpose of learning.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>The CODELS I briefed rather endlessly came in the wake of the Camp David Accords.
                    I often invited Palestinians to the residence to meet with American legislators
                    directly, and tried to get Palestinians themselves to present their views to the
                    CODELS. Occasionally, Palestinians refused to come in protest against the
                    congress, which they considered the instrument of their misfortunes through its
                    aid appropriations to Israel. I tried to expose visitors to a broad spectrum of
                    Palestinian views, but because some of the most articulate among them would not
                    come to my home, they threw away valuable opportunities to put their case to
                    American legislators.</p>
                <p>For example, Palestinians would not talk to Senator Howard Baker, then majority
                    leader and a very sensible man, because he was seen by them as opposed to their
                    cause. At the last minute, they baulked at attending my reception for him and
                    even persuaded the politically astute Mayor Freij to stay away in a show of
                    solidarity. I usually had little idea whether Palestinians would show up at a
                    reception before the event. Some I could invite for a small dinner, others would
                    only attend a larger function. When Palestinians did not appear at our reception
                    for Senator Baker, I explained why the boycott had occurred, and how misplaced
                    it was. Baker was disappointed, but understood. Palestinians were the losers
                    every time in these childish games.</p>
                <p>Two CODELS came often and stood out for their thoughtful approaches to the
                    region's problems. Congressman Steve Solarz, Democrat of New York, was one of
                    the hardest working members I have met. He ran us ragged on the West Bank every
                    time he came to Jerusalem. He became well acquainted with key Palestinians. It
                    was apparent to me, and to them, that he cared about their future. Steve told me
                    that as a congressman from Brooklyn, these visits with Palestinians were not
                    easy politically. I admired him for his intellectual curiosity and fairness, and
                    for the political risks he was taking at home in talking with Palestinians.</p>
                <p>The other exceptionally hard working visitor was Senator Paul Tsongas, a Democrat
                    of Massachusetts, who was of Greek origin. We always arranged for him and his
                    wife to meet the Greek Patriarch in Jerusalem and he, too, was intensely
                    interested in the West Bank and its Palestinians. While Solarz and Tsongas
                    remained exceptionally well informed on the West Bank, many other members and
                    their staffs made serious efforts to understand the complexity of the issues
                    symbolized by “unified” but divided Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>H Visit of Former President and Mrs. Carter</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>In March of 1983, former President Carter and his wife Rosalynn visited
                    Jerusalem, and for most of two days traveled on the West Bank. The three of us
                    sat in the back of his armored limousine, where Carter and Rosalynn usually held
                    hands and she kicked off her shoes. An Israeli security officer rode in front,
                    and a security car followed us. Carter, as the architect of the Camp David
                    Accords, was intensely interested in Palestinians and their views. This was his
                    first opportunity to see the West Bank. He called on some of the leaders, but
                    not all would receive him, as we had determined beforehand. In Jerusalem, I gave
                    a luncheon and a dinner attended by Palestinians, all moderates, who were eager
                    to talk with him. Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, had
                    developed a statistical data base for the West Bank, including settlements and
                    Israel's economic ties there. I arranged for him to give the Carters a briefing
                    which had evident impact on the former president who was beginning to understand
                    Palestinian life at first-hand.</p>
                <p>I invited the Carters and our by then exhausted staff on the evening before they
                    left to dinner at the Philadelphia Restaurant, our favorite place for Arab food
                    in the heart of East Jerusalem. My sons Paul and Mark, and Martha Hayward, were
                    there. To my surprise, Carter's security people were not unduly concerned. In
                    that noisy and informal ambiance, we were served a banquet at which plates of
                    cold dishes covered the table before the arrival of lamb, and arak was followed
                    by beer. Walid, the owner, buried any resentments about Camp David he may have
                    harbored. We had a lively, almost rowdy, time.</p>
                <p>In retirement, Carter seemed more relaxed and at peace with himself: not the man
                    of inner torments which often broke through his usual reserve when he was
                    president. His interest in the Palestinian-Israeli relationship was genuine, and
                    he felt sympathy for the Palestinians. By the end of his hard-working visit to
                    Jerusalem, Carter seemed to have no doubt that the benefits of Camp David were
                    limited to the rapprochement between Israel and Egypt he had done so much to
                    bring about. He could see for himself that formulas for Palestinian autonomy on
                    the West Bank and Gaza were unacceptable to the Palestinians. They were opposed
                    by the Arab states. King Hussein of Jordan had not been invited to Camp David,
                    and did not find himself in a position to provide the indispensable support
                    their implementation would have required—even had he wished to do so.</p>
                <p>Carter's lined face, with its muscles often tense, told much about his ability to
                    concentrate. His questions reflected the pragmatic, fact-gathering and
                    analytical bent of the engineer he had been. But he was also a man of emotions
                    who quite easily sorted data into moral categories of right and wrong. At the
                    Philadelphia Restaurant, his warmth, joviality and teasing nature came through
                    when he joshed with my sons and our staff and enjoyed his glass of arak.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>Carter's wife had great influence over him, and their devotion to each other was
                    touching in its directness. As Carter prepared for a press conference at the
                    King David Hotel on his last day, Mrs. Carter told me he would probably not ask
                    me what to emphasize, but I should offer my thoughts to him anyway. I did so,
                    even though his visit was a private one, and when he drew on my suggestions in
                    his remarks, she turned to me and said, “See, he's taking your advice!”</p>
                <p>Carter asked me to come to his hotel alone on the morning of his departure from
                    Jerusalem to find out whether I thought our ambassador, Sam Lewis, too readily
                    accepted the Israeli viewpoint on matters between us. At Camp David, he said,
                    Sam seemed to be repeating what Begin had just told him. I replied that Sam
                    recognized the complexities and nuances on all sides, but felt it was his
                    particular responsibility as ambassador to interpret to our government what
                    Israeli leaders were thinking, and why.</p>
                <p>In briefing visitors, Sam's enthusiasm and admiration for Israel sometimes
                    carried him away, as in his characterization of “tiny Israel” in the big Middle
                    East. But I rarely heard criticism from him of our reporting on the West Bank,
                    much of which, in its mere recounting, reflected discredit on Israel in ways Sam
                    understood and, albeit reluctantly sometimes, accepted. Our two posts functioned
                    independently of each other, an exceptional arrangement which through the years
                    has proven itself to be sound, even when relations between them were as
                    harmonious as Sam and I made them.</p>
                <p>I Other American Visitors</p>
                <p>I briefed leaders of the American Jewish Community when they came to Jerusalem,
                    and had good relationships with all of them. Sam Lewis gave me helpful advice
                    before I left Washington. He suggested I call on the Jewish leaders whose
                    headquarters were in New York. They should have an opportunity to meet me before
                    I left for Jerusalem, and express their views before I took up my duties. From
                    Tel Aviv, he helped make the appointments. I must have seen at least six heads
                    of various Jewish organizations, asking their advice and inviting them to visit
                    me.</p>
                <p>They took me up on this invitation, which helped develop some rewarding
                    relationships. When they visited Jerusalem, they listened to our briefings with
                    concern. A few traveled on the West Bank, often using me as their guide.
                    Sometimes I invited Palestinians to join us at the residence, if our visitors
                    wished me to, which most did. I had no problem getting Palestinians to come to
                    these functions. They were more tolerant of Jewish leaders than US government
                    officials. Their hostility was directed against US policy, not Americans or Jews
                    as such.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>Secretary of State Alexander Haig visited Jerusalem while I was there, as did
                    George Shultz, frequently. American official VIPs stayed at the King David
                    Hotel, near the consulate. They arrived at Lod Airport in Tel Aviv and headed
                    quickly to Jerusalem in a roaring motorcade. If it was the secretary, I would
                    meet him and his entourage at the hotel, along with the manager and additional
                    Israeli security agents. We would then wend our way through the crowded lobby
                    toward two small elevators.</p>
                <p>The question of who would ride with the secretary in such intimacy arose early in
                    my tour. Sam and I discussed the matter and Sam said I should do the honors. The
                    procedure was always the same. The secretary, a security guard, and I got into
                    the elevator and rode to the appropriate floor, usually in silence.
                    Photographers snapped pictures of us entering and exiting this small conveyance,
                    and that was the point. I always tried to look as if I had just learned
                    something important. We called this ritual “elevator diplomacy.” If only these
                    vertical boxes could talk, what tales they would tell! Before my time, Secretary
                    Kissinger and his little group once spent forty-five minutes together when the
                    elevator got stuck while they were on their way to dinner.</p>
                <p>For me, the most memorable elevator ride at the King David was on the way down
                    from former President Carter's top floor suite to the lobby, one evening near
                    the end of his visit in 1983. Mrs. Carter had felt slightly ill during the day
                    with symptoms of flu, and a doctor had been sent for. She was able to go out,
                    and the Carters, the doctor, a security agent and I filled the elevator as we
                    started off. Carter asked the doctor what was troubling his wife. “Mrs. Carter,”
                    came the answer, “has herpes.” The silence was awkward as we reflected on this,
                    eyes respectfully lowered. I wished I were at the Dead Sea rather than a few
                    inches from President Carter as he received this unsettling news. Herpes, the
                    doctor explained, takes many forms, including minor aggravations in the mouth,
                    and with the pills he prescribed all would be well in a day or two. Whew! Ground
                    Floor. Everybody out to face the tourists and cameras!</p>
                <p>The King David's VIP suites overlooked the old city, and the view was
                    breath-taking, particularly at sunset. Early in a visit, Sam and I briefed the
                    visitor or CODEL, often at the hotel, where we were mindful that we might have a
                    larger audience than just those of us in the room. We of course did the same for
                    Henry Kissinger when he came on a private visit. When the delegation was to pay
                    a call on the prime minister or foreign minister, Sam would be the escort; it
                    would have been inappropriate for me to go along, as my relations with the
                    Israeli government were circumscribed.</p>
                <p>J Jerusalem's Mayor Kollek</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>Jerusalem's renowned mayor, Teddy Kollek, was in office during my tour, as he had
                    been for many years before and was to be afterwards. When I arrived, I called on
                    him. It was a cordial but tough meeting. He told me he was trying to make
                    Jerusalem a united city, and the American consulate general was trying to divide
                    it. He pointed to the fact that we had two 4th of July receptions—one in West
                    Jerusalem, and the other in East Jerusalem for Palestinians. When June rolled
                    around, I sent out invitations to two 4th of July parties, as had been the
                    custom since 1948. Teddy Kollek went through the roof. He wrote an unkind letter
                    of protest to Sam Lewis, which Sam unhelpfully forwarded to me for reply.</p>
                <p>We did not want to hold two 4th of July receptions, of course, and were not
                    interested in exacerbating Israeli-Palestinian divisions. I believed, however,
                    that there was no other choice, and that the problem had not been created by the
                    US. If we had attempted to hold just one event, no Palestinians, in those days
                    of resentment about the Camp David Accords and the worst of West Bank violence,
                    would have come, creating a breach in our relations that would have been
                    difficult to repair. All of the other consuls felt obliged to hold two events on
                    their national days, something that seemed to trouble Kollek far less. I saw no
                    way to satisfy Kollek and at the same time continue our open, if not fruitful,
                    dialogue with Palestinians. I was able to bring Israelis and some Palestinians
                    together socially at my home, but during 1980-83 that would not have worked at a
                    public function.</p>
                <p>So, we had the Israeli community in the shaded summer garden of the residence,
                    along with many Americans living in Jerusalem and on the West Bank, journalists,
                    a protocol person from Kollek's office (the mayor himself would not come),
                    distinguished Israeli friends like the former chief justice and chancellor
                    Harman of Hebrew University, and the religious leaders. Our consular colleagues
                    also attended this pleasant, even elegant, garden party which, with women in
                    hats, many men in blazers, had a 1930s feeling to it.</p>
                <p>The second celebration was held the next evening in East Jerusalem, on the roof
                    of the American Colony Hotel. This was a smoky feast of grilled foods and Arab
                    dishes lit by strings of colored lights and noisily animated by sounds of Arab
                    music. I invited as many Israelis as I could to both celebrations. Palestinians
                    attended the party in East Jerusalem in great numbers, bringing their families
                    and uninvited friends. Journalists and some Israelis came to both events,
                    including Israeli reporters and columnists who enjoyed friendships with
                    Palestinians. Our consular colleagues came, and we partied into the night with
                    the Vester family who had so long been associated with the American colony.</p>
                <p>These 4th of July celebrations bedeviled us for the three years I was in
                    Jerusalem. I gritted my teeth and gave them anyway, and was finally able to
                    pacify Teddy Kollek in the matter. At stake, I told him, were our contacts with
                    even moderate Palestinians as conditions on the West Bank deteriorated, a
                    situation he also deplored. The US was second to none, I told him, in its belief
                    that Jerusalem was, and should remain, an undivided city. But we also had to
                    face realities of the times.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>Kollek and I became friends. He came to the residence often, where his preference
                    was to sit on the floor with his legs crossed. Guests would talk with him about
                    Jerusalem and his plans for its future. I took congressional delegations to see
                    him or, if their stay was short, hosted a reception and invited Teddy. I also
                    spent time with him planning visits of American officials, which brings up the
                    Weinberger precedent.</p>
                <p>During my time, when cabinet-level American officials visited Arab East Jerusalem
                    they would be escorted by myself or a member of my staff, but not Kollek or one
                    of his staff, although Teddy quite rightly considered himself mayor of the whole
                    city. In 1983, when Cap Weinberger, then secretary of defense, was scheduled to
                    visit Jerusalem, I cabled the State Department arguing that the practice of
                    having the consul general escort an American official within East Jerusalem,
                    while Kollek did the honors in West Jerusalem, was an anachronism. Kollek
                    justifiably resented this distinction, and Palestinians didn't care. I informed
                    the Department that unless instructed otherwise, I would ask Mayor Kollek to
                    escort Weinberger through East and West Jerusalem. Splitting the city in this
                    way was unseemly, and ran counter to our own interests. We had maintained for
                    years that Jerusalem was one city and yet, when it came to realities, we
                    sometimes treated it as two.</p>
                <p>I had called our desk officer in Washington, after having discussed my proposal
                    with Sam Lewis first, to alert the Department to this message. Go ahead, they
                    said, and see what happens. I called on Teddy to share the news. Before I could
                    open my mouth, he said to me in his gravelly voice that he knew why I was there,
                    and was sick and tired of the usual pitch about visitors. I told him to calm
                    down and listen. I was there to discuss the Weinberger visit. He said he didn't
                    want to hear about it. I then told him we were proposing that he escort the
                    secretary of defense through East and West Jerusalem. Teddy looked at me,
                    dumbfounded. He finally said: “God bless you!” Weinberger, Kollek, and I
                    traveled around all of Jerusalem in a mini-van. When we alighted inside the old
                    walls, Teddy turned to Weinberger and said: “You know, you are making history!”
                    Of course, I had briefed Weinberger and he understood the reference. This is
                    progress in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>I had a heartwarming relationship with Teddy Kollek, and admired him greatly. He
                    was held in esteem by most Palestinians who lived in Jerusalem, and did a lot
                    for them. They trusted him. I don't remember ever hearing a Palestinian say
                    something nasty about Kollek. He was what we would call a ward politician with
                    street smarts, a big heart, and a great personal touch, a man of the people. He
                    took enormous pride in the acres of flowers he planted in Jerusalem. There were
                    many parks, and the boulevards were divided by flower beds. Driving around the
                    city in his battered Volkswagen Beetle, Teddy occasionally spotted someone
                    picking a flower. He would slam on the brakes and pounce on the unlucky
                    individual. “What would happen to this city if everybody picked its flowers?” he
                    bellowed. The subject of this tirade from the mayor would be mortified, but what
                    can you do with a flower once you have picked it?</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>Teddy made a political error: he stayed in office too long. I think he could have
                    become prime minister if the Labor Party had chosen him. No one had better ties
                    to Americans. But he was not willing to abandon his first love, Jerusalem. It
                    was already too late for Kollek on the national scene when I was there. He
                    stayed as mayor until voted out. Time passed him by, and from his small,
                    second-floor apartment he has lived to see his Likud successor restore the walls
                    between people he did so much to break down.</p>
                <p>K Places on the West Bank and Gaza</p>
                <p>Some Palestinian villages and cities remain sharply etched in memory. Bethlehem
                    is not at all the “little town” of Christmas carols, but rather a sprawling,
                    undistinguished even ugly place teeming with hawkers of religious souvenirs.
                    Mark Twain caught its flavor in Innocents Abroad.</p>
                <p>Hebron is a city that disturbs me in a visceral way. There is something dark and
                    menacing about it. A great unholiness resides there. By 1980, a settlement
                    flourished in the heart of Hebron, established by a small group of radical
                    Jewish settlers, some of them from Brooklyn, in an old building next to a
                    mosque. On the roof of this building, one could see a guard post manned by
                    settlers conspicuously brandishing their Uzis, which gave it the look of a
                    military fortress, a jarring in-your-face message to the Arab population. One
                    sensed catastrophies waiting to happen. When a settler shot dozens of Arab
                    worshipers in the Hebron mosque several years ago, I was not surprised.</p>
                <p>Nablus is a distinctive city perched on its hills with a certain grandeur. In my
                    time, it also was the most hostile and volatile place on the West Bank. It is
                    geographically removed from the central cluster of West Bank communities, and
                    Palestinians seem a bit different there. Violent demonstrations were frequent in
                    Nablus; it was in Nablus that stones were thrown at my car by teenagers. The
                    city was radicalized in a palpable way.</p>
                <p>The Al-Masri family in Nablus were friends. One of the brightest young men in the
                    family, Zafer, was exceptionally courageous in his political moderation as the
                    city's mayor. He knew the US well; members of his family had been educated
                    there. I became acquainted with him, his lovely and politically attuned wife,
                    and their children, who visited me in Jerusalem. Zafer paid for his courage. He
                    was assassinated by radical Palestinians after I left Jerusalem. It was in
                    Nablus that one found Palestinians punishing their kin for the sin of political
                    moderation. Zafer's death was a great and painful loss to the Palestinian
                    cause.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>Then there was Gaza with its refugee camps, a powder keg in search of a match. I
                    had good friends in Gaza, and came to understand the dynamics of the area: its
                    poverty and restlessness, feelings of confinement, its aura of being overwhelmed
                    by history. Arafat, today, is having difficulty exerting his authority over the
                    Gaza strip. He is not a good administrator to start with, but Gaza is an
                    ungovernable entity. Gaza's refugee camps were densely crowded shacks lined up
                    along the sea shore, littered with refuse, filthy. They were made of corrugated
                    metal or anything else that would stand, one next to the other for miles.
                    Children were everywhere and population growth was high. There was enough food
                    to keep people alive at modest levels, but the area was seething with pent-up
                    anger exacerbated by the lack of jobs—and hope. Some fished, for themselves and
                    as a business; many of the men worked in Israel as day laborers or pickers in
                    the orange groves. It was sobering to observe such squalor and misery and wonder
                    what Gaza's future might be. I never walked through the camps, but passed
                    through them with my Arab driver. I saw other camps on the West Bank, such as
                    the large one outside Bethlehem, but none as spiritless as Gaza.</p>
                <p>My Palestinian contacts had little to do with the refugee camps, although they
                    mentioned these camps and their problems to me often. Mayor Freij of Bethlehem
                    and other Palestinians were concerned about the camps, but did not consider
                    themselves spokesmen for the refugees beyond deploring camp conditions and the
                    reasons for there being refugees in the first place. They accepted the presence
                    of refugees as facts of life under occupation.</p>
                <p>The mayors were more concerned about the potential for violence stemming from
                    conditions in the camps, and the presence of so many young men with nothing to
                    do. In fact, the refugees were not represented by anyone; they did not have a
                    voice in the early 1980s. We would hear about them when problems arose, but they
                    were successfully marginalized. We supported the valuable work of private
                    voluntary agencies and UNRWA, efforts backed by many of the world's governments.
                    But the refugees were not themselves a coherent political force; they simply
                    existed in the West Bank and Gaza in large multiplying, unemployed numbers.</p>
                <p>L The Habib Negotiations</p>
                <p>Israel's invasion of Lebanon on June 6, 1982 was the dominating event of my tour.
                    As we watched the crisis mount, Israeli forces moved into Lebanon in an
                    operation cynically called “Peace for Galilee.” We thought, initially, that
                    their forces would stop forty kilometers north of the border. But they kept
                    moving, and it slowly became clear that Defense Minister Sharon intended to go
                    all the way to Beirut to expel the PLO and arrange for the election of Bashir
                    Gemayel as president of Lebanon. The Israelis suffered heavy casualties. As
                    these mounted, and the purposes of the invasion became clear, the mood in
                    Jerusalem changed.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>The incursion polarized Israeli society as never before. Many Israeli friends
                    asked: “What have we come to? What is this country about in Lebanon and on the
                    West Bank?” Peace Now adherents were the most vocal in their opposition,
                    followed by the Labor Party. A whole country was having an identity crisis. Many
                    Israelis were morally outraged at Begin's government and its purported rationale
                    for the invasion. There were demonstrations and vigils in front of the prime
                    minister's residence, a few blocks from the consulate. When the Sabra and
                    Shatila massacres occurred at Palestinian refugee camps in September, 1982
                    people viewed Sharon as responsible. Israelis and Palestinians alike were
                    horrified.</p>
                <p>Israeli anxiety was reinforced by the flow of soldiers returning from the front
                    in coffins. Jerusalem's atmosphere is often tense and somber, but during the
                    Lebanon crisis it was funereal. National schizophrenia took hold. As bad news
                    from Lebanon flowed in day after day, the depression deepened. Jerusalem's
                    universities, its scholars and religious leaders, provide the city moral
                    authority and make it a repository for national values. Jerusalem cherishes its
                    memories of the founding of the State of Israel and the collective conscience of
                    its founders, and now the very meaning of Zionism was challenged.</p>
                <p>Into this atmosphere came Philip C. Habib, assisted by Morris Draper, as leader
                    of a US negotiating team seeking to dislodge Arafat and his fighters from
                    Lebanon. Subsequently, Habib would broker a peace among Lebanese factions and
                    attempt to end the war itself. I had no idea, nor did Phil at the outset, of
                    what was in store for all of us.</p>
                <p>I encountered Phil at my first post, Abidjan, in 1960, when he came through the
                    region gathering material for his National War College paper on Africa. Ever
                    buoyant, he and the consulate's American secretary, Marion Markle, had a
                    memorable picnic trip by Volkswagen Beetle into the rain forest, where in
                    village after village Phil sought out Lebanese shopkeepers to practice his
                    Arabic. Marion reported that he received a hero's welcome. Phil had visited me
                    in Jerusalem earlier, when he was trying to rekindle negotiations between Jordan
                    and Israel on riparian issues involving the Jordan River. He had barely begun
                    this work when President Reagan named him as his personal envoy for the larger
                    issues of Lebanon.</p>
                <p>Phil became a frequent guest at the residence. I insisted he stay with us rather
                    than at a nearby hotel, because we had more comfortable quarters and he was
                    better protected there. He could hold meetings at any time under secure
                    conditions. Our offices and communications facilities were a floor above the
                    living quarters and provided immediate support.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>Phil loved staying at the residence for its spacious and cool comfort and the
                    quality of the household staff, particularly the talents of Atta, our Arab cook.
                    In typical Habib fashion, he complained that his shirts were ironed better at
                    the ambassador's residence in Beirut. He gorged on the Lebanese pistachio nuts
                    we put before him. He loved the rose garden. At my urging, after his death, a
                    plaque was placed in the garden honoring him and his love of roses. Phil spent
                    time with me, just musing and chatting. He found the residence a calming shelter
                    from the world beyond its walls. There were days when he arrived worn out. Phil,
                    at 63, had experienced two heart attacks, and the negotiating process was
                    grueling. From time to time, I arranged for an Israeli cardiologist to show up
                    at the residence. Phil grumbled a bit, but was pleased to have a check-up. His
                    concern was that these calls would leak to the press, but they never did.</p>
                <p>When his motorcade arrived, I met Phil at the front door and took him to the
                    guest room, where he unpacked his bag and hung up his suits, which were always
                    in plastic dry cleaning wrappers. An excellent way to keep the wrinkles out, he
                    reminded me. He stripped to his boxer shorts and tee-shirt, stretched out on the
                    bed, and started talking. Phil invariably asked about my children, and how the
                    household staff was faring. We discussed the garden and agreed it needed his
                    scrutiny, an issue of priority on his personal agenda. He shared his concerns
                    about the work at hand. Then he dozed off.</p>
                <p>For Phil, the negotiations were arduous, frustrating, and often disappointing.
                    Phil instinctively understood the Lebanese and their Syrian masters lurking in
                    the background. Washington had given him a near carte blanche to resolve the
                    issues in PLO withdrawal and the larger peace effort. On the phone, he dealt
                    with Near East assistant secretary Veliotes on day to day matters, and
                    occasionally with Secretary Shultz, an old California friend. He also spoke
                    frequently with NSC adviser Bud McFarlane. There were occasional bursts of
                    shouting from Phil, but he generally found the Washington bureaucracy
                    supportive. Ambassador Lewis shared fully in these matters. He and his committed
                    staff, including Charlie Hill, Bill Brown, and Paul Hare, became nearly as worn
                    down as Phil as they produced reams of reporting cables.</p>
                <p>It was the Israeli government that troubled Phil most. He had direct access
                    anytime to Prime Minister Begin, but sometimes found him removed from Phil's
                    immediate concerns. While Phil encountered warmth and support in many government
                    quarters, particularly the foreign ministry, he found these qualities lacking in
                    Defense Minister Sharon, whom he distrusted and disliked. The massacres at the
                    refugee camps in Lebanon upset Phil greatly. He was frustrated by infighting in
                    Lebanon among the various factions and their inability to act together. His
                    Lebanese origins seemed to have no influence on his views or emotions, but
                    helped him understand the mindset and negotiating styles of his counterparts in
                    Beirut. During each visit Phil asked me to brief him about the situation on the
                    West Bank, which was always grim. He was careful to keep these matters separate
                    from the concerns of his negotiations, but on a couple of occasions agreed to
                    pass along comments and advice about the West Bank where it was most likely to
                    do some good in Begin's government.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>One afternoon, Phil was in a good mood and looking for something to do. I
                    suggested we visit the collection of Roman glass at the Israel Museum, one of
                    the best collections, if not the foremost, in the world. The museum was close
                    and he agreed to go. When we entered the rooms where the glass is exhibited,
                    Phil lost himself. He became engrossed in shapes and colors, and for a long time
                    walked from one beautifully lit display case to another, totally absorbed. It
                    was one of the few times I lured him out of the residence. Arab feasts with
                    family and staff at Walid's Philadelphia Restaurant constituted the others. Phil
                    cherished the quiet solitude provided by the residence and its garden.</p>
                <p>Phil was fond of my children, two of whom lived with me, and two others, Cathy
                    and Jack, who visited from college in the summer. He would greet my youngest son
                    Mark at the breakfast table with a hearty, “Good morning, smartass!” He was a
                    warm and funny person, despite his often stern demeanor. Phil's daughter Phyllis
                    spent some time with us, and we tried to make her feel part of the family.
                    Occasionally, I would host small dinners for him to which I invited UNIFIL
                    officers, journalists, and other interesting people in Jerusalem. Phil was a
                    great dinner companion and raconteur. He liked good wine. “Dining is the soul of
                    diplomacy,” Lord Palmerston observed. Whenever Brian Urquhart of the UN was in
                    Jerusalem, I asked him to dinner with Phil. It was fascinating to hear their
                    assessments and reminiscences. Brian, as well, had a deep and intuitive
                    understanding of Lebanon and the Middle East.</p>
                <p>We were stretched thin in the consulate when Phil was in town. Martha Hayward,
                    ever a tireless secretary, saved us time and again. These visits were a workload
                    for which we were not prepared. My undaunted deputy, Jock Covey, took on this
                    chore, having had invaluable staffing experience in the State Department's
                    executive secretariat. We trained our junior officers to put together briefing
                    books, sort cables, and staff the needs of a busy negotiator. They took to this
                    work like bees to honey, and enjoyed their easy access to Phil. Phil in turn,
                    took an interest in them. He asked about their careers, past and prospective,
                    and why they had joined the Foreign Service, amplifying everything with his
                    usual wisecracks. The junior officers loved it, and vied for the demanding
                    responsibility of taking care of him. Many of them received quick promotions and
                    were recognized by the State Department for their outstanding work in Jerusalem.
                    The lesson in this is that foreign service professionals like to work with
                    strong leaders engaged in important issues. They will give their all in response
                    to wise leadership from someone whose understanding and management of matters at
                    hand commands respect.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>On one of his visits to Jerusalem, Phil was unhappy about his support from our
                    embassy in Lebanon. He was about to return to Washington for a meeting with the
                    president, and told me he intended to ask Reagan to appoint me ambassador to
                    Lebanon forthwith. I thanked him for his confidence and said I needed to sleep
                    on it, although I knew what my answer would have to be. At breakfast the next
                    morning, I told Phil it would not be possible for me to go. I had a commitment
                    to my sons living with me that I could not abandon when they were at an age at
                    which a father's guidance is badly needed. The divorce had been hard on them.
                    Phil made his disappointment clear—he was a great believer in “the Foreign
                    Service first”—but accepted my decision, frowning at me from time to time later
                    on, grumbling that I should have gone to Beirut. Had I done as he wished, I
                    would have been at our embassy when it was blown up in a terrorist attack.</p>
                <p>Habib's temper was legendary, and his blow-ups were memorable though brief. Nick
                    Veliotes, then assistant secretary for the Middle East, tells the story of one
                    of Phil's quick visits to Washington during the Lebanese crisis. Phil asked Nick
                    to draft a telegram on some complicated matter, which Veliotes and his
                    associates promptly did. The draft was handed to Phil, who retreated into Nick's
                    office and closed the door, while the others waited outside in trepidation. Sure
                    enough, the outburst came: “GOD DAMN IT!” Phil yelled to their dismay. “Why
                    can't the rest of the Department do work like this!”</p>
                <p>Habib had a wise press policy. When he went to the foreign ministry at the outset
                    of his negotiations, he was confronted after the initial discussions by a huge
                    jumble of TV cameras and journalists. Phil, undaunted, went to the microphones,
                    looked straight into the cameras and said: “Ladies and gentlemen, this is going
                    to be a silent movie!” He surveyed the startled faces for a few seconds, and
                    left. He would not speak to the press during the negotiations, except for an
                    occasional formal statement. He believed that one cannot negotiate in public.
                    The Israeli press, moreover, was notorious for its flights of fancy and
                    tenacity.</p>
                <p>In the early days of his negotiations, Phil received kudos by the gross. One
                    week, he was on the covers of Newsweek and Time. After Arafat's exit from
                    Beirut, he was increasingly mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.
                    When Phil returned to Washington for consultation, President Reagan usually
                    invited him to lunch. Habib was the star of US foreign policy. That reputation
                    changed after a suicide truck bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut killed
                    241 Americans in October of 1983, the worst of times for Americans committed to
                    peace in the Middle East by their presence, actions and cautious hopes.</p>

                <p>One of my reasons for returning to Washington for consultations in the spring of

                    longer be held together. Mary, living in Washington, had changed lawyers, and a
                    new one was starting to work with her. One afternoon, as I briefed members of
                    the policy planning staff in the State Department on Jerusalem and the
                    Palestinians, two federal marshals appeared in the outer office with a warrant
                    for my arrest under a writ of ne exiat, which a judge issues when someone is
                    believed to be intending to flee the country to avoid the law. They ordered me
                    to leave the building with them, and frisked me in a men's room. We drove to the
                    District of Columbia Jail where I spent the next two hours in a private cell.
                    With time to think, once I had overcome my shock, I recognized this legal
                    tactic, intended to embarrass me and hurt my reputation, which it briefly did to
                    some extent, was so off the wall it would probably help me in divorce
                    proceedings, which it also did. My lawyer delivered a thousand dollars in cash
                    to bail me out and I breathed free air again.</p>
                <p>The next morning, an irritated judge vacated his own order and rebuked Mary's
                    lawyer for employing this strategy. In its Washington gossip column a few days
                    later, however, The New York Times alluded to the incident without mentioning my
                    name, lightheartedly characterizing me as a foreign service officer involved in
                    a divorce frantically trying to elude federal marshals in the State Department's
                    corridors. The writer seemed to find in this fantasy a characterization of the
                    Foreign Service itself.</p>
                <p>N Middle East Peace</p>
                <p>I left Jerusalem in early summer 1983, thoroughly discouraged about the future of
                    the West Bank and Gaza. The Camp David process had run its brief course. I saw
                    no prospect any time soon for the creation of a respectable entity Palestinians
                    could call their own. They were at their most despairing, a mood that erupted
                    four years later in the intifada uprising which introduced armed clashes, for
                    the first time, into the occupied territories themselves. Moderates in Israel
                    and among Palestinians hunkered down to wait for change.</p>
                <p>And, finally, change did come at the Madrid Conference of October 30, 1991, an
                    event that could not have happened during the Cold War. Presidents Bush and
                    Gorbachev, the latter with only two months left in office, together brought to
                    the table in Madrid representatives of Israel, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,
                    and the Palestinians. Nothing comparable had occurred since the creation of
                    Israel in 1948 at the Cold War's onset. Much of the credit belongs to Secretary
                    of State James Baker.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>The fact that the Soviet Union no longer existed, and Syria and the PLO had
                    therefore lost its support, made the decisive difference. With Cold War
                    competition over, Russia and the United States saw their interests beginning to
                    converge and joined forces in the Middle East. The Madrid Conference broke the
                    downward spiral in Arab-Israeli relations, although beyond its symbolism in
                    post-Cold War realignments, it amounted to little more than a new format for old
                    problems. In the Middle East, however, formats matter. The struggles between
                    Israelis and Palestinians are not in the main religious, but secular. They are
                    about land, water, security, dignity, and freedom in its many forms. Whose land,
                    today, is the West Bank and Gaza, and whose city is Jerusalem? By what
                    rights—biblical, historical, conquest, deed, use or occupation—do these lands
                    belong to Arabs or Jews?</p>
                <p>Progress toward peace was made under the 1993 Oslo Declaration of Principles,
                    signed on the White House lawn one hot September day by Prime Minister Yitzhak
                    Rabin, soon to be assassinated as Sadat had been, and PLO President Yasser
                    Arafat. The accords had been reached without US participation or knowledge. At
                    the White House ceremony on the lawn, I watched these former adversaries
                    hesitate—and then shake hands, and I joined in the emotional ovation. With
                    President Clinton standing in the middle, as Carter had stood with Begin and
                    Sadat, the scene rekindled a fragile flame of hope.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, in a dangerous and inexplicable strategy, Prime Minister Netanyahu,
                    abetted by Sharon as Minister of National Infrastructures, is creating new
                    settlements in Jerusalem and on the West Bank, more facts on the ground, as his
                    critics say. He adheres minimally, if at all, to the spirit of the Oslo
                    Declaration. Arafat, on his part, is showing himself, so far, to be the weak
                    leader and poor administrator of a corrupt Palestinian Authority, failing to
                    control terrorism and rioters, or discipline Palestinian police in cities such
                    as Gaza and Hebron.</p>
                <p>Regarding Jerusalem, I suspect that a generous formula for religious sovereignty
                    and Palestinian rights will eventually prove acceptable, one that guarantees
                    access and control of holy places to the concerned parties in an open city that
                    serves, by common consent, as Israel's capital, and perhaps even Palestine's.
                    When that happens, the United States will move its embassy. The US role as peace
                    broker in the Middle East remains indispensable and, like Phil Habib, we must
                    not give up. The Cold War's outcome augments the diplomatic options. The lesson
                    of Oslo is that Americans, Israelis, and Palestinians are not alone in these
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>My years in Jerusalem were difficult and painful for everyone. And yet, Val
                    Vester, still at the American Colony Hotel, wrote to me fifteen years
                    afterwards: “I think you would hate Jerusalem if you saw how it is now, so built
                    up and surrounded by high-rise fortresses...I look back on the period that you
                    were here as a very happy one.”</p>
                <p>16TURNED DOWN BY KUWAIT: 1983-84</p>
                <p>A The Meaning of Agr�ment</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>I returned to Washington from Jerusalem in 1983, expecting to become ambassador
                    to Kuwait. Nick Veliotes, assistant secretary for the Near East, called me in
                    Jerusalem to propose this assignment and urge me to accept it. I was pleased at
                    the prospect of heading an embassy in a region that interested me. There was
                    reportedly a good school available for my son Mark.</p>
                <p>One evening I received a call from Jock Covey, my former number two in Jerusalem
                    who had become a deputy executive secretary of the State Department. He told me
                    the Kuwaitis had refused to agree to my appointment. The Kuwaiti foreign
                    minister had taken our request for agr�ment to Amir Shaykh Jabir to tell him the
                    US was proposing an ambassador who favored Israel, as evidenced by his service
                    in Jerusalem. This caused the Kuwaitis not only to deny agr�ment—the formal
                    request from one government to another to agree to a proposed ambassador—but to
                    do so publicly and angrily. There was no turning back for them after that.</p>
                <p>This decision caused a certain amount of commotion. Larry Eagleburger, then under
                    secretary of state for political affairs, and Nick Veliotes were outraged, both
                    on the basis of the Kuwaiti view, and their behavior as a friend of the US. My
                    nomination to Kuwait came in the aftermath of Israel's invasion of Lebanon, and
                    the US-supported ouster of the PLO's leadership from Beirut. Emotions in the
                    Middle East were churning. Kuwait's refusal of my nomination became front page
                    news in the US media, a momentary metaphor for America's frustrations in the
                    Middle East.I received support from Israeli friends in the form of letters to
                    editors and journalistic comment. Jerusalem's mayor Teddy Kollek wrote:
                    “Brandon, sorry for all the troubles you had because of your Jerusalem
                    assignment. Yours, Teddy.” Palestinian friends on the West Bank and in Gaza
                    wrote to me expressing their embarrassment.</p>
                <p>Refusal to grant agr�ment is rare, but in 1983, at about the same time, my
                    colleague Morton Abramowitz was turned down by the Indonesian government because
                    he is Jewish. The two of us became examples of the pitfalls of a diplomatic
                    career. Mort and I found ourselves the subjects of a lead editorial in The New
                    York Times; the US government, in its turn, had refused a woman nominated by the
                    Sandinistas in Nicaragua, believing she had been involved in the murders of
                    associates of Somoza by first luring them to her bedroom. The agr�ment process
                    became a brief flash in the American consciousness. I understood then what Andy
                    Warhol meant about fifteen minutes of fame.</p>
                <p>The State Department's response was to make it clear to the Kuwaitis that they
                    had seen their last American ambassador for some time. It would be a year before
                    the US proposed another ambassador, Anthony C.E. Quainton, and before the
                    Kuwaiti ambassador in Washington was received by a senior official in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>Left in limbo, Mort and I were well treated at State. Our seniors in the
                    Department promised they would find other posts. But embassies are not readily
                    available. Usually ambassadorial appointments are planned six to nine months
                    before a vacancy occurs; no post would open up in the immediate future. The
                    hardest thing was to find a school for Mark that late in summer. Mrs. Santora,
                    at Holy Trinity in Georgetown, could not have been more understanding and God
                    bless her for that!</p>
                <p>Management issues have always interested me, so I asked to be temporarily
                    assigned to M/MO, then the office responsible for the State Department's
                    organizational and resource issues. It was headed by a friend, Willard A. De
                    Pree. I told Bill that if he could use me I would be delighted to join him. I
                    worked on four projects during my tour in M/MO. Many months later, I realized
                    that had my assignment to Kuwait proceeded without a hitch, Mark and I would
                    have been there during a terrorist attack that heavily damaged our embassy
                    compound.</p>
                <p>B Communications Policy</p>
                <p>My first assignment dealt with communications and information policy (CIP), then
                    coordinated in the office of the deputy secretary of State. The question was
                    where to locate this function, which involved policy, negotiations, export
                    concerns, and the gamut of issues in computers and information flows. I had
                    little knowledge of these matters, but soon became engrossed in them. It was my
                    first experience with the implications of information technology. In 1983, there
                    was minimal awareness of the impact of the Third Wave, the Information Highway,
                    or the communications revolution in general in the State Department. The deputy
                    secretary's special assistant for these matters, Ambassador Diana Dougan, was
                    reluctantly supported by the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (EB), and
                    largely ignored. One of the pressures facing the Department came from
                    congressional quarters seeking to have US interests in communication and
                    information issues centrally managed.</p>
                <p>Diana Dougan, the sole official in this function, was a highly competent Reagan
                    appointee with a strong private sector background in communications. I spent
                    three or four months working my way through these complexities and, at the end,
                    produced a report entitled “CIP: A Bureau in the Making.” It concluded, over the
                    fierce opposition of the EB Bureau, that the Department's communications
                    responsibilities should be separated from that bureau and placed in a new,
                    discrete organization. I recommended that the Department concentrate more
                    intensively and systematically on communications issues and that State, not the
                    Department of Commerce, be the leading agency on policy relating to the
                    international implications of communications issues, including US exports of
                    communications technology.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>My report focused on capabilities the State Department must find in its own
                    expertise to address policy aspects of complex international scientific or
                    technology issues. Were we able to deal with communications policy when the
                    subject was so esoteric? We did not yet train foreign service officers to be
                    competent in science and technology, or to speak their languages, and often
                    ignored these skills when they were present in people we already had.</p>
                <p>I concluded that a foreign service officer who understood US interests and the
                    policy aspects of technical issues would be able to address international
                    concerns and recommend courses of action to serve those interests. In
                    negotiations, such a diplomat would be supported by technical experts. These
                    conclusions were reinforced by earlier experiences on the Policy Planning Staff
                    with Law of the Sea negotiations, during which I learned that one can take
                    extraordinarily complex questions, distill their policy essence, and provide the
                    necessary policy guidance at political levels. Foreign policy judgments and
                    conclusions about US international interests cannot be left to the scientists
                    and technicians, indispensable though these experts are to the total process of
                    arriving at such decisions. Foreign policy positions are political in nature,
                    and have their place in the full scope of bilateral and multilateral
                    relations.</p>
                <p>A separate CIP Bureau was established under Ambassador Dougan. It lasted until
                    roughly the second year of the Clinton administration, when budgetary
                    constraints and lingering resentment caused the bureau to be abolished and its
                    functions merged again within the EB Bureau.</p>
                <p>C The CAPSTONE Seminar</p>
                <p>I next was offered an opportunity to attend the CAPSTONE seminar, two months of
                    training at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington for
                    newly promoted admirals and generals. The State Department sends one of its
                    senior FSOs to provide a foreign policy dimension to this flag-rank class of
                    approximately twenty-four.</p>
                <p>The Cold War was intense in 1984. My nearly four years in the Navy at the end of
                    the Korean War left me with a life-long bond to the military. Our seminar
                    consisted of outstanding officers, one of whom became the Army chief of staff.
                    During these months, I learned the significance of “purple,” the color you would
                    allegedly produce if you were to boil Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, and
                    Marine uniforms together in one great cauldron. Purple is a metaphor for the
                    need, strongly emphasized during CAPSTONE, for greater cohesion among the
                    services in order to build a more effective fighting force in joint operations.
                    Our seminar convened shortly after the Grenada invasion fiasco of 1983, during
                    which the absence of coordination among the services, especially in
                    communications, was so pronounced that at least one GI was forced to use a
                    public pay phone to call in air strikes.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>A second focus was on combined operations, those involving cooperation with
                    allied forces. Split into two groups, we visited every four-star command in the
                    world. My half went to the Pacific commands. We traveled throughout the United
                    States to visit major bases. The candor we encountered from senior officers was
                    astonishing to me: the general in charge of the Grenada invasion, for example,
                    was withering in his criticism of an operation for which he had been
                    responsible. Such blunt and unvarnished self-criticism is not heard in the State
                    Department. Our work was guided by retired four-star officers, who traveled with
                    us, attended our seminars as mentors, and shared their knowledge and experience.
                    I found this approach so effective that when I became director of the Foreign
                    Service Institute five years later, I established a mentoring program for the
                    A-100 course for newly appointed foreign service officers. We now invite an
                    active duty or retired ambassador to join each A-100 course as a resource for
                    its members.</p>
                <p>The CAPSTONE seminar renewed my admiration for the intelligence, character, and
                    commitment of our military, and gave me a needed opportunity to update my
                    understanding of strategic concerns and the enormous impact of technological
                    change. Driven by the Cold War, the readiness, competence and morale of our
                    armed services were reassuring. They had overcome the trauma of defeat in
                    Vietnam. There was an entirely new language of acronyms to learn. I was
                    astonished, too, by the equipment on bridges and in the command centers of the
                    ships we visited, which was highly computerized and entirely different from the
                    technology of my own years at sea. The large wooden helm on the bridge, with its
                    symbolism, reassurance and lore, was gone, replaced by something like the
                    steering wheel of an automobile.</p>
                <p>What struck me forcibly about CAPSTONE, which continues as mandatory training for
                    newly minted flag officers despite its cost, is the insistence of the military
                    services on providing expensive training to its personnel at all levels. In this
                    case, the focus was on leadership requirements in senior ranks. By comparison,
                    the State Department, AID, and USIA, despite the Foreign Service Institute, are
                    living in the Dark Ages.</p>
                <p>D The Operations Center and History of the Bureaus</p>
                <p>Charlie Hill, the executive secretary of the State Department and Jock Covey, his
                    deputy, all of us colleagues from Jerusalem days, asked me to give them some
                    help with the senior watch officer function in State's Operations Center. They
                    wanted me to review our crisis management procedures. I spent a month in the Op
                    Center, as everyone calls it. I joined a midnight shift, became acquainted with
                    the senior watch officers, and talked with bureaus and agencies like CIA and
                    Defense that depend on the Department's Operations Center, or have close working
                    relationships with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>The Operations Center never shuts down. Protected by security measures, it is
                    located on the Seventh Floor a few yards from the offices of State's most senior
                    officials. It is the first point of contact in any international crisis, and has
                    the most sophisticated communications capability at State. It is not unusual for
                    a secretary of state to appear there for the latest information on a crisis. I
                    came away with admiration for the work, around the clock, performed by the Op
                    Center staff, and developed recommendations to strengthen the watch officer
                    function.</p>
                <p>During this period, Ronald Spiers became under secretary for management, an old
                    friend going back to graduate school. It was just before I went to CAPSTONE that
                    Ron told me there were two posts for which I was being considered, Iceland and
                    Zaire. For the last three months of my tour in M/MO, I knew I would be selected
                    for Zaire, which was my preference in light of previous African experience and
                    my knowledge of French. But Iceland, a NATO country, had its own tug for me as
                    well. What would it have been like to live and work there?</p>
                <p>My final project stemmed from experiences in M/MO with the communications
                    function, and how it should be managed. I asked Bill De Pree whether anyone had
                    compiled a history of the State Department's bureaus. Since he did not know of
                    such an effort I went to see the Department's historian, Dr. William Slany, to
                    ask him whether he would be interested in doing this. I wanted to determine
                    when, and for what purposes, each bureau had been created. What were the needs
                    and pressures at a particular moment in history that a new bureau was intended
                    to address? The historian's office, in a few months, produced two volumes on the
                    origins of each bureau in the Department of State. They contained invaluable
                    information about how the State Department evolved into the organization it
                    became in 1984.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, my one-year of service in M/MO and participation in CAPSTONE were
                    productive and enjoyable, if also disruptive to family life and unexpected.</p>
                <p>17AMBASSADOR TO ZAIRE: 1984-87</p>
                <p>Being an ambassador is different from anything done before, whether as a foreign
                    service officer, journalist, or CEO of a major corporation. At an embassy, the
                    deputy chief of mission takes on the day-to-day management and the ambassador
                    provides leadership and policy direction. An ambassador's authorities and
                    responsibilities are better defined in the president's long letter of
                    instructions to each ambassador than those of any other person in foreign
                    affairs appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate; they are much
                    more explicitly stated than the functions of the secretary of state. Ambassadors
                    are supported by staffs who ordinarily are experienced and competent, and whose
                    success in their careers is linked to the ambassador's success. They are
                    provided places to live intended to represent our country and its values or, in
                    a capital like Paris, where our residence is more like a palace, America's
                    prestige and place in history.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>Despite the absorbing and stimulating activities of social and public diplomacy,
                    an ambassador, like the captain of a ship, must be at the center of things but
                    also maintain a certain distance, since he or she is ultimately accountable for
                    everything that takes place. So a kind of solitude comes with the privilege of
                    command responsibility. Making the hard decisions on how to further US interests
                    with the host government, how to deal with a crisis, is the ambassador's task,
                    someone who must at the same time take into account and move a huge, sluggish,
                    Byzantine bureaucracy in Washington that sets the agenda for relations.</p>
                <p>No American abroad should be able to define the elements of relations more
                    lucidly than the ambassador, understand local and Washington's concerns more
                    thoroughly, assess the future more astutely, or anticipate opportunities and
                    difficulties more shrewdly. It is work requiring constant thought. An ambassador
                    at post has left native shores behind and does not spend too long in either
                    harbor, maneuvering in the waters in between, entering one and then the other
                    port, only to leave again for the open seas that separate them and are his or
                    her dominion.</p>
                <p>Ronald Reagan telephoned prospective ambassadors at the time their nominations
                    were forwarded by the White House to the Senate. His ostensible purpose was the
                    formal one of asking whether they would accept their posting, something they had
                    known about for an average of six months, having gone through security,
                    financial disclosure and other bureaucratic processes along the way. I think
                    Reagan did this because he enjoyed personal contact and dispensing good news, as
                    well as exercising an agreeable side of presidential authority. He was making
                    the important point, however, that ambassadors were his personal representatives
                    abroad, deriving their constitutional authority from him. This was particularly
                    important for foreign service appointees, accustomed to layers of bureaucracy,
                    to understand.</p>
                <p>A White House operator reached me a day in advance, giving me a time frame during
                    which I could expect a call from the president. I got myself ready at the
                    appointed hour, and asked my 13-year old son, Mark, to pick up the telephone
                    extension when the call came through in order to hear the president. After
                    several false rings from unwelcome callers that morning, the White House
                    operator was finally on the line. “The president is calling,” she said. Mark
                    scrambled into place, his hand cupped over the speaking end of the extension
                    phone. What a special moment in a foreign service career and family life!</p>
                <p>A pause, and then the familiar, husky, friendly voice was on the line. “Mr.
                    Grover?” the president asked, adding an “r” to my name. I glanced at an
                    astonished Mark with an expression that said if you laugh I'll throttle you. To
                    his credit, Mark kept his hand on the phone, although he was starting to
                    tremble. This was dad's big moment! In the brief exchange that followed, I told
                    the president that in Zaire I would do my best for him and our country. “I know
                    you will,” was his gracious reply.</p>
                <p>A US Objectives</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>In 1984, as I picked up the threads of our relations, Zaire was a particularly
                    important country to us in Africa. By 1997, the year of President Mobutu's
                    expulsion by Laurent Kabila, it was far less so. Zaire, then the Belgian Congo,
                    gained its independence in 1961, along with many other countries in sub-Saharan
                    Africa. Over the next four chaotic years, the Congo went in a Marxist direction
                    under the influence of Patrice Lumumba, who was murdered, apparently by Mobutu's
                    supporters. Its various governments narrowly succeeded in suppressing bloody
                    secessionist movements in the mining region of Katanga and to the north in
                    Stanleyville, and its economy collapsed.</p>
                <p>When a former army sergeant, Joseph D�sir� Mobutu, seized power with the help of
                    the US government through its urbane, amiable and canny CIA station chief in
                    Leopoldville, Lawrence Devlin, Zaire's future was sealed. I once asked Larry, a
                    good friend, whether it is true that the CIA in Washington had sent him a tube
                    of poisoned toothpaste with instructions to get it to Lumumba. “It is,” he
                    replied with a smile, “but I didn't carry out the order. I questioned it. How in
                    the world would I get toothpaste to Lumumba, anyway?”</p>
                <p>By 1984, Zaire had been brought to ruin by Mobutu. One-third the size of the
                    United States, Zaire is as large as our country east of the Mississippi River.
                    It has strategically important natural resources, among them copper, cobalt,
                    diamonds, oil, timber, and copper related minerals, of which there are many.
                    When world commodity prices and especially copper prices fell precipitously in
                    1973, Zaire suffered an economic decline of major proportions from which it has
                    not recovered.</p>
                <p>The US was also interested in Zaire for strategic reasons. Mobutu had steadfastly
                    supported us in the Cold War; he had become one of our strongest allies in
                    Africa. He sided with us in the UN on important issues. He twice sent his troops
                    to restore order in Chad. He was viewed by us as the powerful and enduring
                    leader of a large country surrounded by nine smaller countries which he helped
                    keep in the Western orbit. In addition, Mobutu was an important voice in the
                    Angolan and Namibian struggles and in US-sponsored negotiations.</p>
                <p>I left Washington with three major objectives in our relations. First, we were
                    committed to keeping Zaire on the path of economic reform. At the time, there
                    was an impressive and increasing degree of compliance by Mobutu with
                    IMF-mandated economic restructuring, including meeting scheduled debt repayments
                    in the Paris Club, an oddly named organization that regulates
                    government-to-government debt. There was overall progress on the economic front,
                    albeit uneven, which gave slender hope that the basic downward spiral could be
                    slowed. The country had been plundered for decades by Mobutu and his cohorts. To
                    keep Zaire on the path of economic reform the US worked in tandem with Belgium
                    and France in particular, often urging the same actions on Mobutu and his
                    government to demonstrate our common views.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>The second US objective was to keep the dialogue with Mobutu going in our
                    direction. For anything significant to be accomplished in Zaire during my
                    tenure, we would require Mobutu's support. To succeed with Mobutu, I would need
                    to understand his personality and develop strategies to foster as cooperative a
                    relationship with him as possible. Despite US government tolerance of his
                    despotic ways and our generous aid programs, Mobutu was renowned for having
                    American ambassadors for breakfast. Three of my nine predecessors had formally
                    or informally been asked by Mobutu to leave.</p>
                <p>Our third policy objective was the most elusive. We sought real progress, in
                    specific ways and cases, in curbing wide-spread and well documented human rights
                    abuses. At the same time, we intended to nudge Mobutu toward democratic
                    practices, particulary with regard to tolerating opposition leaders and their
                    parties, and acknowledging a role for them in the political process.</p>
                <p>Before departing for Kinshasa, I talked with my predecessors: “How did you handle
                    Mobutu? What should I expect?” These conversations gave me, from different
                    angles, a picture of Mobutu that was all too accurate. He was a man of
                    constancy. Not surprisingly, my predecessors were foreign service officers
                    rather than political appointees, each with his own style and ways of dealing
                    with Mobutu. In the course of time I developed mine, which I will later
                    describe.</p>
                <p>I recognized that the situation in Zaire—the overwhelming poverty, near absence
                    of human rights, disintegrating infrastructure, one-man rule—would not change
                    significantly during my tenure, short of a miracle. The demise of Mobutu was not
                    expected. I saw that I could have only a minimal effect on Zaire's future.
                    Little glamor was attached to this ambassadorship.</p>
                <p>There was great fear of Mobutu in Zaire, and of his army in particular, by people
                    in villages and the countryside who suffered constantly from pillaging,
                    brutality and rape by his underpaid or unpaid soldiers, who exacted their “pay”
                    from villagers by stealing food and generally having their way. There was no one
                    in Zaire at that time able to challenge Mobutu directly. Opposition leaders like
                    Etienne Tshisekedi and members of his UDPS Party lived in exile in Belgium, as
                    did N'guz Karl-i-Bond. Our embassy in Brussels maintained low-level contacts
                    with these figures, arousing Mobutu's suspicions and anger. He had a
                    relationship with us over the years that can only be described as love-hate on
                    his part.</p>
                <p>Before leaving Washington, I decided to call on the Israeli ambassador to tell
                    him of my intention to work closely with his counterpart in Kinshasa. Israel had
                    for many years made serious and sustained efforts to win friends and influence
                    people in various African countries. Moshe Arens was away, but his deputy,
                    Benjamin Netanyahu, received me for forty-five minutes of probing conversation.
                    I sensed I was in the presence of a highly intelligent, smooth yet intense,
                    politically attuned and forceful man who had done his homework on Zaire. I could
                    not miss a steely and domineering quality in his personality.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>B Accreditation of an Ambassador</p>
                <p>Ambassadors newly arrived at their posts follow similar procedures leading to
                    accreditation to a head of government or chief of state. Copies of letters of
                    credence, and recall of the previous ambassador, signed by the president of the
                    United States, are delivered to the foreign minister. The ministry's chief of
                    protocol explains local diplomatic practices, such as when to fly flags on one's
                    official car, and briefs the ambassador-designate about the accreditation
                    ceremony. The new ambassador, meanwhile, has time to take charge of the embassy
                    and settle into a residence often in need of painting and serious repair,
                    sparsely furnished, and therefore dispiriting at first sight.</p>
                <p>My courtesy call on the foreign minister was uneventful. The chief of protocol
                    arranged to brief me on the evening before I was to present my credentials to
                    President Mobutu. During my call on him, Kinshasa experienced a total power
                    failure caused by a thunder storm. We were in complete darkness in an empty
                    building. There were no candles or flashlights at hand. The briefing continued.
                    At the end, moving in single file, we slid our fingers along the walls of
                    pitch-black inner corridors, calling to each other to stay in touch, and made
                    our way cautiously down several flights of stairs to my car outside. An apt
                    briefing in every way, I thought.</p>
                <p>On the following day, four other newly arrived ambassadors and I were scheduled
                    for individual appearances before Mobutu. We were to be ready at our residences
                    at nine o'clock, but did not know in what sequence we would be whisked to the
                    presidency by motor cycle escorts. The heavy rains of the previous night had
                    caused a major leak through the ceiling of my son Mark's bedroom, adding urgency
                    to the list of repairs to the second floor of the residence. Senior advisers on
                    the embassy's country team were invited to join me at the ceremony. We spent
                    three warm hours on my terrace becoming better acquainted, and drinking coffee
                    in our most formal attire while work crews attended to the flooding and roof.
                    Motor cycle escorts for other ambassadors living nearby wailed and roared as
                    they sped their charges to Mobutu, sounds disappointingly fading away as, once
                    again, they passed us by. Finally, the churning reached our gates which had long
                    stood open, and eight policemen vroomed into the circular drive at breakneck
                    speed, flinging up dust and gravel to the horror of our bulldog, Johnny. At long
                    last, I was on my way.</p>
                <p>C Mobutu Sese Seko</p>
                <p>I first saw President Mobutu at Camp Tshatshi, when I presented my credentials to
                    him during a ceremony on a plateau overlooking the Zaire River at Stanley Pool,
                    where millions of tons of water roiling and pounding on rock make a drumbeat of
                    their own. A newly arrived ambassador faces this rushing river while national
                    anthems are played, and it's quite a thrill.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>I looked to my right where Mobutu was waiting in the entrance to a large
                    paillote, or straw covered hut. He was a tall, heavy-set figure, standing
                    against the dark background of the interior and my first impression was the
                    gleaming whites of his eyes bordered by black horn-rimmed glasses. He was
                    wearing his abacost, the required Zairean dress for men modeled on the Mao
                    jacket, perhaps China's most distinctive contribution to the Zairean scene. His
                    head was large and round with tightly curled hair covered, outdoors, by his
                    trademark leopard skin hat. He carried the carved wooden stick of a chieftain
                    and stood ramrod straight. It was disconcerting to feel him standing there,
                    watching me intently as the band played.</p>
                <p>I walked toward him trailed by senior members of my staff, whom I introduced.
                    Another of Mobutu's affectations was to insist on being addressed as “Citizen
                    President.” I carried a letter from President Reagan, which I had helped write
                    and managed to get signed before my departure from Washington. It described our
                    objectives in the relationship and said some pleasant things about me. I
                    presented it to Mobutu and he was pleased.</p>
                <p>Mobutu, I had been told, had the habit of testing American ambassadors as soon as
                    he could, and lost no time with me. “Mr. Ambassador,” he said, “I want to offer
                    you a traditional Zairean drink—coconut milk. I hope this does not violate your
                    human rights,” a clumsy dig at best. Mobutu felt sensitive about our human
                    rights policies and pressures, and I was pleased to see they were having even
                    this kind of effect. I am not fond of coconut milk, but assuring Mobutu that my
                    human rights were unoffended, I did my duty for my country.</p>
                <p>I met with Mobutu many times, usually alone or with one or two others over
                    breakfast or lunch. He spoke no English and we communicated in French. He was
                    often moody and depressed or angry, and increasingly bored with his life. Mobutu
                    had everything money could buy: his yacht Kamaniola, residences in Zaire,
                    Switzerland, France and elsewhere, women of a certain kind. There were no
                    comforts he could not enjoy, if he wanted them. Yet he found these dull and
                    insufficient and, as it turned out, he was ignoring his health. He was building
                    a marble palace at Badolite, in the northwest corner of Zaire. My diplomatic
                    colleagues and I, who were summoned there from time to time, watched its
                    construction, and that of an airport and Potemkin village nearby, with awe and
                    dismay. Everything seemed to be made of green malachite and Italian marble.
                    Mobutu began to spend more and more time in the Oz world of Badolite. While he
                    thus indulged himself, the rest of Zaire rotted.</p>
                <p>Mobutu nevertheless felt a profound attachment to Zaire and its soil, the way
                    Russians feel about Mother Russia. I thought at the time the worst punishment
                    one could impose on him would be exile. He would despair in the knowledge that
                    he would never see his homeland again. Its loamy earth, smells, trees, crops,
                    rain, the game preserve at Virunga, its giant muddy river, all had a strong grip
                    on him. Mobutu had been in power eighteen years when I arrived. He pined for
                    Zaire every time he left, even when he was enjoying the comforts of Europe, and
                    could hardly wait to get home again.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>In private, Mobutu was a shy and unassertive man. I have seen this trait in other
                    leaders whose public display of charisma, self-confidence and authority is
                    forceful. He was a generous and caring host. If you were his guest at a small
                    and social meal, he would insist on serving you himself from the buffet of
                    African dishes, telling each guest what was on his plate, not helping himself
                    until all his guests, or at least the guest of honor, had been served. I was in
                    constant dread of encountering monkey meat. Although I have eaten many exotic
                    animals, I draw the line when it comes to monkey. It's a little too close to
                    home.</p>
                <p>Mobutu could be relaxed at intimate social occasions and participate in banter
                    and small talk. He would wear a Hawaiian type of sport shirt with an open
                    collar, often in wild colors. These were times he called me “tu,” and we joshed
                    without regard to roles. He liked to tease and put down his target of the
                    moment; his humor was usually at someone else's expense. I was the butt
                    occasionally, and never found myself on his wavelength at such times. More than
                    once, for example, Mobutu played me off against his wife and her identical twin
                    sister. One of them would enter the room while we were talking, and Mobutu would
                    courteously ask me, “Have you met my wife?” I answered that I had, at which
                    point he would say with childish delight, “Well, that's not my wife!”</p>
                <p>Politically astute, Mobutu was a discerning and informed observer of world
                    politics. Long in office, he had a deep appreciation of the regions of Africa
                    and their leaders, among whom he favored Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast,
                    Bongo of Gabon, and his old ally, King Hassan II of Morocco who would ultimately
                    provide him refuge when he was overthrown. Beyond Africa, he arrived at
                    sophisticated assessments of the Soviets, Chinese and ourselves, asking me
                    pointed and well informed questions. He admired the Chinese, and had little use
                    for the Soviets in any form. He liked to talk politics and was a Reagan fan. He
                    understood competing interests in the Cold War as they played themselves out in
                    Africa. For him this was vital. Mobutu managed his relationship with the United
                    States through the Cold War decades, during which our involvement in Zaire was
                    deep, in calculated ways that aligned him solidly with the West. While he read
                    our leaders since Kennedy well, he never understood (or did not want to
                    understand) our system of government, believing a president need only instruct
                    Congress on levels of foreign and military aid. For his support, regionally and
                    in forums like the UN, we backed and rewarded Mobutu.</p>
                <p>Mobutu characteristically viewed politics in terms of people, assessing their
                    strengths, weaknesses, ambitions, appeal, and foibles. “That fellow!” he would
                    exclaim when I asked about someone, following this rejoinder with a canny and
                    usually unflattering thumbnail sketch. Until his last few years in power, Mobutu
                    met with many leaders on a regular basis to keep his knowledge and influence
                    current. He nourished his African connections in ways one can only guess at, and
                    constantly tried to play off the Belgians, French and ourselves against each
                    other in his own game of triangulation. During my time, at least, it didn't
                    work.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>Proud, vain and thin-skinned, Mobutu was obsessively concerned about imagined
                    slights to his presidency. If one understood this sensitivity, and made clear
                    one was talking about issues and not demeaning the dignity of his office, Mobutu
                    would usually listen carefully, and the dialogue could deal with some of the
                    most contentious aspects of US-Zairean relations. We would quite often, for
                    example, be able to discuss such topics as transparency in financial
                    transactions, human rights, and political reforms.</p>
                <p>In the end, I was instrumental in causing several political prisoners to be
                    freed. Mobutu created a government office for human rights during my tour,
                    making a big point of it with me when it was opened. Occasionally, I would call
                    on the head of that office, Citizen Nimi, who was one of Mobutu's henchmen. I
                    did not get the impression that this citizen felt passionately about the rights
                    of his fellow citizens. I attempted to make progress on issues of economic and
                    political reforms by appealing to Mobutu's sense of history. I asked him how he
                    thought history would judge him if he did not take steps toward reform,
                    suggesting that such measures, were he to apply them, would be applauded. “Think
                    of your place in history!” I implored him, with scant expectation that I could
                    persuade him to act in accord with our policy objectives and his own best
                    interests.</p>
                <p>In fact, Mobutu cared little for the people of Zaire. He was never interested in
                    discussing our economic aid programs with me. Military assistance was a
                    different matter. Despite his skill at raising money, Mobutu did almost nothing
                    to provide schools and functioning hospitals, roads, water, sanitation,
                    electricity, housing, or anything else for the ordinary Zaireans, who created an
                    extended-family economic system to stay alive. He enjoyed his power over them,
                    and their organized support at staged mass rallies. Democratic institutions and
                    respect for human rights had no place in his schemes. Mobutu felt himself
                    accountable to no one.</p>
                <p>Special Ambassador Vernon (Dick) Walters visited Kinshasa as a presidential envoy
                    on two or three occasions while I was there. He had not yet been appointed our
                    representative to the United Nations. He came to underscore our views on the
                    urgency of Paris Club public sector debt repayments and structural economic
                    reforms, and, in the usual mix we fed Mobutu, to talk about support for UNITA
                    and the rebel leader Savimbi in Angola. Walters was tapped to make these
                    overtures because he had great influence over Mobutu. Dick stayed with me at the
                    residence, and this great raconteur was always a prized guest, especially in my
                    children's eyes. I well remember the first time I went with Walters to see
                    Mobutu. He was on board the presidential yacht, on which we landed in a
                    helicopter while it was underway, to Walters' evident discomfort. Throughout the
                    conversation, Walters flattered Mobutu in ways so exaggerated I thought they
                    would cause us problems. Nobody could be that gullible, I reasoned. On the way
                    back in the car, I commented to Dick that I thought he may have overdone it.
                    Walters looked at me disparagingly and said: “Brandon, anyone who thinks
                    flattery doesn't work has never had any!” He read Mobutu correctly from the day
                    he met him years earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>Dick is the only person I know who can accurately recite Mobutu's full name:
                    Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga. Translated, it means “All-conquering
                    warrior who goes from conquest to conquest,” in the polite version, or, more
                    accurately, “The cock who jumps on anything that moves.” Nothing “moved” in
                    Zaire that was not pleasing or profitable to its president.</p>
                <p>D Mobutu with Bush and Reagan</p>
                <p>During a visit to Washington in 1986, on which I accompanied him, Mobutu was
                    invited to a White House breakfast with Vice President Bush. There were perhaps
                    eight of us around a table in the vice president's office. Mobutu sat at Bush's
                    right, and I at Mobutu's right. When a steward entered with a platter of
                    scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon, he went directly to Bush who served himself
                    generously, and then proceeded to Mobutu. As Mobutu helped himself, Bush began
                    to eat. The Zaireans noticed. I felt Mobutu stiffen. Bush, normally a man of
                    instinctive courtesy, had unintentionally offended his visitors and run afoul of
                    etiquette dictating the relationship between host and guest. The host,
                    solicitous of others, is the last to be served and eat. Although Mobutu made no
                    subsequent comment to me, he felt slighted and surely found his host wanting on
                    this occasion.</p>
                <p>Returning, during the visit, in an Air Zaire jet with Mobutu and his entourage
                    from a brief sojourn in New York, I found myself sitting across the aisle and
                    slightly behind Mme. Mobutu. I looked up from my book when she summoned an aide,
                    who brought her a suitcase which she asked him to unlock. Inside, arranged side
                    by side, I could see rows of fresh US currency, bound together with paper bands
                    across the middle. It was a scene from a gangster movie. I could not read the
                    denomination of the bills, but a safe guess is that they were 100s. And this is
                    after the shopping spree on Fifth Avenue!</p>
                <p>Before departing, Mobutu joined President Reagan for a “working lunch.” This was
                    preceded by a meeting in the Oval Office, during which a few points of substance
                    were addressed by the president, and reinforced by George Shultz and Caspar
                    Weinberger. Our thrust was to encourage Mobutu to adhere to IMF and World Bank
                    reforms, which were stringent, in order to get Zaire's economy on track.
                    Everyone then adjourned to a small luncheon in the Roosevelt Room. Here, a
                    relaxed American president abandoned all thought of serious conversation. He
                    began telling jokes, many of which had communism or the Soviet Union as their
                    target. These were dutifully translated into French by one of the State
                    Department's star interpreters (those unsung heroes!) Alec Toumayan. I have
                    never heard a joke travel well in translation, and these were no exception.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>Mobutu became increasingly baffled. The Americans chuckled loyally, although it
                    was clear that for White House staffers like James Baker, and regulars at the
                    table like Shultz and Weinberger, this was not the first time around. Mobutu
                    tried to discuss Angola and the Benguela Railway. Finally, he gave in and told a
                    rather long story himself, in French. It fell flat, although everyone tried
                    their best. In the State Department later on, I asked Alec whether Reagan always
                    told so many jokes. “No,” Alec replied, “sometimes he tells more.”</p>
                <p>Reagan may be among our underestimated presidents. True, he struck me as shrewd
                    and opinionated, locked in on only a few large objectives that were important to
                    him and impatient with details, but he was also immensely friendly and brimming
                    with good humor. From his conversation, I sensed his head was filled by a world
                    of horses, ranches and California sun that was dear to him. One occasionally
                    felt that for him the duties of the presidency were an unwelcome distraction,
                    noblesse oblige, accepted with a small sigh of resignation. But then all I
                    brought to him were the miseries of Palestinians on the West Bank and Mobutu
                    Sese Seko.</p>
                <p>Reagan was earthy, and sometimes told racial jokes after carefully checking out
                    the room. He assessed everyone in a room. He made eye contact, smiled and
                    nodded, and during briefings asked quiet people whether they wanted to add to
                    the discussion. I found it impossible not to like and respect him despite his
                    flaws and superficialities, and to be warmed and jollied by his presence.
                    Somehow, he was emblematic of our sunny and optimistic side.</p>
                <p>E The American Embassy</p>
                <p>Our embassy in Kinshasa was the second largest in Africa, after Cairo. We had a
                    major AID presence, some 250 volunteers in the Peace Corps, and a military
                    assistance mission. Economic aid to Zaire under Reagan rose to $80 million
                    annually, four times the amount during the Carter administration. There was an
                    effective USIS unit which had its greatest impact, I thought, in its library and
                    English teaching programs. We did not have commercial or agricultural
                    attach�s.</p>
                <p>Of particular importance in understanding the economic and political complexion
                    of Zaire was our consulate general in Lubumbashi, the former Elisabethville in
                    the southeast Katanga region of the Belgian Congo. Shaba, as the province is now
                    called, has a history of secessionist tendencies. It contains much of the
                    country's wealth, including its vast copper resources, and is the economic
                    engine of Zaire. Its leaders are sophisticated, business oriented people who
                    have a way of looking down their noses at the rest of the country, particularly
                    at the governing center of Kinshasa. The Clinton administration, citing budget
                    constraints, closed our Lubumbashi post. Penny wise, possibly, but surely pound
                    foolish. I enjoyed visiting Lubumbashi and its surroundings, which were cooler,
                    higher, more graceful and less grating than Kinshasa. Homes built in the western
                    style had fireplaces to keep them warm.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>The deputy chief of mission for most of my stay was Daniel L. Simpson, who had
                    earlier in his career been consul general in Lubumbashi. He was an expert on the
                    African continent, a first-rate manager, courageous foreign service officer, and
                    greatly valued adviser, a friend who would later succeed me in Kinshasa, and
                    preside over US interests during the invasion of Zaire and overthrow of a
                    terminally ill Mobutu by Kabila. Then and thereafter, he sorely missed the
                    presence of a US consulate in Lubumbashi.</p>
                <p>Peace Corps volunteers were engaged in such projects as fish and chicken farms,
                    water wells, public health, and road maintenance. These efforts, although at low
                    technical levels, were on target. The Peace Corps served Zaire particularly
                    well, and we were all pleased by its performance. The mesh of Peace Corps and
                    AID projects, a result of daily coordination of efforts, was in Washington's
                    view a model to emulate. AID was involved in larger endeavors, some of which I
                    thought were ill-conceived. Rural electrification, being pushed by AID, was an
                    example of economic development too advanced for the existing state of Zaire's
                    economy and its absorptive capacity. Some of these assistance projects stemmed
                    from what AID's Washington bureaucracy thought should be done, rather than what
                    the Zaireans thought should be done, and I often agreed with the Zaireans.</p>
                <p>There were, of course, many AID projects that were well conceived and successful.
                    I was able to reshape the economic assistance program during my three years, but
                    it wasn't easy. Soon after my arrival I initiated three seminars on development
                    in which the full country team of senior advisers participated. The AID mission,
                    Dan Simpson, and I selected key development issues, and our discussions produced
                    priorities and options for program development. These seminars were tied to
                    AID's annual budget and planning process. My initiative was not popular in the
                    AID mission. The senior leadership felt I was being intrusive; some thought I
                    was overstepping the bounds of propriety. As ambassador, however, I wanted a
                    firm voice in the nature and direction of all major programs in Zaire, and was
                    particularly interested in how increasingly scarce US resources were being used.
                    We met on three Saturdays for about three hours during each seminar. Papers were
                    presented and discussed. As a consequence of these seminars, we changed some
                    existing programs and the longer term direction of our development assistance.
                    Priorities were reordered. The AID mission afterwards could cite its ambassador
                    as a staunch supporter, and that should have been useful to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>On the military assistance side, the French, Israelis, Egyptians, Chinese,
                    Canadians, Germans and Belgians had programs as well. The Israelis trained
                    Mobutu's personal security detachment and made it a crack outfit. Mobutu himself
                    had received training in Tel Aviv as a paratrooper. Our objectives were to
                    assist Zairean forces in logistical matters, communications, transportation, and
                    training. We provided Jeeps, trucks, other vehicles, communications gear, and a
                    modest list of non-lethal equipment. We were careful not to supply weapons,
                    ammunition, or training for potential police functions. Occasionally, we sent
                    Zairean officers to the United States under the International Military Exchange
                    and Training (IMET) program, one of the most effective concepts in US military
                    assistance. An officer who visits the United States returns with a better
                    appreciation of democracy, American style, as well as life in an open and
                    transparent market economy.</p>
                <p>The embassy's political officers thought of Zaire's governing process as a
                    bewildering merry-go-round. People would be in power as cabinet officers or
                    advisers to the president, and six to twelve months later they would be ousted,
                    to be replaced by people who had been thrown out earlier. The process would be
                    repeated, with former outs becoming new ins. Changes were made according to
                    Mobutu's whims, and were intended to prevent ministers from creating their own
                    platforms of power. They also served as a reminder of who was in charge.</p>
                <p>The exception to this merry-go-round was a small coterie of trusted personal
                    advisers, one or two of whom, I suspect, managed the president's finances and
                    knew the account numbers in Switzerland. His team was a kakistocracy, a
                    descriptive Greek word meaning government of a state by its worst citizens.
                    Mobutu was a hands-on president at every turn, and a paid network of spies kept
                    him informed. His power stemmed from absolute control of the military, generous
                    payoffs to all and sundry, and micromanaging Zaire.</p>
                <p>Mobutu was also paranoid about the American embassy, suspecting us of plotting
                    against him. He thought members of our political section were reaching out to
                    opposition figures at a time when there was no political opposition worthy of
                    the name. He was wildly suspicious of the Peace Corps. Toward the end of my
                    stay, he ordered all volunteers expelled for allegedly stirring up dissent in
                    the countryside. One volunteer in the Kivu region had made disparaging remarks
                    about Mobutu over beers in a bar. My explanation to Mobutu of this trivial
                    incident fell on deaf ears.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>Zaire was special to my children, who had not seen Africa. My youngest son Mark
                    attended TASOK, the American school of Kinshasa, for three years. During one of
                    his holidays, we took a memorable trip to the vast Virunga Game Park, where
                    there is no tourism, and to the pygmy country in the rain forest beyond. Jack,
                    Cathy and Paul came from their colleges for the summers. Jack worked in the
                    embassy's general services section, honing his skills as a carpenter and
                    enjoying the swimming pool. Cathy filled in for the Community Liaison Officer
                    while the latter was on leave, and led her own embassy trip to Virunga. She
                    stood beside me, a single parent, in the receiving line at our 4th of July
                    reception, wearing a lovely white suit with blue trim and a big white hat, a
                    very stylish 22-year old and in every way a gracious representative of our
                    country.</p>
                <p>Paul, characteristically, persuaded our big-hearted Defense Attach�, Colonel Paul
                    Wenzel, to arrange for him to join the French-sponsored paratrooper training
                    program for Zairean soldiers, made three perfect jumps which I watched on three
                    harrowing days, and won his wings. These youngsters were intrigued by African
                    life and culture, and admired the Africans they came to know in open, easy ways.
                    Foreign Service life can be a gift to one's children.</p>
                <p>F The AIDS Virus</p>
                <p>Along with France, we participated in a small but important AIDS research effort
                    centered in Kinshasa. The US side was headed by Dr. Paul Mann, of the National
                    Institutes of Health, later to become UN director in Geneva of the global effort
                    to understand and combat AIDS. By 1983, it had become evident that the disease
                    was of epidemic proportions, especially on the African continent. Some
                    speculated AIDS may have started in Zaire among green rhesus monkeys; others
                    attributed its origins to Haiti. It was in Kinshasa that scientists learned the
                    AIDS virus could be transmitted in both directions between the sexes, and from
                    mother to child.</p>
                <p>A large, uninformed American community in Zaire, comprising Peace Corps
                    volunteers in the countryside, teenagers and our Marines among others, was
                    exposed to this disease. I decided we needed a “town meeting” to air the matter,
                    and presided over a large gathering of Americans, including those from our
                    school and others outside of government, during which Dr. Mann and our two
                    embassy physicians described AIDS as a disease, with special emphasis on how to
                    avoid exposure. There were questions from a shocked audience, but in that one
                    session we defused what might have become a reaction of panic had we allowed
                    rumor and misinformation about this new and deadly virus to build up. We became
                    the first American embassy to recognize AIDS as a public health issue. Our
                    approach was described in State Magazine, the Department's house organ, as an
                    example of successful crisis management within an American overseas community.
                    This publicity had no discernable effect on the willingness of people from all
                    agencies to serve in Zaire.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>The Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus first erupted in Ebola, Zaire in 1976, causing
                    nearly 300 deaths. I had never heard it mentioned, although it was identified
                    well before AIDS which was first diagnosed in 1981. The Ebola virus emerged
                    again in 1989, threatening laboratory workers and custodians at a monkey house
                    in Reston, Virginia, which imported monkeys for research. No one was infected. A
                    vaccine is now said to be in the last stages of development.</p>
                <p>G Soviet and Chinese Diplomats in Africa</p>
                <p>One of the most active aid donors in Zaire was the People's Republic of China. We
                    discussed development assistance with the Chinese quite frequently, and noticed
                    that they usually chose worthwhile, low-profile projects and made them succeed.
                    Chinese technicians kept to themselves in the countryside, living together in
                    cramped, hot quarters and socializing only with each other. There seemed to be
                    little, if any, outreach on their part to the local population, except to
                    provide technical training. There was a noticeable coolness between the Chinese
                    and Soviets in Zaire in the mid-1980s, particularly in an environment in which
                    Mobutu favored the former and shunned the latter.</p>
                <p>Our relationship with the Chinese was cordial. Their ambassador lived two houses
                    down the avenue from me alongside the river, and we called on each other from
                    time to time. I thought it worthwhile to explain to him what we were doing in
                    Zaire, and he reciprocated. Mobutu genuinely liked the Chinese. Some years
                    before I arrived, on returning from a visit to China, he had Zairean men dress
                    in Mao jackets, a compulsory and confining uniform that kept them hot and
                    irritated. The Chinese built him an enormous People's Palace in Kinshasa, where
                    he was able to hold lavish and wasteful social affairs.</p>
                <p>At several occasions I found myself seated next to the Chinese ambassador's
                    vivacious wife, who spoke neither German, French nor English. We discovered in a
                    process of elimination that she knew a little Spanish, as did I. We spent our
                    evenings together exploring wide-ranging topics in broken Spanish, our hands
                    filling in the words we did not know. She once told me with great animation that
                    a nine-foot boa had slithered into her garden and swallowed the cat. These were
                    long evenings.</p>
                <p>I rarely saw the Soviet ambassador, who spoke quite good English. He once came to
                    our residence for lunch with other ambassadors. The Cold War, of course, grimly
                    marched on. The USSR provided little development assistance to Zaire, and no
                    military assistance. Mobutu barely tolerated their embassy and its ambassador.
                    The Soviet presence was passive, although it may have had links to Cuban
                    military forces in neighboring Angola. This Soviet ambassador was visibly
                    unhappy with his assignment: he drank more than he should, and became known for
                    a loose tongue and disparaging remarks about Africans. He took a liking to me. I
                    did not object to becoming better acquainted, ever curious to learn more about
                    what my Soviet counterpart was doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>Early one evening, the ambassador called me at my office and asked whether he
                    could see me. I invited him to the residence for a drink. There we were, the two
                    of us, drinking vodka while his driver waited outside. My Soviet colleague
                    didn't seem to have an agenda. I listened carefully for the message I was
                    certain he had come to deliver. None came through, although he talked for quite
                    a while in a rambling way. I had finished reading a book by Arkady Shevchenko,
                    the ranking Soviet diplomat at the UN who defected, and had it upstairs. I asked
                    the ambassador, in a moment of mischief, whether he would be interested in
                    reading it. He said, oh yes. I began to wonder whether he was leading up to a
                    request for asylum and mentally reviewed what I would do under those
                    circumstances. After another drink, he left with the book, and without my being
                    able to determine why he had asked to see me. Thinking about it afterwards, I
                    could only guess that some combination of loneliness, despair, alcoholism, and
                    curiosity about Americans drove him to take such a dangerous step as seeing me
                    alone. If he harbored thoughts of changing sides, he never mentioned them.</p>
                <p>I did not give the episode further thought, beyond reporting it in intelligence
                    channels. Several months later, however, after this Soviet ambassador had left
                    Kinshasa, I read an arresting item in one of our periodic world-wide
                    intelligence summaries. It cited a Soviet foreign ministry report about one of
                    its ambassadors in an unnamed African country who had become recklessly friendly
                    with his American counterpart, and had accepted from him a book by the defector
                    Shevchenko. The report condemned loose and unprofessional behavior. The American
                    ambassador was subversive. Soviet diplomats everywhere must keep their guard up.
                    I found it amusing and a little sad. I suspect his “driver,” probably KGB,
                    turned him in, and assume my Russian colleague was punished for that bizarre and
                    pointless evening with me in Kinshasa.</p>
                <p>H Mariana</p>
                <p>During Mobutu's visit to Washington in December 1986 I met my future wife,
                    Mariana Moran Fleming, one of the few good things for which I credit him. I had
                    been a single parent, with custody of my minor sons Paul and Mark, ever since
                    Mary and I separated in 1980. They lived with me from the beginning of my
                    assignment to Jerusalem that year until college. Cathy and Jack, ending their
                    high school studies in Washington, spent summers with me while Mark and Paul
                    visited their mother in Spring Valley. It was a lonely time for all of us,
                    though friends helped us endure it. I felt the responsibilities of helping four
                    children through their most difficult growing years; the end of our marriage
                    surely was hardest on them. I managed the residences and official entertainment
                    in Jerusalem and Kinshasa, and accepted the life of a diplomat without a spouse.
                    Far from my thoughts at the end of a grinding, week-long visit to Washington by
                    Mobutu was the prospect of meeting someone so compatible, interested in the
                    world, lovely, and captivating as Mariana.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>On a cold December evening, out of a sense of duty, I accompanied Mobutu to the
                    Georgetown home at 28th and Q Streets of his friends Harry and Norma Smith. I
                    had met Harry, a businessman long involved in Africa, on his visits to Kinshasa.
                    Standing by the stair rail was Mariana, looking quite lost in a sea of Zaireans
                    in black Mao-jackets. She lived across the street, and had been invited by a
                    scheming Norma to meet the unattached American ambassador to Zaire. I asked her
                    right off whether she liked to travel, and she said she had done a lot of that.
                    The next evening we had dinner by the fire at La Chaumi�re. We would in any case
                    have met two nights later at a black tie dinner dance in the home of Smith and
                    Elizabeth Bagley, to which we had separately been invited. In encouraging her to
                    accept, Elizabeth told Mariana she could offer two Jesuit priests and our
                    ambassador to Zaire as single men. Mariana came anyway.</p>
                <p>Born of a Panamanian mother in the Alfaro family and an American father of Irish
                    descent, Mariana graduated from Smith College after majoring in art history and
                    Spanish. She was a founding partner of a Washington antiques business
                    specializing in 17th and 18th century English furniture. It thrived during the
                    free-spending 1980s and then closed its doors. Mariana became a Washington real
                    estate agent at a large firm. She was getting a divorce. Her daughter Michele,
                    also a Smith graduate, was starting off in New York's fashion industry when I
                    met her, working in retailing for stores like Ann Taylor and J. Crew,
                    specializing in women's wear. Petite, bright, quick to laugh and successful,
                    Michele became an instant New Yorker, living in Chelsea and eventually marrying
                    David Shotts, an environmental engineer and marathon runner of some distinction.
                    Mariana's son, Carlos, died in a drowning accident in the Philippines at the age
                    of 24.</p>
                <p>I invited Mariana to visit me in Zaire, after we had seen each other during
                    several of my subsequent trips to Washington. Over lunch before returning to
                    Kinshasa, I offered her malaria suppressant pills to take in advance of a
                    possible visit, which she accepted and I took as a good omen. She came in time
                    for the June 1987 festivities of “Fish Day.” In the Virunga Game Preserve, on a
                    rise overlooking an enormous, wild, and primordial plain with no trace of
                    civilization, believed to be a site of the earliest origins of man and woman, I
                    asked Mariana to marry me. Two bewildered, armed Zairean guards watched us at a
                    distance. We were married in Washington on December 3, 1988 with my son Mark as
                    an eloquent best man.</p>
                <p>I “Fish Day”</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>An annual festival in Kinkole, a tiny fishing village near Kinshasa, was called
                    “Fish Day” and provided Mobutu an opportunity to make a “State of the Nation”
                    address in front of an enormous crowd and hundreds of drummers and dancers.
                    Mobutu used the catching and marketing of fish as allegories for life in Zaire,
                    and dwelt on the symbolism of the great river as provider and life force. His
                    speech, entirely in Lingala, went on for more than two hours, with some sixty
                    ambassadors and their wives sitting in obligatory attendance under the sun in a
                    great variety of head cover. The Japanese had knotted a handkerchief in four
                    corners; a colleague unabashedly sported a hat from Disneyland with a Donald
                    Duck logo. Ambassadors who had been to Kinkole before brought books to read.
                    People slept. Not a single diplomat, including other Africans, understood
                    Lingala. My fianc�e Mariana was there, under a large straw hat.</p>
                <p>At the end of “Fish Day,” it was announced on the public address system by the
                    chief of protocol that luncheon would be offered to diplomats and their wives.
                    We were told where to gather, and went to the air cooled comfort of our
                    automobiles, forming a caravan to proceed to our destination. On disembarking at
                    a large and completely empty hall, we were in due course told by a flustered
                    protocol official that lunch would be provided at a different place. We all
                    climbed back into our official cars—each with its national flag—that had been
                    carelessly parked in conflicting directions on the narrow road. After
                    painstakingly forming a line again, we proceeded through billowing dust to
                    another place several miles away. When we arrived at this second destination, a
                    grand Chinese-style pavilion with gushing fountains at one of Mobutu's military
                    camps outside Kinshasa, we were relieved to find a splendid lunch beautifully
                    set out. It included vintage French wines and melting cheeses, and a barbecue of
                    local fish and beef from Belgium prepared by an Argentinian chef. Voluptuous
                    dancers wearing not very much swayed to live Hawaiian music.</p>
                <p>Mobutu somehow knew Mariana would be attending “Fish Day,” and we were astonished
                    to find ourselves at his small table. Mariana was on his right and I next to
                    her. Her place card read “Madame Brandon.” Fresh from Washington, she felt
                    herself in an altogether different world. During the meal, I inadvertently
                    caught the eye of the French ambassador at a distant table. He outranked me on
                    the protocol ladder, and found this breach of etiquette disconcerting as did
                    several of my other colleagues and their wives. Yet this was our life on
                    Mobutu's merry-go-round, this time during “Fish Day” at a Chinese pavilion on a
                    military base offering Argentine barbecue, French wine and cheeses, and Hawaiian
                    music under a blazing African sun.</p>
                <p>President Mobutu died of prostate cancer, in exile in Morocco on September 7,
                    1997.</p>
                <p>18MANAGEMENT REFORMS: 1987-88</p>
                <p>A An $84 Million Budgetary Shortfall</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>The day after I returned to Kinshasa from Washington, where I had been on
                    consultation at the State Department, I received a phone call from Ronald
                    Spiers, under secretary for management. He asked whether I could come back
                    permanently to head up a management reform team reporting to the deputy
                    secretary, which would address an unexpected budgetary shortfall. I asked when.
                    In a week's time, he replied. So I scrambled to pack, make farewell calls and do
                    the things one has to do when leaving a post. During my farewell call on the
                    dean of the diplomatic corps, he gave me an engraved silver tray, as was the
                    custom in Kinshasa for departing chiefs of mission; half an hour later, I handed
                    it to the packers. I bid adieu to President Mobutu at one of his mansions, this
                    one near Lausanne, on my way back to Washington, and told him my sudden
                    departure had no implications for US-Zairean relations. He seemed baffled by the
                    notion of a budgetary shortfall, and did not decorate me with the Order of the
                    Leopard, which was customarily given to departing ambassadors.</p>
                <p>A week later, on a warm Monday morning in September, 1987 I walked into Ron
                    Spiers' seventh floor office, ready to go to work with him and Deputy Secretary
                    of State John C. Whitehead. The crisis we were to address was a reduction by
                    congress of $84 million in the State Department's 1988 operating budget,
                    amounting to an unprecedented 6% cut in the Department's request for salaries
                    and expenses. A Steering Group headed by the deputy secretary had been
                    established to oversee the budget reduction process. On that committee were
                    Michael Armacost, under secretary for political affairs; Ron Spiers from
                    management; Melvin Levitsky, the executive secretary, and the comptroller, Roger
                    Feldman. I was to head up a working group reporting to this committee.</p>
                <p>I met with Secretary of State George Shultz, who underscored his personal
                    interest. He supported sensible belt-tightening, but established three ground
                    rules: the effort would concentrate exclusively on Washington operations; the
                    hiring of junior Foreign Service officers would not be reduced; and the Foreign
                    Service Institute's training budget would remain untouched, or “fenced” as he
                    put it.</p>
                <p>I have come to appreciate the wisdom of these ground rules as the Department goes
                    through a series of budget reductions after the Cold War. Today, when the cuts
                    are greater, Shultz' views make even better sense. He was a staunch supporter of
                    the Foreign Service as an institution and of all aspects of training. He
                    believed our posts abroad were as lean in staffing and funding as they could be.
                    Such focus is sadly lacking in today's nearly indiscriminate and irresponsible
                    budget slashing.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>I assembled a small working group to function on a full-time basis, selecting
                    civil service and foreign service people who were creative and successful
                    managers. Kerry Wiener, a young foreign service officer versed in management
                    theory and practice, had been working for George Vest, the director general, and
                    became my chief of staff and alter ego. “We're giving you our best,” George told
                    me. Kerry wrote much of our final report and made major contributions throughout
                    the process. We were to break new ground and encounter heavy resistance, and
                    quickly became a close team.</p>
                <p>I then secured choice office space on the ground floor opposite the Loy Henderson
                    conference room. Where you sit is important in State Department politics; if you
                    are to head a special activity, office location is a matter to resolve at the
                    outset while the glow of Seventh Floor support is apparent. The other immediate
                    need is to find experienced, imaginative, and unfailingly courteous secretarial
                    support—not for a week at a time, but for the duration of the project and
                    through the chaos of producing a final report. Lorrie Bider, perhaps the
                    Department's most independent minded secretary, who had long worked with Phil
                    Habib, ably met this need.</p>
                <p>The Steering Group had given its approval in principle to 80-odd recommendations
                    developed by the comptroller, Roger Feldman, and I was asked to flesh them out
                    and devise procedures to implement them. We found most of these to be flawed and
                    made in haste. Some would have had drastic consequences if approved, such as
                    removing all economic functions from the geographic bureaus and consolidating
                    them in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. The Steering Group's
                    awareness of the impact of these two-line proposals was slight, and they looked
                    to me to develop them in depth. Our delicate and difficult task, we saw with
                    dismay, would be to back the Steering Group away from the most egregious of
                    these. Feldman, whose only goal was to cut costs, had little concern about
                    effects on the State Department's substantive work. He was stridently defensive
                    about his proposals and knew far more than I about budgets, something he was
                    easily able to point out. My group's initial reports to Whitehead were negative
                    on most of the recommendations and had no numbers to offer in the savings
                    column. We created what we dubbed “Red Books,” plastic, red three-ring notebooks
                    in which we assembled the 80 proposals and our analyses of each. The tensions
                    with Feldman would persist.</p>
                <p>My weekly appearances before the Steering Group were solo events. There was much
                    to learn quickly as my team and I wrote papers citing pros, cons, and savings,
                    and then offered our usually negative recommendations. We worked long hours and
                    with a sense of mission. Kerry brought his framed poster of the musical “Les
                    Miserables” to the office and we displayed it in a place of honor. We started
                    with the worst proposals, to more easily change the Group's direction, and began
                    to win support. In the end, not many Red Book items survived. If we were to
                    abandon Feldman's approach, however, where would we find savings? We decided to
                    launch a broader review of how the State Department is managed.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>We formed the executive directors of bureaus and offices into a “committee of the
                    whole.” Kerry Wiener set up regular meetings with this group so we could draw on
                    their experience, ask them for ideas, and keep them informed of progress. We
                    were conscious of morale problems engendered by the Red Book proposals: rumors
                    were circulating widely of a reduction in workforce; elimination of a 10% pay
                    differential at hardship posts overseas; elimination of Sunday pay overseas;
                    closing 13 consulates; and abolishing needed offices in the Department. One of
                    my early efforts to calm the waters was to call on each assistant secretary to
                    brief him or her on how we would proceed. I asked for their cooperation and
                    promised we would keep them informed as my staff and I got to work on the Red
                    Book. This helped calm things down.</p>
                <p>At one Steering Group meeting, I discussed with Whitehead three areas I believed
                    needed special attention: the notoriously excessive number of deputy assistant
                    secretaries; the economic function, which had expanded without much thought or
                    discipline; and, most important, the administrative functions of budget,
                    personnel, general services, and management. We exempted security and
                    communications as areas too vast to cover in the time we had. I was especially
                    interested in examining the Department's process for linking resources to policy
                    objectives, something Ron Spiers and his management council were also working
                    on. Whitehead agreed to our launching special studies in each of these
                    areas.</p>
                <p>I recruited David Popper, a recently retired ambassador, to lead the study on
                    deputy assistant secretaries, and persuaded Paul Boeker, also a former
                    ambassador and an excellent economist, to study the Department's economic
                    function. But I could not find anyone willing to assess the administrative area.
                    “No thanks and good luck!” was the typical response. In some desperation, I went
                    to Whitehead and told him that if he wanted to take the chance, I would give it
                    a try myself because a review of administration was essential to our work. He
                    agreed.</p>
                <p>Most of the administrative review team came from the core group we had assembled,
                    civil service and foreign service people who were already administrative
                    experts. I recruited a few others with specialized knowledge. Again, we had the
                    indispensable cooperation of the bureaus' executive directors. We would look at
                    potential long-range economies on the premise that if work were done more
                    efficiently this would translate into savings of people and money. We had been
                    working for about four months when the State Department convinced congress to
                    restore the full $84 million cut. In four months' time, our group had produced
                    more than $20 million in savings, and no one suggested we disband. We continued
                    our work, the restoration of the cut having returned the State Department to
                    what was still an exceedingly tight budget.</p>
                <p>B Listening to People</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>One afternoon in late autumn, our team sprawled in my office as we considered how
                    to grapple with the daunting and dense subject of how the State Department is
                    actually managed. Someone described a new management improvement process called
                    the “nominal group technique.” The word “nominal” means that members of a group
                    are designated by their names, and we would select a specific cross-section of
                    participants. The concept is a form of participatory management. For us, in this
                    approach, the people who could best describe what is lacking in the
                    administrative work of the Department would be the Department's consumers and
                    providers of such administrative services themselves. We would learn what they
                    considered to be the deficiencies and, later, the remedies. We would listen to
                    people involved every day in the tasks we were examining.</p>
                <p>Nothing like this had been tried before in the State Department. There was risk
                    of failure and ridicule because people might not agree to participate
                    meaningfully, or the end product might turn out to be worthless. The State
                    Department is not a risk-taking institution. But we went ahead. We painstakingly
                    identified by name more than 400 people representative of the civil and foreign
                    services, balancing grade level and specialty. With Whitehead's backing, we
                    informed the assistant secretaries when and where we needed to have these
                    people, ranging from several of the assistant secretaries themselves to junior
                    staff. They cooperated fully, if at first with skepticism.</p>
                <p>We divided these 400 people into small groups to identify management problems as
                    they saw them. Needing a large area in which to work, we finally settled on the
                    space at 23rd Street in the lower lobby outside the Acheson Auditorium. With
                    each small group there was a professional facilitator, recruited for us by the
                    Foreign Service Institute, who was skilled in grouping individual comments on
                    large flip charts for all to see. We also had an outside consultant who advised
                    us on the use of the nominal group technique and helped us with the process
                    through its various stages.</p>
                <p>When we had completed Phase I sessions we found ourselves with a list of 733
                    separate items these groups had identified and prioritized as problems, and
                    described in ways we could understand. We organized this information into
                    clusters along thematic lines by putting each of the 733 citations on a separate
                    piece of paper and sorting them on a large table according to subject matter.
                    This process produced for us a comprehensive picture of the most troubling
                    management deficiencies in priority order.</p>
                <p>The sheer number of problems reassured us about the process and depth of
                    involvement of the participants. I had launched and then observed these group
                    sessions, and saw that in short order people were engaged among themselves and
                    with their facilitators in identifying problems in administration. Letting off
                    steam about how poorly your organization is run provides special satisfaction.
                    Most had never been asked for their views.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>Then it was on to Phase II. About three weeks had passed since our first group
                    effort, and word had spread about what we were doing. Curiosity was building up,
                    and reassuring reports reaching us about Phase I were that people liked being
                    part of it. Our phones began to ring with requests from others to join. Some of
                    the strongest support came from assistant secretaries such as Joan Clark, in
                    Consular Affairs, and this helped.</p>
                <p>As a next step we drew on some of the participants in Phase I, and about 150
                    people new to the process. We again convened them in small groups helped by
                    facilitators, and then asked each group to propose solutions to the clusters of
                    problems we had garnered from Phase I. From this effort came 933 separately
                    proposed solutions, or components of solutions. We returned to our large table
                    and matched problems and proposed solutions. Some we rejected as unworkable,
                    some we discarded because they were duplicative, but soon it became clear to us
                    what the groups perceived to be the real issues, their relative importance, and
                    the proposed remedies. As it turned out, we came up with a list of 38 leading
                    problems with solution components. These findings became the nucleus of our
                    report. It was astonishing to see the consistency of views an essentially
                    free-form process had produced. The patterns of complaint were strong and clear.
                    Priorities also emerged clearly. Most solution components were formulated with
                    reasonable precision, even in their shorthand wording.</p>
                <p>Then came Phase III, which consisted of convening groups of administrative
                    specialists from the Department's staff. We called this the “pitfall
                    identification” phase. We gave these groups the material we had organized, and
                    asked them to evaluate the identification of problems and the feasibility of
                    proposed solutions: legal and regulatory impediments, resource constraints,
                    other barriers. In short, we challenged them to poke holes in work done during
                    Phases I and II.</p>
                <p>By then we had much of the information we needed for our administrative report
                    and its recommendations. Before we put our report in final form, however, Ron
                    Spiers convened a meeting of his management council at Airlie House, in
                    Virginia, to which he invited the Department's executive directors. We took a
                    day and a half to discuss the draft report, which then went to the Whitehead
                    group along with the Popper and Boeker reports, and the Red Book analysis. The
                    executive directors signed on at Airlie House, providing useful comments and
                    improvements.</p>
                <p>What follows is a shorthand summary of how the Department's employees described
                    the ten thematic problems in administration in 1988, by priority. They are
                    basic. Anyone familiar with the State Department today will easily recognize
                    them:</p>
                <p>1Senior managers needed to establish management objectives and insure that those
                    objectives cascade down to the smallest organizational unit of the Department;
                    managers of all units need to link their resource requirements and expenditures
                    to those objectives.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>2Resources must be distributed to, and controlled by, thosofficials who are
                    responsible for their use.</p>
                <p>3Managers must consider, and be held accountable for, thresource implications of
                    their decisions.</p>
                <p>4Duplicative or inefficient elements of the bureaucracy musbe eliminated.</p>
                <p>5Managers and employees must be given personal aninstitutional incentives for
                    efficient management.</p>
                <p>6Clear lines of authority, responsibility, anaccountability must be established,
                    made known, and adhered to.</p>
                <p>7The Department must better communicate what it wants froindividuals and
                    organizations and back it up with resources.</p>
                <p>8The Department must develop better managers.</p>
                <p>9Once set, management policy must be implemented.</p>
                <p>10The Department must regularly review resource usage.</p>
                <p>C “The Administrative Function for the 1990s” - A report</p>
                <p>Our report was entitled “The Administrative Function for the 1990s: A Report
                    Prepared for the Deputy Secretary's Steering Group,” and was issued in June,
                    1988. It had taken us six months to complete it. Of the 38 major recommendations
                    included in the report, 32 were eventually implemented, some in revised
                    form.</p>
                <p>The offices of greatest resistance to change were in Personnel, even though many
                    of our most significant recommendations applied to that function. We dealt with
                    foreign service and civil service recruitment, assignments, training,
                    promotions, career development, interchangeability, performance evaluation,
                    awards, sanctions, and more. But nothing changed in Personnel, to this day one
                    of the most inert, wasteful, and mismanaged functions at State.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>A major theme of our report was that many activities, especially in Personnel,
                    should be decentralized to the lowest organizational level at which operations
                    were actually being performed. The State Department over the years had become
                    rigid and top-heavy. As we looked at private sector trends, we found that the
                    Department's predicament was not different from that of many large corporations,
                    which had at various times, and again in the late 1980s, emphasized devolution
                    of authority and responsibility. If Shultz and Whitehead had remained in office,
                    they would have made needed management reforms in the Department's
                    activities.</p>
                <p>When James A. Baker became secretary, he brought with him a new team which was
                    not nearly as interested in management issues. The two under secretaries for
                    management under Baker were new to the Department and its work, and could not be
                    expected to begin where Shultz and Whitehead left off. In Washington, moreover,
                    new administrations are believed to represent new departures. Among political
                    appointees, the mindset usually is: “If we didn't invent this, it can't be any
                    good!”</p>
                <p>Direct and explicit linkage between resources and policy objectives is essential,
                    a goal that has always eluded the Department. Ten years later, not much has
                    improved at State. Four years after our work, came the “State 2000” report, a
                    masterful in-house review of the foreign policy process. “State 2000” urged many
                    of the same reforms we and others had sought, but its findings and
                    recommendations were ignored as Clinton's people took charge. Vice President
                    Gore's “Reinventing Government” report on the State Department has as its
                    principal recommendation (once again!) that the Department link its resource use
                    closely to policy objectives. In order to accomplish this, the secretary of
                    state should be made responsible for all foreign affairs resources (including
                    development and military assistance) in what is called the 150 International
                    Account. Gore's report found that ambassadors overseas should have analogous
                    authority and responsibility. No progress whatever has been made in this
                    direction, largely because secretaries of state have not fought for change.</p>
                <p>In the end, we filled a four-drawer file cabinet with studies of Red Book items
                    and our special reviews. We saved studies on hundreds of management subjects
                    with reports on the disposition of each, and an analysis of what worked and did
                    not on every item we examined. We left thorough documentation in the certain
                    knowledge that the ground we had covered would be revisited. It was our
                    responsibility, we felt, to provide our successors a foundation from which to
                    start. But there is no institutional memory. When State 2000 began, its members
                    were interested in finding that file cabinet. It has not yet been located.</p>
                <p>This again supports the need for creating a position of permanent under
                    secretary, and filling it with a career person who will remain in place as
                    administrations change. The State Department's new leaders are always tempted to
                    reinvent the wheel in policy and management issues. At the very least, they
                    should know where their predecessors left off.</p>
                <p>19DIRECTOR, FOREIGN SERVICE INSTITUTE: 1988-92</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>A Opportunities Without Precedent</p>
                <p>When Secretary of State Shultz offered me the directorship of the Foreign Service
                    Institute in the summer of 1988 after my service as ambassador in Zaire, it was
                    the job I wanted most. No other secretary was as committed to strengthening
                    training as he and the senior team around him. Thanks to his efforts with
                    congress, and those of two of my predecessors, Ambassadors Stephen Low and
                    Charles Bray, we had before us the prospect of constructing a training facility
                    for FSI, from the ground up, at nearby Arlington Hall in Virginia. Here was
                    probably the only chance to give training an appropriate home. I also knew that
                    the FSI directorship until then had been a career dead-end leading to retirement
                    but thought little about it, buoyed as I was by Shultz's engagement and
                    support.</p>
                <p>My involvement with the Foreign Service Institute began in April of 1959, when I
                    joined some twenty other recruits to the Foreign Service in the A-100
                    orientation seminar for junior officers. It is still the A-100 class, but its
                    approach has gone beyond “orientation,” and the manner of presentation beyond
                    “talking heads,” as we called those who merely lectured to us. FSI was located
                    at that time in a converted basement garage at Arlington Towers, an apartment
                    complex in Rosslyn, Virginia. Before that, a former private residence in Foggy
                    Bottom served as a school for novice diplomats, and much earlier, training took
                    place in the Executive Office Building next to the White House.</p>
                <p>On my way to Berlin in 1965, I returned to Arlington Towers for three months
                    during summer to polish up my German. I also took one-week courses from time to
                    time on such subjects as “The Nature of Communism,” “Economics for Political
                    Officers,” and “Negotiation.” The first two I attended while serving in Berlin;
                    to my delight they were offered in London through a donation by Raymond Guest. I
                    had the privilege of being in the 14th Senior Seminar, by then located on the
                    top floor of FSI's main building in Rosslyn. The view from its large windows of
                    nearly all of Washington, spread out before us across the Potomac, seemed a
                    world removed from the cheerless learning environment of the Arlington Towers
                    garage.</p>
                <p>And now, while the Cold War was not yet over, one could sense that great changes
                    were imminent and would originate in Central Europe. These, in turn, would
                    profoundly affect training needs. Gorbachev was exciting to watch. This
                    assignment closed a circle. I had begun my career nearly thirty years earlier at
                    the height of the Cold War, and would have an opportunity to apply what I had
                    learned to every aspect of training as that struggle ended. I did not at all
                    anticipate the difficulties FSI would encounter once George Shultz left
                    office.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>There is a traditional lack of interest in training among the Department's senior
                    managers. It would be the battle of my career to maintain support for the
                    desperately needed facilities we were planning to build at Arlington Hall.
                    Training must constantly change to reflect the times. No sooner has a course of
                    instruction been designed than it needs to be reviewed for relevance and brought
                    up to date at the edges. The cowboy in a Cormac McCarthy novel who is asked
                    whether he knew the world would never be the same, wisely replies: “I know it.
                    It ain't now.” A modern-day Heraclitus, that man.</p>
                <p>Our understanding of how economic forces in a global society are linked deepens;
                    the so-called global issues themselves are nearing the top of international
                    agendas; management of information requires understanding of technology and
                    information flows; multilateral diplomacy in such areas as peacekeeping and
                    global warming is being redefined; countering terrorism demands urgent
                    attention; the nature of intellectual property is debated; human rights concerns
                    are increasingly accepted as a basis for conditioning foreign policy; the
                    geography and alliances of the post-Cold War world are transformed following the
                    break-up of the Soviet Union; US interests in nearly every corner of the world
                    are slowly being realigned. Such changes reshape the State Department's training
                    requirements as they are caught up, like tumbleweed, in a rolling process that
                    cannot be stopped. The challenge is to get ahead of the curve and find funding
                    to match needs.</p>
                <p>While training imparts knowledge, its primary focus is on building skills.
                    Secretarial functions have forever been altered by computers: in today's world
                    everyone working in foreign affairs must be computer-literate. Innovative
                    progress has been made in concepts of organization and management, such as the
                    common use of ad hoc teams for specific tasks. Leadership and people-skills,
                    greatly lacking in government, can be imparted in sophisticated new ways.
                    Prospective ambassadors can be taught how to do their jobs. Managers can be
                    trained to seek diversity and ensure equality of opportunity.</p>
                <p>Developing synergy between business, private voluntary organizations, and
                    government lends itself to analysis and instruction. So do crisis management,
                    public diplomacy, and the cultivation of negotiating skills. The use of gaming
                    techniques to act out scenarios of international behavior under specified
                    circumstances, and then absorb the lessons learned and uses of preventive
                    diplomacy, has gained acceptance at senior levels of the State Department, as
                    well as budgetary support from congress. Crisis management is a process one can
                    teach.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>Training at FSI is also intended to develop professionalism, the motivation that
                    comes from being engaged in worthwhile work—with its own values, standards and
                    rewards—that is not just another job. Two hundred and twenty years of American
                    diplomacy are on record. FSI should be a place of inspiration for everyone who
                    goes there. Each student should emerge with enhanced knowledge, skills, and
                    motivation. No other part of the State Department is capable of transmitting the
                    values of the Foreign Service, its ethos and esprit de corps. Paradoxically, few
                    at State think of FSI as having this function, or are concerned about
                    perpetuating a common core of values, or even seem to care what these might be.
                    This leaves a great deal in the hands of FSI's staff, and never more than at a
                    time of revolutionary change such as the ending of the Cold War which, as it
                    happened, occurred on my watch.</p>
                <p>B Working at FSI in Rosslyn</p>
                <p>Two high-rise, converted office buildings in Rosslyn accommodated the Foreign
                    Service Institute in the 1970s and '80s. One of these was a narrow 14-story
                    structure, which we occupied entirely. We also rented one-third of a similar
                    building two long blocks away. Both buildings' elevators, which were not
                    designed for heavy traffic, took notoriously long to arrive and caused problems
                    of delay and frustration for students and staff each day. Anyone wanting to get
                    from consular training to Chinese language class in a rainstorm got wet. In the
                    main FSI building, senior management was located on the top floor, isolated from
                    other operations in appearance and fact. Our offices had spectacular views, but
                    were in the wrong place.</p>
                <p>Both buildings were overcrowded. The halls were dingy, with walls that needed
                    paint. It was either too hot or too cold in the classrooms. The furniture was
                    terminally tacky. The A-100 course, which was conducted in the second building,
                    occupied a cavernous, windowless room with blue walls that reminded me of the
                    hold of a cargo ship. Despite these conditions, FSI had an extremely capable
                    staff of some 550 people committed to their work. More than half were engaged in
                    language training. By the time I left FSI, we were teaching 67 languages, all of
                    them by native speakers. Such a broad range of requirements in language
                    instruction became difficult to meet as the US opened posts in the former Soviet
                    republics that became independent. There were problems, for example, in
                    persuading a young instructor and his family to move from Ulaanbaatar to Rosslyn
                    in order to teach Mongolian. On any given day, we trained about 1,200 students
                    from State and some 40 other agencies engaged in foreign affairs. We had four
                    language and area training schools overseas: Arabic in Tunis, Korean in Seoul,
                    Japanese in Yokohama, and Chinese in Taipei. FSI was like a small university
                    with foreign branches, and we had many of the same management problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>Despite deplorable conditions, people working there showed remarkable enthusiasm
                    and energy. The credit for this goes to staff and students alike. We were
                    inspected shortly before moving to the new campus, and Foreign Service
                    inspectors made a particular point of praising morale throughout FSI. The staff
                    knew they were engaged in work that mattered, and their enthusiasm proved
                    contagious. Each year, the language school held a Christmas party in the
                    hold-like A-100 classroom. It was crowded by tables with dishes from all over
                    the world, prepared and served by teachers and their families from many
                    different countries. For a day, FSI offered the best ethnic food in Washington.
                    Such generosity comes only from people who love what they are doing and are
                    proud of their roots.</p>
                <p>C Managing FSI</p>
                <p>FSI had a discretionary yearly budget of over $16 million for training, beyond
                    the fixed costs of salaries and expenses. With this, FSI provided 1.6 million
                    instructional hours every year. We thought of our resources as money, people,
                    time, space, and ideas; all were in play as we planned ahead. I cannot discuss
                    FSI without mentioning Dr. John T. Sprott, who by 1988 had been its deputy
                    director for more than six years. John is tall and professorial in dress and
                    bearing, with a grey beard and happy look in his eyes. He was in every sense
                    “Mr. Training,” our permanent headmaster. He was recognized for his efforts by
                    an ambassadorial assignment to the Kingdom of Lesotho, a rare occurrence since
                    John was a civil service employee. John's contributions to training and to
                    building Arlington Hall have been indispensable to FSI's achievements.</p>
                <p>John and I took the senior staff each year to an off-site overnight retreat in
                    the countryside. There, we could lean back in our chairs, discuss the present,
                    and plan ahead. Before we left for our off-site conferences, the deans of our
                    specialized schools and their executive directors held meetings with their own
                    staffs to elicit ideas and build consensus on objectives and budgets. Senior
                    managers came to these conferences with the considered judgments and targets of
                    their staffs.</p>
                <p>At the end of our first off-site meeting I was asked what my vision was. On a
                    large paper chart I wrote: “One FSI,” because I was concerned about
                    compartmentalization between our schools caused—but only partly—by the physical
                    barriers of separate, multistoried office buildings. After the second off-site,
                    I added “...doing things differently,” meaning that our training needed to
                    reflect changing priorities at the Cold War's end. At the third annual off-site,
                    I wrote “...at Arlington Hall.” By then we had nearly completed construction of
                    our new home. “One FSI doing things differently at Arlington Hall,” thus became
                    our corporate vision for four years beginning in 1988, one that was fully
                    realized.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>Following our off-site conferences, I invited FSI staff and students to a general
                    meeting held in a church across the street from the main FSI building in
                    Rosslyn. This church, a well known landmark, was perched on top of an EXXON
                    gasoline station at a major intersection. We rented it for large meetings and
                    fondly called it “Our Lady of the Fumes.” At these meetings, we provided
                    summaries of what took place at the off-site sessions, described the conclusions
                    we had reached about future directions, and tried to build broad-based
                    support.</p>
                <p>When we were routinely inspected in 1991, Foreign Service Inspectors took a close
                    look at this process and, in their report, cited it as a model for other State
                    Department bureaus to emulate because it uniquely brought goals, priorities,
                    resource requirements and responsibilities for implementation together in one
                    process. This inspection was the first time a State Department bureau, as
                    opposed to an overseas post, had been singled out to receive the Department's
                    annual “Secretary's Award” for excellence in management. Here, immodestly, is
                    what was said about me:</p>
                <p>“Morale at FSI is high. [The director's] confident and cheerful bearing, his
                    enthusiasm and genuine sense of job satisfaction are infectious. His style is
                    consensual; he is a good listener; he is willing to make decisions andtake
                    risks.”</p>
                <p>In general FSI was a self-contained and autonomous unit, with its director
                    ranking equivalent to an assistant secretary. We were pretty much masters of our
                    own ship, situated across the Potomac River from the mainstream of the State
                    Department's work. We were independent of other agencies, concentrating on our
                    educational and professional objectives, but we consulted them and got what
                    guidance we could from them. We were, unfortunately, never able to create a
                    board of advisers drawn from other agencies such as Agriculture and Defense, or
                    even from our foreign policy sisters in USIA and AID, a board that would support
                    and help us shape our training. No one at sufficiently high levels in these
                    bureaucracies wanted to spare the time. At State and elsewhere, managers
                    remained indifferent to the training function, except when it came to their
                    particular concerns, as in developing specific and urgently needed language,
                    consular, or administrative skills.</p>
                <p>D Training Priorities</p>
                <p>Our first task, always, was to maintain the quality and relevance of 1.6 million
                    hours of instruction annually. We decided to strengthen economic and commercial
                    training, and enlisted the Business Council for International Understanding, in
                    New York, to advise us. Its staff helped design course content and provided
                    speakers from the private sector. We made economic/commercial work part of the
                    broadest possible training by emphasizing its importance, for example, to the
                    consular function. It is the vice consuls abroad who grant visas to foreign
                    business people seeking to visit the US. Our commercial section at an embassy
                    could help them make contacts with US firms, if they were informed of such
                    travel.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>We expanded and improved our executive development and leadership programs for
                    supervisors at all levels. We started a course for people in their first
                    supervisory responsibilities, and improved upon already sophisticated courses
                    for deputy chiefs of mission and ambassadorial seminars for newly appointed
                    chiefs of mission. These were about leadership and effective management of
                    resources. Attendance was mandatory. Recruiting for our other leadership
                    offerings was an uphill struggle, because most State Department people
                    incorrectly believe they are already good managers.</p>
                <p>In my view the ambassadorial seminar, the A-100 course for new officers, and the
                    DCM seminar formed a training triangle. Each needed to understand the
                    obligations and concerns of the others and how they were linked in differing
                    roles. The lines connecting them bound together people at varying stages in
                    their careers, yet performing within a common area of professional standards and
                    expectations. My colleagues at FSI instilled these standards and provoked
                    discussion, at each level, of institutional values and responsibilities to
                    others: the president, congress and ultimately the American people.</p>
                <p>From a training standpoint, FSI becomes the link between ambassadors, DCMs and
                    junior officers. I met three times with each A-100 class: on their first day to
                    welcome them and set the tone; during a brown bag lunch at midpoint to get their
                    reactions to the course and field their questions; and at graduation to talk
                    about assignments they had just received, some of them as exotic as my own, in
                    earlier days, to Abidjan. It mattered a great deal who the FSI course leader was
                    in terms of what that individual could impart by word and especially attitude,
                    over ten weeks, to such an eagerly receptive group. I have consistently been
                    impressed by the high caliber of people joining the Foreign Service, and by
                    speedy progress in achieving racial and gender balance. We could not have had
                    better women and men as trainers.</p>
                <p>I joined the DCM Seminar at its off-site session on the first day, and spent an
                    afternoon and dinner with these prospective deputies to ambassadors to talk
                    about their future roles and relationships, emphasizing the central management
                    responsibilities of the DCM. I talked at length about the ambassador-DCM
                    relationship, the most delicate and potentially troublesome pairing of people in
                    diplomatic life. There is a saying that the largest graveyard in the foreign
                    service is filled with DCMs. It helped that I had been the deputy in Berlin to a
                    political ambassador as we opened a new embassy. Here again, FSI's course
                    leaders performed with distinction throughout two weeks of training, as attested
                    to repeatedly by the course evaluations.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>FSI's two-week Ambassadorial Seminar has been described separately in Foreign
                    Service oral histories. [See also Chapter 4, American Ambassadors in a Troubled
                    World, by Dayton Mak and Charles Stuart Kennedy, Greenwood Press, 1992] During
                    the late Reagan and Bush administrations, I designed and led 13 two-week
                    seminars for over 150 newly-appointed ambassadors and their spouses. The
                    indispensable private sector co-chairman, Langhorne (Tony) Motley, and I
                    emphasized the leadership responsibilities of an ambassador over all elements of
                    the US government at the embassy, especially the intelligence function, and the
                    critical nature of a successful relationship with the DCM, “who, aside from your
                    spouse, is likely to be your only other true friend at post,” to quote Motley.
                    We stressed to politically appointed ambassadors, initially suspicious of the
                    Foreign Service, that the future prospects of the embassy's professionals rested
                    on the success of the ambassador. They could be counted on for support, as well
                    as advice worth listening to.</p>
                <p>Training foreign diplomats became a concern. The requirement to explore such
                    training was first levied on us by the Bureau of European Affairs. We had
                    previous experience to get us started. There had been at least three other
                    occasions on which FSI was involved in training foreign diplomats: when we
                    trained Israeli diplomats in 1948 for the new state of Israel; when training was
                    provided to Philippine diplomats after World War II; and when, by legislation,
                    FSI was directed to train Micronesian diplomats as these tiny islands achieved
                    independence.</p>
                <p>We focused our attention on teaching the conduct of diplomacy in its many
                    aspects. Georgetown University showed great interest in the project as did a
                    number of our sister institutions in other foreign ministries, particularly in
                    Vienna, where the Diplomatic Academy was already involved in this kind of
                    training. The directors of such diplomatic training institutions met annually,
                    some thirty or so of us from all over of the world. During sessions I attended
                    in Cairo, Vienna and Washington, we discussed how we might help new foreign
                    ministries and their untrained diplomats in countries created after the breakup
                    of the Soviet Union. FSI's role in this function became a growing one.</p>
                <p>E Building the National Foreign Affairs Training Center</p>
                <p>By the time I arrived at FSI in the summer of 1988, the State Department had
                    obtained agreement that land for a construction site would be transferred to it
                    by the US Army, then occupying Arlington Hall as a signals intelligence
                    facility, INTSCOM. There was already a footprint for new buildings, and a
                    comprehensive construction budget. We worked closely with Congressman Frank Wolf
                    (Republican, VA), in whose district this facility was to be built. By 1988, we
                    thus had a concept, congressional backers, and the full support of George
                    Shultz' State Department from the top down. We had not formally acquired the 72
                    acres of Arlington Hall from the Army, although the agreement for doing so had
                    been signed.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>The leading architect selected was a young man, Alan Greenberger, from the
                    Philadelphia firm of MGA Partners. As part of the design contract, MGA staff and
                    architects immersed themselves in the activities of FSI in Rosslyn, in order to
                    understand how every component of our institution functioned so they could
                    determine what the physical requirements would be for each. What were we doing
                    and how we were doing it came together as this team pondered our needs. Alan
                    designed a 500,000 square foot complex that would cost an estimated $81
                    million.</p>
                <p>My greatest concern at FSI throughout my tenure was the design and construction
                    of Arlington Hall, a task that became increasingly time consuming. My
                    predecessor, Steve Low, took the first steps in this direction by finding the
                    Arlington Hall, Virginia, property on Route 50 between Glebe Road and George
                    Mason Drive, which is now the site of the new institute. Ronald Spiers, the
                    under secretary of state for management, supported Steve at every turn. But it
                    is Secretary George Shultz who is the godfather of this facility. He dealt with
                    congress on the issue initially, and made the case for it because he believed in
                    the need for training. Deputy Secretary John C. Whitehead once told me Shultz
                    considered himself to be primarily an educator, despite several top-level
                    government posts after his deanship of the Graduate School of Business at the
                    University of Chicago. Whitehead said Shultz regarded the FSI campus as his
                    legacy to the State Department. It fell to me to take the project through the
                    design, funding and construction phases.</p>
                <p>Our concern was to design a facility that made sense in training terms. We placed
                    language training and testing next to each other, and area studies alongside. We
                    located the director's office and administrative offices at the heart of the
                    complex. We put the classrooms for the A-100 course for junior officers nearby,
                    so they would feel they were at the center of our activities. We installed a
                    satellite dish to deliver inter-active video training, live, to foreign service
                    posts throughout the world. We wired the new buildings with as many computer
                    outlets as possible, even though we knew we could use only a fraction of this
                    capacity initially. We required the architects to design the buildings and
                    interiors to provide classroom flexibility in size and function, through movable
                    panels, which would permit our successors to adapt readily to changing
                    requirements. The cafeteria would be large, modern and open to sunlight and the
                    broad meadow outside.</p>
                <p>The temperature could be controlled in every room, and there would be a centrally
                    regulated clock in each part of the facility. Controlling the clocks was a big
                    point with me. The State Department has hundreds of wall clocks, few of which
                    are accurate. I will never forget overhearing a visitor say in an elevator,
                    “These people don't even know what time it is!”</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>On October 25, 1989 the US Army formally transferred 72 acres of Arlington Hall
                    to us, and we began our work. Arlington Hall had been built in the early 1920s
                    as a girls' finishing school. It was never very successful. The campus then
                    consisted primarily of one yellow brick building, “Old Main,” which still
                    stands, a gymnasium, and a riding stable which no longer exists. The white-clad
                    ghost of a girl named Mary, who according to lore became pregnant and committed
                    suicide, is said to roam the halls where we now have the Overseas Briefing
                    Center. The school ran into financial difficulties during the Depression. The
                    property was ideally situated near Washington. The Roosevelt administration took
                    it over in the early 1940s to house the communications analysis unit, the
                    operation that played a key role in breaking the Japanese “Purple” code before
                    World War II. Arlington Hall remained a cryptographic installation until its
                    Army unit left for larger quarters in October, 1989. When the State Department
                    took it over, it reverted to its educational function, an appropriate closing of
                    a circle in Arlington County's history.</p>
                <p>We began by demolishing more than fifty World War II barracks in run-down
                    condition. Once when Sprott and I went out there, we found ourselves standing in
                    the rubble of what had been the officers' club—the last building to be abandoned
                    by its former owners, of course. I saw a scrap of wall paper on the ground,
                    picked it up and had it framed alongside a picture of the pile of rubble as a
                    salute to the past. When dealing with run-down property, one is bound to
                    encounter nasty surprises. One, which cost us an unexpected $1 million, was for
                    asbestos removal, a problem not foreseen or provided for in our original
                    calculations.</p>
                <p>About one-third into the project, our anticipated financial resources were
                    reduced, requiring us to scale down plans for the three wings that now house the
                    main training activities, and eliminate a fourth wing entirely. But we stayed
                    within our budget, despite cutbacks and the need to trim our design.</p>
                <p>The architectural plan was developed as a “village” concept, and the campus has
                    an enclosed feeling. We wanted to put a pond in a natural drainage depression in
                    the middle of the large green meadow, but that too, had to be given up. Some day
                    I hope it will be built, because for engineering as well as aesthetic reasons it
                    belongs there. We made arrangements to acquire a seated statue of Benjamin
                    Franklin, then lost in shrubbery in front of the State Department's entrance,
                    and to place it prominently in the main court where it has become a magnet for
                    class pictures and the simple pleasures of sitting on a bench with Ben, the
                    first and one of the most effective of our nation's ambassadors.</p>

                <p>So many of our limitations and problems at Rosslyn served as cautionary lessons
                    in our planning for Arlington Hall. Having to get from one FSI building to
                    another in open weather in Rosslyn led me to the idea of building two glass
                    covered bridges to connect the buildings on our campus. Now, every part of FSI
                    is accessible without having to go outdoors, and those who walk the bridges can
                    see the trees and colors, the rain and snow. These connections are also
                    important to the concept of “one FSI.” I insisted the facility be seen as a
                    whole, not as a collection of discrete training activities, and its buildings
                    had to reflect that vision. We wanted people to feel they were all part of a
                    single, integrated activity called foreign affairs training. Furthermore, we
                    were interested in developing a “shirt sleeve” atmosphere no matter what the
                    weather was. We wanted students and faculty to be able to go from one course to
                    another, to meals and the library, without having to bundle up. People would be
                    less inclined to engage in informal conversations and get to know one another if
                    they had to put their coats on first. The architects liked the idea and
                    incorporated it into their design.</p>
                <p>We involved everyone at FSI as we developed our plans. We wanted staff and
                    students to feel they had contributed to the design of the facility in which
                    they would work, and we got excellent ideas from them. As we developed this
                    project at Rosslyn, excitement about what the future would hold began to mount.
                    Offices and people outside of government became involved and were crucial to the
                    project's success. One such group was the Virginia Historical Association, in
                    Richmond. They required us to keep the old main building of the girls' school.
                    The Association found it to be of historic value as architecture of a bygone
                    era, and a landmark in military history for the cryptographic work done there
                    during World War II. This requirement presented a challenge of its own: how
                    could the large, yellow brick building be integrated in a functional way into a
                    newly built red brick campus? In fact, saving the old building turned out to be
                    a major asset to the complex for its usefulness and dignified appearance that
                    evokes an earlier era.</p>
                <p>There are two white and ugly cottages abutting Route 50 we were also obliged to
                    keep. The Historical Association believed they were Sears Roebuck prefabricated
                    houses dating back to 1929, and therefore of historic interest. I found it
                    curious, even unsettling, that something built in 1929, the year of my birth,
                    was already designated a “historic” site. To this day, they stand there and
                    house the property managers. We also had to keep the narrow little gymnasium,
                    because it had been part of the girls' school.</p>
                <p>We needed approval from the National Capitol Planning Commission in Washington,
                    and I testified on design and use before that Commission. We easily obtained
                    their support. This was not our experience with the Bicycle Association, by far
                    the most intransigent group we had to deal with. The campus design had a bicycle
                    path running around it which the Association felt should pass through the
                    campus. We spent many hours figuring out ways to route a path which would
                    satisfy the Association's demands, and not compromise our security
                    requirements.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Then there were the neighborhood groups. We held evening meetings with them at
                    the beginning of the process, but despite our efforts we got some bad press at
                    the outset, because a few people alleged we were ignoring the well-being of the
                    neighborhood and would bring in too many cars. That story upset Congressman
                    Wolfe, and we had to calm him down. Later on, these efforts paid off; our future
                    neighbors became some of our strongest supporters. Their interests were
                    legitimate. We persuaded them that the training center would be an asset to the
                    community, and would not disrupt the area with new traffic. Their children would
                    not be at any additional risk while walking to school. We told them we would be
                    willing to make part of the facility available to the neighborhood for its
                    community functions.</p>
                <p>One of the requirements, in a venture like this, is to hold an advertised open
                    meeting for neighborhood residents. We held ours in a rented church in Rosslyn
                    in the winter of 1989, on a particularly cold evening as it was beginning to
                    snow. About fifty people braved the elements and showed up. I chaired the
                    meeting. Some expressed reservations and were antagonistic about such potential
                    problems as traffic, parking, destruction of trees, noise, and the impact on
                    back yards adjacent to the property. One long-time resident was particularly
                    incensed, and condemned our project roundly.</p>
                <p>I recognized an elderly woman sitting in the front row, having no idea who she
                    was. She introduced herself as Louise Hale, telling us she had graduated from
                    the Arlington Hall girls' school. Silence descended. She went on to say she
                    thought our proposal was wonderful and had the full support of the Alumnae
                    Society. For us, this was the crowning moment. We knew the community would be
                    behind us, and they were. God bless Mrs. Hale! We invited her and all other
                    graduates of Arlington Hall we could find to our inauguration as a successor
                    educational institution, and they came.</p>
                <p>When George Shultz first presented the concept of a training center to congress,
                    he decided that “Foreign Service Institute” sounded too parochial. He wanted to
                    emphasize that the new facility was not just for the Foreign Service, or even
                    primarily for the Department of State, but rather that it would serve all
                    agencies of the executive branch. He believed this approach would gain support
                    from congressional budget and appropriations committees. For that reason, the
                    name “National Foreign Affairs Training Center,” a tortured appellation, came
                    into being. People usually refer to the campus now as Arlington Hall, and still
                    call it the “Foreign Service Institute,” but formally it is the “National
                    Foreign Affairs Training Center,” with the unfortunate acronym “En-fatsy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>Today, if you were to view Arlington Hall from the air, you would see its
                    buildings form a large letter A, tilted to the left on its woodland plot. That
                    is how it looked to us, anyway, during the many hours we studied the architects'
                    drawings. The crossbar is a connecting, glass-encased walkway that joins two
                    main wings; a similar walkway at the peak connects the new buildings to the
                    yellow colonial-style girls' school. Built of red bricks tinged with green
                    called Rosewood Norman bricks, because they are longer and narrower than others,
                    the new buildings are flat-roofed and contain as many windows as one could
                    rationally design. The ends of corridors have large panes of glass letting in
                    light. Where there wasn't room for rectangular windows, the architects designed
                    round ones. The interior is aglow with light, and to my delight I have heard
                    students remark on this. Looking out the windows, you see grass, shrubs, and old
                    trees: buds in springtime, thick heavy green in summer, Virginia's autumn
                    colors, and snow on the ground that reflects lights from the classrooms as the
                    days become shorter.</p>
                <p>F Downgrading Training</p>
                <p>The Bush administration brought with it unexpected problems for FSI and the
                    Arlington Hall construction project. The transition from secretaries Shultz to
                    Baker imposed such sweeping changes in senior appointments one would have
                    thought the Democrats had won. It took us at FSI several months to understand
                    the magnitude of what had happened. Under Shultz, we had thrived in heydays of
                    support for training and, in hindsight, were slower than we should have been to
                    realize that it was going to be different under Baker.</p>
                <p>The signs were there. As Ivan Selin, the newly designated under secretary for
                    management, was preparing for his senate confirmation hearings, I invited him to
                    visit FSI, see what we were doing and receive briefings on the construction
                    project from a training perspective. He chose not to, and in fact did not come
                    to FSI during his tenure in order to meet the staff, walk through the facilities
                    at Rosslyn, or receive a comprehensive briefing on the Department's training and
                    its future. He appeared once to visit the Russian language section, claiming
                    enough skill in Russian to “get the job done.” The linguists were not
                    impressed.</p>
                <p>Ivan Selin had been one of Robert McNamara's “whiz kids,” the young, highly
                    intelligent and impatient systems analysts in the Defense Department in the
                    mid-1960s whose quantification skills revolutionized abilities to deal with
                    enormous amounts of information in systematic ways. He came to the State
                    Department from American Management Systems, a company he had co-founded, with
                    the commendable mandate of bringing order and modern practices to management.
                    Inner-driven, he was not a “people person;” he was not disposed to learn by
                    listening to others, but preferred his own conceptual models to shape his
                    decisions. In the end, State turned out to be the wrong place for Ivan's
                    talents, and he left after two years to head the Nuclear Regulatory
                    Commission.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>During his first off-site management meeting at a country retreat called The
                    Woods, Ivan indicated that funds for Arlington Hall were not a top priority for
                    the Department's building program. The Department was working under serious
                    budget constraints, I argued, but the development of a new training facility was
                    a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and congress had already committed itself to
                    funding the project. I left this session disturbed about our prospects and it
                    soon became clear the campus project was in trouble.</p>
                <p>After the departures of Shultz, Whitehead, and Spiers in early 1989, the low
                    level of interest in training on the part of the Department's new senior
                    managers became evident. Before the changeover, I met weekly with Shultz and his
                    under secretaries, usually on a Friday morning for fifteen minutes, to bring
                    this small group up to date on training and get their views on issues as they
                    came up. Sometimes I would take an FSI colleague along to give the secretary a
                    first-hand report, and make our staff visible to him. This atmosphere evaporated
                    in the new administration. There were no regular meetings on the Seventh Floor
                    to address training or progress on the construction project. What we did
                    encounter was unexpected opposition to construction of the training facility on
                    the part of Ivan Selin, and his new director general, Edward J. Perkins. Ed
                    Perkins entered the Foreign Service laterally in 1972, having had previous
                    careers in the Far East with the Army and Air Force Exchange Services, and in
                    management work at AID. Prior to assuming the personnel responsibilities of
                    director general, he served as our ambassador to Liberia and South Africa. At
                    Baker's behest, strengthening State's minority recruitment programs became a
                    centerpiece of his concerns.</p>
                <p>Selin, who had no previous State Department experience, determined before his
                    arrival that the Foreign Service Institute should be made part of the director
                    general's office, rather than remain an independent entity reporting directly to
                    him. In my first meeting with Ivan, I argued that such a move would be a mistake
                    for many reasons, not least that the training staff was larger than the office
                    of personnel and their combination would be unmanageable. What would be the
                    advantage of adding a layer between the director of FSI and Ivan, as under
                    secretary for management? And between FSI and other elements of the Department
                    at the assistant secretary level, with whom we dealt all the time? I was
                    concerned, above all, that the training function, traditionally undervalued in
                    the State Department, would be viewed as having been downgraded. Other
                    government structures such as CIA and the military kept their training functions
                    separate from personnel, as did leading corporations, to emphasize their
                    independence and the different nature of training from personnel work. State's
                    personnel operations, moreover, were beset by major problems of their own which
                    needed a director general's full attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>A fundamental flaw in this proposal, I suggested, would be elimination of a
                    natural and healthy tension between responsibilities for assignments and
                    training. If FSI were to become integrated into the director general's office
                    the assignment function, with its real and imagined pressures, would always win
                    over training. It was already difficult enough for FSI to insist on training in
                    discussions with the assignments division, whose first priority was to fill
                    vacancies. Training does consume time, but to assign people when they are
                    inadequately prepared for their responsibilities is wasteful and unfair to the
                    employee and prospective supervisor.</p>
                <p>Selin's argument boiled down to the fact that since we trained people, anything
                    to do with people belonged under one supervisor, the director general. It was
                    the same argument that caused the Medical Division and Family Liaison Office to
                    become appendages of Personnel, although the issues in these instances are
                    different. Congress, upon being notified, as required, of Selin's reorganization
                    plans, put a hold on them as they concerned FSI until the training facility was
                    operational, at which time it was willing to review his proposal. This
                    forestalled further action on consolidation during Selin's tenure.</p>
                <p>As director of FSI, I was nonetheless cut off by Ivan from senior management
                    councils, no longer participating in weekly management staff meetings. Selin did
                    not receive first-hand reports of our activities, objectives and problems. These
                    were not fully conveyed to him by the director general, whose weekly meetings I
                    did attend, because the latter was concerned with personnel problems that were
                    more pressing. At the same time, I had no systematic way of knowing what
                    management's interests were, what it saw as new challenges, and what the
                    implications of its deliberations would be for training. There was no way to
                    enhance these discussions by talking about training needs, because no one was
                    there to do so.</p>
                <p>Selin viewed the training function largely as “nuts and bolts” and “dirty
                    fingernails” work, as he described it to me. He saw FSI's function primarily as
                    providing language training, and instruction in technical matters such as
                    secretarial, consular, and administrative skills. This view put FSI's Senior
                    Seminar and Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs in jeopardy. Obtaining funds
                    for these programs was a continuing challenge, and eventually the Center was
                    abolished by Selin's successor, John F.W. Rogers.</p>
                <p>Secretary Baker took an hour and a half to visit FSI early in his tenure. He met
                    the senior staff and gave a warm talk to combined A-100 and DCM classes on his
                    views of the role of training in foreign affairs, all of which was helpful.
                    Baker was personally supportive of training. Not a manager by instinct, he had
                    policy issues all over the world demanding his attention as the Soviet Union
                    imploded. Selin visited the campus construction site once or twice, and remained
                    skeptical about the need for such a project, although by this time demolition of
                    most of the old barracks had taken place and initial funds were committed. Ivan
                    told me that if the campus were not so far along, he would have stopped it. The
                    director general was equally, and loyally, skeptical.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>There is an anti-intellectual bias in the State Department, sometimes among its
                    best and brightest, which is surprising to encounter given the nature of its
                    work. This bias is most strongly held by people responsible for the budget,
                    whose inclinations are to shy away from priorities in training beyond its trade
                    school aspects. When the Department's leadership is not vocal in supporting
                    training, which means insisting on funds for it, and that training be provided,
                    the system takes over. Training becomes a low priority, particularly in the
                    personnel function, of all places, which feels the heat to fill vacancies
                    promptly, often disregarding its responsibility to insure that people are
                    qualified and prepared for their assignments.</p>
                <p>If one were to assign blame, it would be to the Department's foreign service
                    officers themselves who often care little about their own professional
                    development through training, greatly needed in management and leadership
                    skills, much less that of their subordinates. Getting a warm body into the job,
                    as the expression goes, is the short-sighted goal. The howls and screams come
                    later, when it is discovered that these hastily placed warm bodies lack needed
                    skills and are performing poorly. And nowhere is this more evident than with
                    secretarial and administrative staffs, where poor performance is highly visible.
                    Not fair!</p>
                <p>Selin's successor, John F.W. Rogers, adopted the views of his predecessor, by
                    whom he had been briefed. Rogers, at 34, had served in administrative jobs in
                    Bush's White House and the Treasury Department. Without foreign affairs
                    experience or serious acquaintance with the Department of State's functions, his
                    loyalties were to Secretary Baker, under whom he had served in the White House,
                    and to Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Margaret Tutweiler, Baker's
                    principal personal aide. His brief was to protect Baker from anything in the
                    State Department that might cause public embarrassment in areas of ethics and
                    management, and this he did well. John felt ill at ease in his role, mistrustful
                    of the institution and its more experienced people, and soon developed a
                    reputation for autocratic behavior that made him, for many, difficult to
                    approach and engage, and in the end a remote figure at the top.</p>
                <p>As soon as he was confirmed, Rogers tried to subsume FSI under the director
                    general. This was once again blocked by congress for the same reasons. All of
                    this was going on while we were struggling to build the campus, which was
                    further along when Rogers became under secretary. Rogers went to the campus site
                    once, briefly, during my tenure to make sure the director's office was not too
                    large, and thus a potential embarrassment to Baker. It wasn't. Rogers abolished
                    the Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs, ostensibly for financial reasons,
                    but also because he did not consider its work appropriate or relevant.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>The Center's activities were designed to enhance the Department's capabilities
                    and engage the general public. It staged policy gaming exercises patterned after
                    the Defense Department's war games, sometimes highly classified, at other times
                    unclassified, so FSI could include academics, think tankers, journalists, and
                    business people to address specific foreign policy issues and the possibilities
                    of preventive diplomacy. It conducted seminars on policy issues open to the
                    public as a means to inform and build consensus. It also provided a home for a
                    small number of officers, usually between assignments, who could then work on
                    individual projects such as writing a book or running a series of seminars.
                    Ambassador Howard Schaffer, for example, wrote his excellent biography of
                    Chester Bowles there. The Center was a modest but worthwhile operation, having
                    been led by people of such evident talent as Hans Binnendijk, Michael Vlahos,
                    and Dennis Kux.</p>
                <p>John Rogers eventually reached a more thoughtful assessment of FSI's role. He
                    came to understand the relationship between training and achieving the
                    Department's objectives. In a meeting with senior FSI staff shortly before he
                    resigned, he said that to subsume FSI under the director general would have been
                    a mistake. He had listened too closely to Selin on this issue, he admitted. By
                    then I had left, categorically excluded by Rogers, as before, from management's
                    meetings and decisions regarding training.</p>
                <p>By far the biggest problem for us at FSI during the Bush administration was
                    opposition by the under secretary for management and the director general's
                    office to the construction of the training facility. Each year, the State
                    Department had to obtain appropriations for the project. This gave opponents at
                    State opportunities to shoot it down. Twice, we all but lost the funding, once
                    in 1989 and again in 1991, both times during Ivan Selin's tenure. John Rogers
                    also expressed to me his reservations about the campus and regret that it could
                    not be stopped. One key to eventual success was that funds appropriated for
                    construction were not fungible. They could not be used for other purposes. These
                    funds either would have to be spent for construction or would be withdrawn.</p>
                <p>The second time we nearly lost our funding, in 1991, seemed a fatal blow. I
                    attended a budget meeting in Selin's office during which he announced that the
                    Department's request for funding the training center would be dropped, despite
                    arguments to the contrary from Admiral Fort, whose administrative bureau was
                    responsible for construction, and myself. The matter was decided. He would
                    shortly be going to a budget meeting in Deputy Secretary Lawrence Eagleburger's
                    suite to which I was not invited. I left Selin's office completely discouraged.
                    There would be no chance for me to make FSI's case to Eagleburger because I
                    would not be attending the meeting. The dream of Arlington Hall was over, and it
                    was the State Department, not OMB or congress, that was ending it.</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>I walked down the hall to Larry's office and asked his secretary for stationery
                    and an envelope. Seated in the deputy secretary's empty conference room, which I
                    had first come to know thirty years earlier as a junior staff assistant to
                    Chester Bowles, I wrote a note to Larry saying that something immensely
                    important to the Foreign Service was about to be decided in his budget meeting.
                    If we did not take advantage of our present opportunity at Arlington Hall, we
                    would never find a comparable site, or get money from congress. By surrendering
                    our funding request, we would deny the Foreign Service much of the training a
                    new world situation demanded. A supportive congress would be annoyed. I put my
                    note in the envelope and asked his secretary to take it in to him. I never heard
                    a word from Eagleburger, but the funding remained in place.</p>
                <p>The story of the new campus has a happy ending. When I left FSI in 1994,
                    construction was 90% completed, nearly four years after George Shultz had
                    drilled the first test hole. It is now a thriving facility, and I find it
                    immensely satisfying, even thrilling, to watch students walk through the glass
                    connecting passageways to their classrooms. The National Foreign Affairs
                    Training Center is one of the great domestic accomplishments of the State
                    Department, and I feel privileged to have had a role in its creation. How rare
                    it is to leave something behind in bricks and mortar!</p>
                <p>G For Training to Succeed</p>
                <p>Here are the two most intractable problems in the effort to provide proper
                    training in the Department of State.</p>
                <p>First, except for rare leaders like Secretary Shultz, there is little support and
                    often disregard for training by the Department's senior managers. An ethic in
                    the State Department validates the avoidance of training because there are
                    always “more important” things to do. These matters are called “substantive.”
                    Training, moreover, is not in the present scheme of things seen as career
                    enhancing. Long-term training, as in the Senior Seminar and advanced economics
                    program, is too often viewed as taking up valuable time that could be spent on
                    activities thought to be judged more favorably by promotion boards who are, in
                    fact, supportive of training assignments and reward them.</p>
                <p>Second, training too often is not linked to the assignment process. I would like
                    to see specific training requirements mandated for every job in the Department's
                    civil and foreign services as prerequisites to be met by anyone filling a given
                    position. Only if training requirements are established for each job, and
                    insisted upon by personnel managers, will the State Department change its
                    culture and place training in its proper place in career development. When a
                    position description shows up on Personnel's computers, the training courses
                    needed should appear alongside and be required. No work in the Department can be
                    considered too unimportant to require training, and employees need training
                    throughout their careers as their assignments and responsibilities progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>H Diplomat-in-Residence at Georgetown University</p>
                <p>Irked, apparently, that the Foreign Service Institute had not been put under his
                    authority, but was kept separate by congress from Personnel's jurisdiction,
                    Director General Perkins made no serious effort to propose me for another
                    ambassadorship. I would be “on the list” for India, he vaguely told me. At the
                    end of my four years at FSI as the two of us discussed my future, Perkins
                    candidly suggested I find a job I would enjoy, offering no help from the
                    personnel system. I got in touch with Georgetown University to make arrangements
                    with its dean of the School of Foreign Service, Peter Krogh, to become a
                    diplomat-in-residence.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this program is to make available to students and faculty an
                    experienced person in foreign affairs as teacher and counselor. A
                    diplomat-in-residence is available to teach courses and advise students, and is
                    expected to stimulate interest in the Foreign Service as a career. I began to
                    develop a course on the challenges to American foreign policy and diplomacy at
                    the end of the Cold War, and became engrossed in this task. As it turned out,
                    however, I was to be at Georgetown for only four months.</p>
                <p>20DIRECTOR, SOMALIA TASK FORCE: 1992-93</p>
                <p>On the afternoon of November 18, 1992, while at my Georgetown University office
                    where I was a diplomat-in-residence at the School of Foreign Service, I received
                    a call from Frank Wisner, then under secretary of state for security assistance,
                    science and technology. I had worked with Frank when he was a deputy assistant
                    secretary in the African Bureau and I was in Zaire. Frank wanted to know whether
                    I would be interested in serving as the president's special envoy to Somalia to
                    replace Peter de Vos, who had just completed a year in that function. I said I
                    would be. This was at the time Somalia was falling apart through starvation and
                    the chaos created by warring factions at each other's throats. It was a
                    situation disturbing to us, the UN, and the world at large.</p>
                <p>A Somalia Background</p>
                <p>Having crammed in all the briefings I could, I was prepared to leave for Somalia
                    on a particular Monday. The preceding Friday, Acting Secretary Eagleburger
                    decided that Robert Oakley, a retired foreign service officer and former
                    ambassador to Somalia, should become the envoy. General Colin Powell, chairman
                    of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, knew Oakley well and had suggested him for the job
                    in light of Bob's previous experience in Somalia as ambassador and his
                    extraordinary range of contacts within the US government, both at the NSC, where
                    they had served together, and in the Pentagon. He was the best possible
                    choice.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>I was asked, instead, to head up the task force in Washington that would support
                    Bob in Somalia as he tried to get the leading factions to come to the table and
                    permit food relief supplies to flow unhindered. I was to report to Wisner, a
                    stipulation Frank and I established at the outset. We recognized that if I were
                    to coordinate a famine relief program at policy levels, I would need to be
                    speaking for an under secretary since it was the bureaus, headed by assistant
                    secretaries, that would need to be coordinated. These bureaus would at one time
                    or another have opposing views, as would other agencies, especially Defense.</p>
                <p>At Frank's Kalorama home over drinks, Frank, Bob Oakley and I put together our
                    instructions, aided by assistant secretary for African Affairs Herman Cohen.
                    This document laid out a charter for Bob and me: it spelled out what each of us
                    was expected to do, and what our formal lines of authority would be. It was
                    later distributed over Frank's signature to the relevant offices in the
                    Department. I say “formal lines of authority” because Oakley's bureaucratic
                    style was, as always, free form and wide-ranging. It could become exasperating
                    at times, but turned out to be essential in this crisis. Without Oakley's
                    creative and unbureaucratic ways, the relief operation would have been much more
                    difficult to accomplish and would not have succeeded so well, so quickly.</p>
                <p>The Cold War was over, and we were no longer competing with the Soviet Union for
                    bases and influence in this strategically located country on the Indian Ocean.
                    An insurgency early in 1991 toppled the government of Siad Barr�. US Gulf War
                    helicopters rescued the staff of the American embassy from its rooftop. The
                    provision of arms by both sides during the Cold War left clan leaders an arsenal
                    from which to help themselves as they fought each other and prevented emergency
                    food supplies from reaching their destinations. The US took the initiative in
                    Somalia, and we could therefore prepare our actions in advance. By late 1992,
                    Somalia's government had collapsed. It didn't exist. There had been 500,000
                    starvation deaths already and people were dying at the rate of 10,000 a day. The
                    media's graphic coverage of scenes of starvation made the famine in Somalia
                    understandable to a world-wide audience. We had reached the point in our
                    involvement through the UN at which the existing international relief efforts,
                    like Somalia's government, had also collapsed.</p>
                <p>Five hundred UN-Pakistani troops at Mogadishu's airport were helpless and pinned
                    down by forces of the local clan leaders. It was obvious the situation required
                    greater relief efforts, bolstered by serious military support to permit
                    deliveries and end pillaging. These efforts could only take place through US
                    leadership and would need the president's agreement. The strongest course of
                    action would require US military involvement under overall UN auspices. In light
                    of the magnitude of our prospective immersion in Somalia's humanitarian relief,
                    it made sense to set up a task force in the State Department to establish a
                    policy framework and coordinate operations.</p>
                <p>B Setting Up a Task Force</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>Task forces are needed as ad hoc and temporary mechanisms to manage problems or
                    explore issues outside the normal flow of business. They routinely deal with
                    emergencies or operations of unusual scale. Coordinating Gulf War policy engaged
                    a huge interagency task force in the State Department for more than a year. The
                    Jonestown suicides in Guyana, overseas plane crashes with many Americans on
                    board, an earthquake in Mexico City, a mob's attack on our embassy in Pakistan,
                    are all events that cannot be managed according to lines of authority on
                    organizational charts. They cut across many areas of responsibility and no one,
                    except at the top, has a mandate to direct the overall effort, in which State
                    has the leading role.</p>
                <p>Authorities and responsibilities of various bureaus and agencies, many of them
                    determined by law and regulation, are brought to bear by representatives who sit
                    around a long conference table in one of the task force suites of State's
                    Operations Center on the seventh floor, where sophisticated communications
                    systems are available to them. Often they have not known each other before, and
                    the task force director must begin immediately to build a team by defining
                    objectives, procedures and responsibilities. Secure phones and fax machines keep
                    members in touch with their bosses in Washington and with the rest of the world.
                    Maps of many scales are taped to the walls. CNN runs silently on the overhead TV
                    until it focuses on the emergency at hand, when all stop working to listen to
                    what is new and how events are being covered, or what the White House and
                    Defense Department spokespeople are saying. In a disaster, task force members
                    with consular experience receive phone calls, often frantic, from families
                    inquiring about relatives. They are trained in the painful ways, requiring
                    extraordinary sensitivity, of conveying tragic news or the lack of news. The
                    strain on these people, who are anything but unsympathetic bureaucrats, is
                    enormous. Sometimes they break down in tears after a string of such calls, and
                    need to be rotated to restore their perspectives and composure.</p>
                <p>In the task force suite, plastic status boards record information, time lines,
                    pending items, phone numbers, and endless check lists. People quietly talk into
                    their phones, draft telegrams and write situation reports. Someone keeps the
                    status boards current. There are long hours of boredom when nothing seems to be
                    happening. Around the table people catch up on work, read newspapers, chat,
                    doze, eat food that is not permitted in the area, or stare at the television
                    set. And suddenly, something unexpected. Oakley is on the phone from Mogadishu.
                    A Marine jeep has hit a road mine and there are casualties. The task force snaps
                    back to life.</p>
                <p>I put together a task force of about 12 people who would work around the clock in
                    three shifts, and was given latitude in picking its State Department members.
                    They were people who had other, regular assignments but who, for the duration of
                    the task force, were loaned to us. Many enjoy task force assignments as an
                    intense experience in learning and doing, a change in routine, and the prospect
                    of having solid performance rewarded by a letter of commendation in their
                    promotion files. I started with the selection of a full-time deputy, Ambassador
                    David Shinn, a broadly experienced officer with extensive knowledge of the Horn
                    of Africa who is an excellent manager. He was one of the principal authors of
                    the insightful (but ignored) “State 2000” report, which addressed the functions
                    and management issues of the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>That was the smartest decision I made. It freed me to think about the larger
                    problems of our work, lead our negotiations with the UN, and be a sort of
                    super-coordinator. David had just finished his work on “State 2000,” and I had
                    been pulled out of Georgetown University. We had no bureau roots or conflicting
                    loyalties. In an innovation, we recalled three retired FSO's with expert
                    knowledge of East Africa to be permanent shift coordinators, presiding over the
                    task force table as team leaders for each 8-hour shift. They became known as the
                    experienced and reliable coordinators of our work who would head their shifts at
                    the same times each day or night. Their foreign service backgrounds were
                    invaluable. We gave our coordinators authority to react quickly and truly serve
                    as issue managers. We obtained an extremely capable senior foreign service
                    secretary, Elka Hortoland, as the task force's administrative assistant. We
                    found that working secretaries in shifts without a permanent supervisor was
                    hopeless, because information was not passed on from one to the other and their
                    level of skills was uneven.</p>
                <p>We harnessed the needs of “tasking” assignments to bureaus and other agencies,
                    such as Defense and AID, into a process managed by Stuart Jones, a sharp and
                    persistent officer borrowed from the Secretariat staff, whose day-long job was
                    to ride herd on these assignments and our other deadlines. We rarely initiated
                    memoranda or wrote cables ourselves, but focused instead on crisis management.
                    Highly particularized knowledge and information, whether about the Horn of
                    Africa, UN resolutions, military airlifts, or humanitarian food relief uniquely
                    resides in the bureaus. Only they have the experience, time, regional outlook
                    and resources to pick up an intricate problem like Somalia and provide it their
                    specialized and essential attention. If one thinks of the Somalia effort as a
                    pie cut in many wedges, the responsibility of the task force was to keep the
                    policy rim intact and the wedges in proper proportion to each other through
                    time.</p>
                <p>Task forces bring together people who have never before worked as a team, and
                    launching a task force has its own headaches. Initially, we experienced a
                    complete turnover in personnel with each new shift, and it was like starting all
                    over again every eight hours. Task force members were not sure what they were
                    supposed to do, or what records to leave of their actions and pending problems.
                    At first, some bureaus were not sending their good officers or secretaries
                    because they wanted to keep them on regular work. We got off to a bumpy
                    start.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>Members of a task force need to understand each other in human terms, as well as
                    in their bureaucratic relationships. As they get to know each other the mood
                    relaxes, trust builds, they help each other out, and tensions are broken by
                    humor. The pressures of work in windowless confinement create bonding that is
                    surprising in its intimacy and openness among people who barely know each other.
                    One's sense of real time gets blurred. People feel themselves on a common
                    journey during their shifts, sometimes staying around beyond the end for
                    companionship and the intrinsic interest of an unfolding drama. The best in
                    themselves and their skills often emerges effortlessly and generously. The task
                    force experience, I thought, is not unlike serving on a jury that deliberates a
                    long time. On Christmas Eve, I sat alone and uninterrupted, watching Jimmy
                    Stewart on television in “It's A Wonderful Life,” until David Shinn took the
                    next shift at 6:00 a.m.</p>
                <p>C Somalia Decision</p>
                <p>By November 18, 1992 a few days before I returned to the Department from
                    Georgetown, a memorandum had been written to Acting Secretary Eagleburger
                    describing the situation in Somalia as catastrophic. By this time, the US had
                    become the largest food donor for over a year, but clan leaders in Somalia were
                    blocking delivery of aid in defiance of the UN. The memo began with the
                    recommendation that the US continue on its course and that a supplemental
                    appropriation be requested to provide additional relief. There was a cautionary
                    note from the Bureau of International Organization Affairs (IO) about becoming
                    further engaged, because this might require commitment of US military forces. IO
                    argued that our national interests were not directly involved and the use of
                    force under these circumstances, even for humanitarian purposes, might set an
                    undesirable precedent.</p>
                <p>The majority view, however, was that we could not be idle while people were dying
                    in such large numbers. The UN needed to show it could act decisively in crises
                    of the post-Cold War world. There was no argument about our relationship with
                    the UN: we should not get in front of it, especially in dealing with political
                    problems in Somalia. At issue was the nature of US interests in becoming
                    involved in a massive humanitarian relief effort under the chaotic circumstances
                    prevailing in Somalia. On November 23, a memorandum to the National Security
                    Council was prepared for the president, offering several options for future US
                    involvement in Somalia's famine. This document raised, for the first time, the
                    question whether, if the US were to become militarily engaged in Somalia, it
                    would be under Articles VI or VII of the UN Charter. Article VI refers to
                    “peace-keeping,” a largely passive operation, while Article VII refers to “peace
                    making” which requires armed forces poised to act.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>I urged that we spell out specific exit criteria and strategies, should we become
                    militarily engaged. Once a secure environment was established for southern
                    Somalia, about 40% of the country, we would have done our job and could leave,
                    letting UN forces and other countries address the remaining problems, which were
                    mostly those of establishing political stability in Somalia. Options in the memo
                    ranged from merely providing airlift for humanitarian supplies—to creating a
                    US-led coalition of UN forces. We estimated that as many as 12,000 UN troops
                    would be needed.</p>
                <p>Our memorandum reached President Bush the day before Thanksgiving, an accident of
                    timing which in my view turned out to be important. The moral issue came into
                    focus during a traditional national celebration of bountiful family reunions,
                    while others starved. Its purpose is to give thanks, but the image is of Norman
                    Rockwell's dinner table. Depiction in the media of starvation in Somalia during
                    this weekend was graphic, as reporters underscored the contrasts. (We went into
                    Somalia because of television, and we got out of Somalia because of television.)
                    Yet, we did not expect that Bush, so late in his presidency, would pick the
                    strongest option in our memorandum: a military intervention for humanitarian
                    purposes by United Nations forces under US leadership. It would be called
                    “Operation Restore Hope.”</p>
                <p>Bush's decision was made after the 1992 elections, in which he was defeated by
                    Clinton. He had only a few weeks left in office, and had successfully brought
                    the Gulf War to an end. I thought he made the right decision. None of us at
                    State or Defense knew then that the president believed the Somalia operation
                    could be over by January 20, 1993, the end of his term. He hoped to end his
                    presidency with a foreign policy flourish by doing something that would set a
                    worthy precedent as the “new world order” emerged.</p>
                <p>We learned from the NSC staff that Bush had consulted with president-elect
                    Clinton, who agreed with his decision. Bush believed the operation could be
                    finished without saddling the Clinton administration with a military commitment
                    he had made. The reaction of just about everyone else was that this goal was
                    unrealistic. The Defense Department, which carried out the operation, did its
                    best to accommodate to the deadline, but it soon became clear that we could not
                    possibly achieve a secure environment for humanitarian relief in the southern
                    half of Somalia by January 20.</p>
                <p>On December 3, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 794, which established
                    UNITAF (United Task Force) as an Article VII operation, the charter article
                    which calls for the use of “all available means,” in this case to establish a
                    secure environment for delivery of humanitarian relief. It allows the
                    flexibility a commander in the field must have to conduct such an operation. By
                    December 9, the first UN forces had landed in Somalia under the command of
                    Lieutenant General Robert Johnston.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>As director of the Somalia Task Force, I also led the US negotiating delegation
                    to the UN, an unusual arrangement but one that ensured coordination. I flew to
                    New York with our team many times to talk with Kofi Annan, the Ghanaian
                    Under-Secretary-General for Peace-Keeping Operations. He would later succeed a
                    prickly Boutros-Ghali, whose frequent annoyance with US positions on Somalia was
                    public and unrestrained, as the new secretary-general. A wise and ever courteous
                    man who had both dignity and a warm presence, Kofi was deeply experienced in
                    United Nations diplomacy in the most difficult area of peacekeeping. Universally
                    respected, he was able to listen and reflect on what he heard. Maintaining his
                    side of the argument forcefully but in a soft voice, he was certain of his brief
                    and could adjust course without needing to seek further instructions. Kofi drops
                    his g's at the end of a word, asking, for example, “When shall we have our next
                    meeting'?” This engaging Ghanaian habit conveyed a certain warmth. I liked him
                    very much, but found it difficult to penetrate his controlled and polite
                    exterior, even his gentle sense of humor, to reach the less dispassionate and
                    more emotional man beneath.</p>
                <p>Kofi Annan understood the reasons behind Bush's January 20 deadline, which was
                    making our task more difficult and straining credibility. Far removed from the
                    realities of “Operation Restore Hope,” this deadline with its origins in
                    American politics soon became an embarrassment—or source of amusement—to
                    everyone at the UN involved with Somalia. Kofi and his fellow negotiator Marrack
                    “Mig” Goulding of the UK, the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and
                    an exceptionally talented diplomat in multilateral diplomacy, arranged several
                    large briefings for UN heads of delegation which permitted us to give political,
                    military, and humanitarian relief updates of the situation in Somalia, and
                    describe UN activities there in a lively way.</p>
                <p>This was my first experience in negotiating with United Nations representatives
                    in New York, and at times I felt uncomfortable. The United States, which does
                    not pay the dues it owes, is indeed the five hundred pound gorilla at the table.
                    In the Security Council, drafts of resolutions on Somalia written in the State
                    Department were pushed through by representatives of our mission in New York,
                    usually working behind the scenes and not disposed or authorized to
                    accommodate—even in minorways—the views of others, particularly those of our
                    allies whose support, except for the French, we seemed to take for granted.
                    French diplomacy reflects a singular passion for being alone of its kind.</p>
                <p>Riding roughshod over others to have our way seemed unnecessary, and while a
                    successful exercise in power, was costing us respect. Other delegations must
                    sometimes have viewed US representatives as driven by a single-minded desire to
                    please Washington, no matter what. At the same time, Washington was capable of
                    reversing gears and blaming the UN when things went awry, as the Clinton
                    administration and congress did in the second phase of the Somalia venture, a
                    failure largely of our own making under a Security Council resolution we had
                    drafted and then pushed through. I could not help believing there was a better
                    way to achieve our ends.</p>
                <p>D Ambassador Oakley's Role</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>A few days after Bush's decision, Robert Oakley departed as special presidential
                    envoy to Somalia with the broadest possible mandate. He was to deal with the
                    clan chiefs to obtain a secure environment for the imminent arrival of UN
                    forces, most of whom would be American, and of huge quantities of relief
                    supplies.</p>
                <p>As all who know Bob will attest, he is a blunt, outspoken, lean and lanky Texan
                    who is decisive, effective in relations with our military, and shrewd in his
                    understanding of the inner workings of bureaucracy. He is also an expert on
                    Somalia's leadership, political culture, and clan structure by virtue of his
                    service there during 1983-84 as ambassador. He was central to the success of our
                    mission.</p>
                <p>Bob was in constant personal danger. He visited clan leaders in Mogadishu and the
                    countryside to brief them on the UN operation and secure their peaceful
                    cooperation. Bob preceded UN forces as they moved into towns and villages in the
                    relief area, reassuring local leaders and the population that no harm would come
                    to them and thereby securing their support. As a result, there were no armed
                    skirmishes in the relief phase. UNITAF's few casualties were caused by land
                    mines. His personal courage is an illustration of what a committed foreign
                    service officer is prepared to do.</p>
                <p>Bob not only worked on the issues of safety for UN forces, but began to consider
                    what needed to be done to lay the foundation for a political solution to
                    Somalia's strife. He focused on restoring a local police force. His outreach was
                    wide: his network included elders, women, academics, jurists, athletes—anyone
                    who might have influence over some segment of the population. He wanted as many
                    Somalis as possible to understand the reasons for the UN presence, the role its
                    forces were to play, and how important the cooperation of the Somali people
                    would be to the outcome of relief efforts.</p>
                <p>E Task Force Operations</p>
                <p>All task forces face unique circumstances. We were in the extraordinary position
                    of being involved in a major military initiative decided upon by a lame duck
                    president who would be leaving office with the task unfinished despite his
                    ambitious deadline. Bush would be followed by someone new not only to the
                    Somalia operation, but to the conduct of foreign affairs generally. We
                    recognized it would take time to get Clinton's appointees confirmed, and there
                    would be a leadership vacuum. We were engaged in an unusual policy role in
                    humanitarian relief on a scale unparalleled since the end of the Cold War. We
                    also recognized we would face problems of coordination in a government that was
                    going through changes in leadership and pangs of transition in every other
                    foreign affairs agency, as well as the National Security Council staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>We decided to strengthen process and procedures. We held two large interagency
                    staff meetings in the State Department every week to bring together people
                    working on Somalia, brief them on the current state of affairs, and provide them
                    an opportunity to share their thoughts and complaints. We were in touch several
                    times each day with Mogadishu by telephone, usually with Bob Oakley or his
                    deputy John Hirsch. We knew in real time where Bob was, what he was doing, and
                    what we needed to do to back him up. He also learned from us (and his many other
                    sources) what Washington was planning and where the hangups were.</p>
                <p>We managed essential coordination during the transition through regular meetings
                    of the “core group” of the NSC staff. This group included representatives of
                    State, Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CIA and AID, and was headed by
                    Richard Clark, of the NSC staff, the most able crisis manager I know. We worked
                    under policy guidance from the under secretaries in the NSC's Deputies
                    Committee. The “core group” made day-to-day decisions using video conferencing;
                    my group took care of implementation by assigning specific tasks to various
                    parts of the Department and the other agencies. If the “core group” could not
                    agree on something, the issue would be raised to the NSC's Deputies Committee
                    which Admiral Jonathan Howe chaired. The National Security Council itself
                    discussed Somalia only once or twice during the period of my involvement.</p>
                <p>Clark and I talked each day, exchanging information and insuring that we were all
                    moving in the same direction. We also made decisions which State's task force
                    passed on to the Department and other agencies through our daily meetings. We
                    had a secure interagency fax linkup which we used frequently for the
                    transmission of classified documents. Crisis management thus remained centered
                    in the NSC, where the pivot point was Dick Clark and his “core group.”</p>
                <p>F Failure of UNOSOM II</p>
                <p>The humanitarian phase of the Somalia operation, and my involvement in it, ended
                    in May, 1993 with UN Security Council Resolution 814 by which UNOSOM II
                    succeeded the US-led UNITAF operation. The emphasis shifted from providing
                    secure conditions for delivery of humanitarian relief to peace enforcement and
                    nation-building, an enormous and qualitative change. US forces were to draw down
                    to about 3,800 from 25,000. Bob Oakley had left Somalia by this time and Clinton
                    appointed Admiral Jonathan Howe, deputy National Security adviser to Bush, as
                    the successor special envoy.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>One of the most important aspects of establishing a task force is to anticipate
                    the time when it will no longer be needed. Once the objective of a relatively
                    secure environment for delivery of relief supplies had been attained, I thought
                    State's African Bureau should pick up the residual task force functions and give
                    our efforts permanent leadership. Hank Cohen, still the assistant secretary for
                    African Affairs, was anxious that responsibility for Somalia be returned to his
                    bureau. At the end of March 1993, we disbanded the task force in the belief that
                    its crisis management functions were no longer required, and the regular
                    mechanisms of government would suffice. In his thanks, Eagleburger termed the
                    task force “a model of crisis operations in the future,” and its work
                    “superlative.”</p>
                <p>What we did not anticipate was that the new administration would loosen its grip
                    on the issue of Somalia, and at its highest levels fail to recognize how great
                    the changeover to UNOSOM II's mandate would be. Problems in Africa were not high
                    on the policy agendas of State's new leaders. I discussed Somalia twice briefly
                    with Peter Tarnoff, the under secretary for political affairs-designate. He was
                    to inherit Seventh Floor responsibility for the Horn of Africa. I met with
                    Secretary Warren Christopher once at the beginning of the administration during
                    a general review of our relationships with the UN. Madeleine Albright, our UN
                    ambassador-designate, attended this meeting. I had briefed her earlier, and she
                    recognized that the US had again made Somalia a major UN concern, and that
                    UNOSOM II would break new ground. Ambassador George Moose, the assistant
                    secretary for African affairs-designate, was not confirmed before our task force
                    disbanded and therefore could not play a significant role, but he sat in on the
                    meetings my deputy David Shinn and I had with Hank Cohen. Dick Clark provided
                    continuity at the NSC.</p>
                <p>As soon as UNSCR 814 was adopted the draw-down of American troops began, and with
                    that process underway, the level of interest of America's new leadership in
                    Somalia's problems continued to diminish. Yet the situation remained volatile.
                    There still was no government in Somalia. Conditions in the Somalian hinterland
                    had changed sufficiently to permit the achievement of our relief objectives, but
                    chaos ruled in Mogadishu. Clans continued to fight. The police force was not a
                    force. We were beginning to make the grave mistake of demonizing clan leader
                    Mohammed Farah Aideed as responsible for the UN's problems in Somalia, and
                    therefore our own. Personification of foreign policy issues can become
                    misleading and dangerous.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>In the political vacuums of Washington and Somalia, the situation deteriorated
                    rapidly as UNOSOM II began. Any new administration has its plate full of
                    pressing problems when it comes into power, and must promptly set priorities. It
                    faces major gaps in senior staffing, and new people must learn their briefs. The
                    State Department has no permanent under secretary to maintain continuity.
                    Somalia appeared to Clinton's people to be on a track to resolution. The
                    humanitarian phase of the operation was considered a success, a building bloc in
                    the new world order. There had been no American combat casualties. Sufficient
                    supplies were delivered where they were needed. Relief had been provided
                    throughout the designated zone, and it is fair to say that for many hope had
                    been restored. Hundreds of thousands of lives were saved. All of us who had
                    something to do with UNITAF felt a sense of worthwhile accomplishment.</p>
                <p>The mood was upbeat in the Spring of 1993. President Clinton welcomed home the
                    first contingent of our troops, and received them on the lawn of the White
                    House. The senior policy levels of government, however, were not sufficiently
                    engaged in looking at the remaining problems, or in contingency planning should
                    the situation deteriorate. No one worried much about Howe. He had the same free
                    hand, essentially, that Bob Oakley had been given during the earlier period. He
                    understood the issues from Washington's vantage point, although he knew
                    virtually nothing at first hand about Somalia. The situation was highly
                    unstable, but the US government was leaving UNOSOM II operations to the
                    bureaucracy. This phase required establishment of at least some institutions of
                    government and a civic action program in Somalia to provide stability. It may
                    well have been a task beyond the capacity of any nation or the UN to accomplish,
                    and the tragedy for us is that members of our armed forces lost their lives in
                    UNOSOM II trying to make it work.</p>
                <p>We had anticipated the requirement for modest efforts at nation-building and had
                    negotiated with the UN on how to proceed with UNOSOM II well before the change
                    to Clinton in Washington. The UN was wary of undertaking this task. Its major
                    criticisms of UNITAF were that UN forces, led by Americans, did not do enough to
                    disarm the various factions, and that we did not devote sufficient attention to
                    clearing Somalia of land mines—literally millions of them, mostly outside the
                    relief areas. Disarming Somalia would be like trying to take all of the guns out
                    of Texas. It was not feasible. How were we, in any case, to know where arms were
                    hidden? Somalia is a vast desert, an easy place to bury weapons and even
                    vehicles, which clan members regularly did.</p>
                <p>A further criticism within the UN was that UNITAF did not extend its mandate into
                    the rest of Somalia, particularly to the militant areas of the north. We were
                    not prepared to take that step. Our objectives focused on areas that needed
                    humanitarian relief; we would do no more than help a starving, largely
                    concentrated population. These differences were a continuing source of tension
                    and public friction between ourselves and the UN, much of it inspired by
                    Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, always a difficult man to deal with on Somalia.
                    The media, of course, enjoy few things more than covering a scrap.</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>The great danger for us was what the NSC called “mission creep,” a process
                    through which, by taking one incremental step after another, each with its own
                    persuasive rationale, the entire mission is altered without conscious decisions
                    having been made at each stage to change it. Commitments, responsibilities, and
                    consequences diverge increasingly from original intentions, and decision-makers
                    find themselves sucked into a new game. “Mission creep” did happen, helped
                    through lack of oversight by the new administration.</p>
                <p>I agree with Henry Kissinger when he argues that national interests—definable,
                    rational, and publically supported—should determine the conduct of foreign
                    policy. When new issues confront a president, such as those with an entirely
                    humanitarian cast as in Somalia, then new difficulties arise in the definition
                    of our national interests. Government-sponsored humanitarian relief, in contrast
                    to disaster relief, was not part of the Cold War lexicon following our post-war
                    efforts in Europe ending in 1950.</p>
                <p>The decision memorandum prepared for President Bush just before Thanksgiving of
                    1992, which stressed both humanitarian and moral national interests in
                    alleviating suffering in Somalia, was an innovation, an early step in redefining
                    US interests after the Cold War. Never before had we considered peace-time
                    humanitarian assistance on such a scale or under Article VII, which required a
                    significant US military component abroad prepared to fight for delivery. The
                    fact that Bush approved the option of using such force was a conscious expansion
                    of time-honored definitions of US national interests, and has created a
                    precedent which is bound to be invoked at some future time.</p>
                <p>President Bush's decisions eventually put the US ahead of the UN and other
                    governments in an institution-building effort in Somalia. I did not then
                    believe, nor do I now, that institution-building is a US capability. It was not
                    in Somalia, nor is it in Haiti. The results are not yet in on Bosnia. There are
                    worthy programs we can support through normal assistance channels and private,
                    non-governmental organizations. Foreign governments, even in partnership with
                    other organizations, have been unable to provide the long haul commitment,
                    presence, control, and especially resources that serious institution-building
                    requires. And who is to decide precisely what is best for other societies?</p>
                <p>An incident illustrates the cultural gaps between the Somalis and ourselves, and
                    what can be made of them. At Christmastime in 1992, some of our Marines, feeling
                    homesick, took it upon themselves in a friendly American way to teach Somali
                    children Christmas carols. Somalis are Muslims. This well meant effort was
                    painted by some Somalis, especially clan leaders, as a plot on the part of
                    foreigners to convert their children to Christianity and its cultural values. We
                    reined in our troops. In their cynical way, clan leaders were using this
                    incident for their own purposes. They knew the truth, but chose to keep their
                    followers aligned against American forces, some of whom they would later kill
                    and drag through the streets of Mogadishu.</p>
                <p>G Bureaucratic Aftermath</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>When our task force disbanded in March, 1993 David Shinn wrote a detailed
                    memorandum on “Lessons Learned” in our task force experiences. We thought a
                    careful record of what we had been through, especially in our early struggles to
                    manage the issue, would help our successors on future task forces. The memo
                    turned out to be about twenty pages long and contained many recommendations. We
                    gave it to the Executive Secretary, Marc Grossman, who expressed his
                    appreciation. Marc distributed our memo to each assistant secretary and
                    executive director in the Department. About six months later, I became
                    peripherally involved with another task force which had spent its first few days
                    reinventing the wheel and making the same costly mistakes. None of its members
                    had heard of, much less seen, our memorandum. This again describes the
                    deplorable lack of institutional memory at the State Department.</p>
                <p>21POLICY PLANNING STAFF: 1993-94</p>
                <p>After serving on the Somalia Task Force I was adrift and, at 64, a year away from
                    mandatory retirement from the Foreign Service. The Clinton administration was
                    newly in office and the appointment process moved slowly. I was encouraged by
                    the new director general to think in terms of another ambassadorship. It soon
                    became clear to me, however, that pressures after the Cold War to sharply reduce
                    senior ranks in the foreign service were having widespread effect. Much was
                    being done in haste to get the numbers down, never mind why or how.</p>
                <p>A The Policy Environment Under Christopher</p>
                <p>Samuel Lewis, the newly appointed director of the Policy Planning Staff (S/P)
                    brought back by Christopher from retirement after his service as ambassador to
                    Israel, invited me to join him as a senior adviser. I accepted the offer,
                    recognizing with pleasure that my first chief in the State Department had been
                    Sam Lewis, when both of us worked for under secretary Chester Bowles in the
                    Kennedy administration. Sam was thus to be my first and last boss in the State
                    Department. I find such circularity not unusual; a certain harmony seems at
                    work. The year, however, was largely wasted.</p>
                <p>Warren Christopher, Clinton's first secretary of state, previously served as
                    deputy secretary under Cyrus Vance in the Carter administration. I worked with
                    him then on such problems as Nicaragua during Somoza 's demise, and
                    implementation of the Panama Canal Treaties. The deputy secretary now was
                    Clifford Wharton, who had impressive business credentials but no State
                    Department experience, although his father had been a foreign service
                    ambassador. Anthony Lake was the NSC adviser. He had been a foreign service
                    officer who resigned in protest over Vietnam during the Kissinger period. In an
                    unprecedented situation, there was no foreign service officer in any of the
                    senior policy positions on the Department's Seventh Floor, although Peter
                    Tarnoff was a former FSO: for the first time, not one of the under secretaries
                    was a career person.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>When I discussed policy planning earlier in these reminiscences, I suggested
                    there were two broad ways planning staffs had been used since the days of George
                    Kennan. The first was to keep the staff focused on long-range issues and removed
                    from day-to-day affairs. The second was to involve the staff in daily
                    operations, with less concern for the larger patterns, its director becoming a
                    de facto special assistant to the secretary of state. Neither of these models
                    describes what Sam Lewis was trying to accomplish for Warren Christopher. He was
                    somewhere in between.</p>
                <p>A policy planning staff should be what the secretary and deputy secretary want it
                    to be. But in early 1993, neither Christopher nor Wharton seemed to know. They
                    found themselves in a post-Cold War era and had little discernible strategic
                    view of the US role in a greatly changed world. Lake made a major foreign policy
                    speech during which he offered “enlargement” as the Clinton administration's
                    answer to Kennan's policy of “containment” at the beginning of the Cold War, a
                    concept that never took hold and remained vague. Christopher had stressed that
                    he was skeptical of catch phrases and slogans meant to encapsulate strategic
                    views, and he never endorsed the idea of enlargement. He described himself as a
                    case lawyer. This disciplined approach is essential in treaty negotiations or in
                    securing the release of hostages in Iran, but case law is not what foreign
                    policy is usually about. A case by case approach works for an implementor of
                    policy, but is not, in my view at least, adequate for the political leadership
                    responsible for determining our nation's course in unexplored waters.</p>
                <p>In this situation, Sam found himself without a seriously interested audience on
                    the Seventh Floor. Christopher's early speeches were noteworthy for omitting
                    discussions of Somalia, Bosnia or Haiti, festering problem areas that were
                    deteriorating. Christopher stressed more generally defined yet worthy ambitions,
                    such as bringing democracy and free markets to newly emerging nations. In the
                    end, however, there was little meat on these bones. Original drafts of his
                    speeches came from S/P, but were changed beyond recognition before they were
                    delivered. This should have been a time for serious and inspired planning.</p>
                <p>B Preventive Diplomacy</p>
                <p>Sam asked me to focus on “preventive diplomacy,” a concept in which potential
                    problems are anticipated and dealt with before, as George Shultz puts it “they
                    beat you over the head.” Lip service was paid to this technique at the beginning
                    of the Clinton administration, without its being spelled out. It had also become
                    a major theme of UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali in his agenda speeches,
                    where it was left equally undefined.</p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>In analyzing this idea, I concluded that the key elements of such diplomacy would
                    require: (1) early warning—we would need to know as soon as possible about an
                    emerging problem; (2) people in S/P and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    jointly to address problems while they were in their nascent stages, and work
                    with the relevant bureaus and embassies to resolve them before they grew; (3)
                    willingness to take action before a blow-up; (4) readiness to commit even
                    military resources in advance; and finally (5) the political will to act in the
                    face of public and congressional disinterest or skepticism.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to overstate the importance of political will. I thought the
                    first two steps were institutionally feasible; the other three problematic. We
                    should be able to become more sensitive abroad and at home to the possibilities
                    of preventive diplomacy. When an ambassador picks up the telephone to talk with
                    a foreign minister about an imminent problem and resolves it, this simple act
                    constitutes preventive diplomacy. The basic dilemma is when and how to intervene
                    in a situation that seems to be heating up, usually slowly.</p>
                <p>I have seen preventive diplomacy applied often. All of us as diplomats and in the
                    rest of our lives have done common sense things to head off potential problems.
                    On a grand scale, I cite global warming and population control as examples of
                    the need for worldwide preventive diplomacies with very long fuses. Preventive
                    diplomacy is a mind-set. To make it effective, people need to be disciplined to
                    think in its terms. All of our training programs at the Foreign Service
                    Institute, from the A-100 course for junior officers to the DCM and
                    ambassadorial seminars, should stress preventive diplomacy as a problem-solving
                    tool. Each of our posts should review bilateral relationships regularly to
                    identify sources of friction that could become major problems if left
                    unattended.</p>
                <p>C Lack of Interest in Policy Planning?</p>
                <p>Sam Lewis and I go back to my first Washington assignment and to service together
                    in Israel while he was ambassador and I consul general in Jerusalem, so it was
                    particularly sad to watch his mounting disappointment in his effectiveness as
                    director of S/P, a post Christopher had pressured him to take. Sam discovered
                    there was little interest on the Seventh Floor in long-term planning. Similarly,
                    he came to the conclusion that there was little regard for S/P's “devil's
                    advocate” role. There was scant curiosity in examining what had happened in
                    earlier administrations and how previous approaches and concepts had fared.
                    There may be an analogy between Sam's predicament and George Kennan's at the end
                    of his stewardship when that staff, under John Foster Dulles, was drifting into
                    irrelevance. The case by case approach to foreign policy Christopher practiced
                    makes it difficult for S/P as a whole to resonate; on operational matters the
                    expertise of the staff's individual members was often well used. When Sam was
                    succeeded by the relatively inexperienced James Steinberg, S/P slipped into the
                    model of a support staff to its highly active and ambitious director, who in
                    turn served the secretary effectively as a special assistant.</p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>During 1993-94, Sam was increasingly discouraged by S/P's inability to become a
                    vital player in the policy arena. He feared he might be hurting members of the
                    staff who were doing solid work as individuals, but whose output increasingly
                    met with indifference simply because it came from S/P. He had not been able to
                    achieve the close personal rapport with Christopher essential to a successful
                    Policy Planning Staff. Early in 1994, Sam Lewis retired for the second time.</p>
                <p>Having reached the age of 65 in April of 1994, I too retired from the Foreign
                    Service on the 35th anniversary, to the day, of my joining it.</p>
                <p>CONCLUDING THOUGHTS</p>
                <p>The Cold War framed my foreign service career. Nearly every significant foreign
                    policy question had a Cold War dimension needing to be accommodated in a bipolar
                    view of the world. This often reduced our flexibility, particularly in the Third
                    World where our blunt reactions to non-alignment and Soviet inclinations turned
                    us away from more sophisticated approaches which might have won friends,
                    destabilized opponents, and spurred economic and social development. The
                    American people were committed to winning this struggle and congress provided
                    ample resources to sustain it.</p>
                <p>As recently as the first term of the Reagan administration, we had a president
                    who denounced the USSR as an “evil empire,” to the satisfaction of most
                    Americans. In June of 1987, in a speech in Berlin, Reagan called on Gorbachev to
                    open up the Berlin wall. Diplomats shudder at such language, and try to keep it
                    out of speeches as grandstanding and needless provocation, but the fact is,
                    unrelated to Reagan's demand, that the Cold War disintegrated with a breach in
                    the Berlin wall on November 9, 1989. It was an event that I, who had lived for
                    six years in Berlin, never expected to see, although I was convinced it was just
                    a question of time. The division seemed that permanent, and the abilities of
                    both sides to stare each other down that unconstrained. Despite a blimp-sized
                    intelligence bureaucracy, our government had only a poor idea of the true extent
                    of economic collapse in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>We are unsure now of what new directions to take in our foreign policies, except
                    to continue along courses that make sense in the early stages of a post-Cold War
                    world. We have no single threat to oppose, and no overarching concept of what we
                    are about or even what shorthand label to affix to this era. Slowly, we perceive
                    that the US has become a more dependent variable in the equations of global
                    politics. “Wise men,” such as Acheson, Marshall, and Kennan have yet to emerge,
                    perhaps because of the murkiness of our times and absence of the terrible
                    tensions we lived with so long. The world does not stand still, however, and
                    there are others who are powerful and would seek to curb our preeminence, acting
                    either singly or by ganging up. We need to pay attention.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>Born in Arkansas in 1946, as the Cold War was beginning, Bill Clinton is our
                    first president to begin his term after the war ended and, except for Lyndon
                    Johnson, the first since FDR not to have experienced military service. The
                    Clinton presidency is one of transition in foreign policy. Global issues, with
                    their weighty economic and technological components, are still soft in concept
                    and clarity, and we continue to address them ad hoc.</p>
                <p>After both world wars Americans wanted to withdraw, to pull up the covers and
                    enjoy the comforts of isolation. For many of us, today's world seems
                    frustratingly complex, overwhelming and unsatisfactory. Perhaps we are in touch
                    with too much of it, all at once, through television, computers, and jumbo jets
                    that provide transportation but rob of us any sense of journeying.</p>
                <p>Drift in America's purposes abroad and the end of the Soviet threat have produced
                    severe cuts by congress in the international relations budget, amounting to a
                    reduction of fifty percent during 1984-97. The entire international relations
                    account adds up to 1.2% of the national budget. Yes, 1.2 percent. The State
                    Department's budget at $2.5 billion, is one and a quarter times the cost of a
                    single B-2 bomber. The national intelligence budget, at $26.6 billion, is more
                    than ten times greater. Among the 21 countries of the OECD who are the world's
                    major donors of foreign aid the US, proportionately, ranks last.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Service as an institution is in trouble. Today even its relevance is
                    questioned. Most people, including a majority in congress whose lives span only
                    the later years of the Cold War, understand little about its functions and are
                    quick to decide that in a shrunken world largely at peace consular work is
                    justified but the rest is marginal. Members and their staffs travel less often.
                    There is new belief in economic determinism, this time on a global scale.
                    Diplomacy is becoming a word out of the past, sliding into disuse unless there
                    is a threat to peace. Secretaries of State Baker and Christopher paid scant
                    attention to maintaining the vigor and professional well being of our diplomatic
                    arm, though each expressed his admiration for the career service upon
                    retirement.</p>
                <p>In 1924, the Rogers Act created a professional and admittedly elitist Foreign
                    Service, at the time, which capably managed our post-war responsibilities in
                    accustomed and leisurely ways, steering clear of entanglements and the
                    multilateralism of a League of Nations. The Second World War found in place a
                    virile and often brilliant crop of diplomats, informed about the Soviet Union
                    and China and ready to shape global and strategic views of US interests. As in
                    our army, where peacetime service was unexciting and not especially demanding,
                    the outbreak of war found in captains and majors some of the best minds and
                    commanders in our military history. Our armed forces and diplomats were ready
                    when we needed them. They must remain so.</p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>When we determined in 1946 to contain an aggressive peacetime enemy who promised
                    to be around for a long and deadly fight, we already had our wise men of
                    diplomacy and a military establishment armed with nuclear weapons. The Foreign
                    Service accommodated to these circumstances, and lived its glory days during the
                    Cold War. Now, we need both new policies and new kinds of diplomats. For what
                    lies ahead, we know the old ways of doing things are outworn. Our political
                    leaders, however, have not defined their international goals beyond the year
                    2000 with much clarity, or thought a great deal about the skills needed for
                    successful diplomacy in pursuing our national interests.</p>
                <p>Wars occur when diplomacy fails. This is the most telling argument in the need
                    for professional diplomats. Nearly all of our diplomacy is conducted by
                    professionals, who should, for America's sake, be the best our nation can
                    produce. It is odd to think of our Foreign Service as a potential Cold War
                    casualty. Secretary of State Albright understands diplomacy and history, and has
                    the qualities of character, commitment and experience to lead the Foreign
                    Service—not toward replication of the past, but to the thrilling prospects of a
                    post-Cold War world in which we will be living by our wits more than our might.
                    Success will not be handed to us.</p>
                <p>Recalling my boyhood years, I observed that living abroad gave me an unexpectedly
                    deeper appreciation of my own country, an ability to view it from a distance and
                    appreciate its shifting contours. As a diplomat, I spent my professional life
                    representing the United States and had an interest not only in what was
                    happening here, but also why, and what the trends were. Issues in American life
                    are not the subjects of these chapters, and there will always be serious issues.
                    Two, however, trouble me sufficiently to cite them here. These destructive
                    trends, more than even other failings, can erode the core of our society and
                    affect our vitality, cohesion, and international influence.</p>
                <p>The first is race, in which the strains between blacks and whites, in particular,
                    have continued in my lifetime despite enormous visible but too often superficial
                    progress. Finding a better way for racial groups to live together is our leading
                    social challenge. Second, while much that is good can be said about computers,
                    we are creating a distinction in our society so profound, between those who are
                    computer literate and those not, that the non-literate will be cast into a
                    permanent underclass. We must train all our children in these expensively
                    acquired skills. Access denied to Cyberworld is a form of social ostracism our
                    nation cannot tolerate.</p>
                <p>What then must the United States do to succeed in its foreign relations as the
                    Cold War recedes? Here are five shorthand answers that should also serve to
                    demystify what foreign policy and diplomacy are about.</p>
                <p>1 Get the policy right - This requires stronger leadership by the president and
                    secretary of state in devising and furthering policies based on our global
                    interests as the world's remaining superpower. 2 Put the secretary of state in
                    charge - Foreign affairs resources (the 150 International Account) should be
                    controlled by the secretary of state, and by our ambassadors at their posts
                    abroad, to provide policy direction and eliminate unacceptable waste and
                    inefficiencies. 3 Obtain the resources needed - Create close and effective
                    linkages between policy objectives and resources needed to conduct our foreign
                    relations, then fight to get the resources. 4 Train people to excel in their
                    work - Increased training at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center must
                    be funded and tailored to meet the requirements of each type of position and the
                    professional development of all who work in foreign affairs. 5 Recognize that
                    our foreign relations are not likely to end - Greater stability and continuity
                    in foreign affairs, and preservation of knowledge and experience over successive
                    administrations, can best be achieved by creating the permanent under secretary
                    of state position first called for by the Herter Commission in 1960, and the
                    “State 2000” report more than thirty years later.</p>

                <p>The horseback rider in Cormac McCarthy's tale of cowboys tells us, “the world
                    will never be the same.” Today only America, in its strength, exceptionalism,
                    and our cherished commonness, can lead the way to make it a happier world for
                    everyone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                        Training, let me thank you for a most enlightening oral history. We have
                        spent many hours on it, but I believe that it will be a very valuable
                        addition to our collection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GROVE: Tom, it is I who thank you.</p>
                <p>POSTSCRIPT</p>
                <p>I have referred to a certain “circularity,” or closing of circles of experience
                    and encounter, that sometimes happens in astonishing ways. For me this occurred
                    once more when I learned, after the transcript of my comments to Tom Stern, that
                    Marion Markle Henderson, now retired from the Foreign Service and living with
                    her husband Douglas in Weston, Massachusetts, would be working with me on
                    revisions to this oral history. We served together at the small consulate in
                    Abidjan, my first post. I had talked about her to Tom with fondness and the
                    admiration one feels for a truly first-rate Foreign Service colleague. Marion
                    has made working on my oral history a special pleasure. She is one of the people
                    to whom I have felt myself to be speaking. She has my heartfelt thanks for
                    everything in Abidjan and since then.</p>
