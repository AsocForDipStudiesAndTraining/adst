                <p>HENRY DEARBORN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 8, 1991</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your assignment to the Dominican Republic come
                        about and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I suppose from the spectacular point of view it was probably the most,
                    because relations were fast deteriorating with the Trujillo dictatorship with
                    which we had been playing along for about 30 years. Things had more or less
                    suddenly started to go into a tail spin. I was sent there as Deputy Chief of
                    Mission. The Ambassador had had my predecessor recalled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Joseph Farland. He didn't get along with his DCM so he had him
                    recalled. That was just about the time I was coming out of the War College and
                    they sent me there. I always remember Bill Snow was Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    for Latin America and he called me over to tell me where I was going when I came
                    out of the War College. He told me about this difficulty that had largely been
                    caused by my predecessor talking out of turn and saying things outside the
                    Embassy that the Ambassador didn't approve of. Bill said they had picked me for
                    several reasons, and one was that I “didn't talk much”. I always thought that
                    was very funny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am right now reading a book by a man who came a little
                        after you, Martin, called “Overtaken By Events.” I never focused much on the
                        Dominican Republic, but apparently the Trujillo regime was about as odious a
                        regime as you can have, and yet we were unhappy with a person like Peron who
                        was practically snow white when compared to Trujillo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Peron was in exile in the Dominican Republic, but he left just before I
                    got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain our relationship at the time you were
                        there in 1959, and what the situation was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: The situation over many years had been that the United States didn't
                    exactly approve of him, but he kept law and order, cleaned the place up, made it
                    sanitary, built public works and he didn't bother the United States. So that was
                    fine with us. About the time I got there his iniquities had gotten so bad that
                    there was a lot of pressure from various political groups, civil rights groups
                    and others, not only in the US but throughout the hemisphere, that something
                    just had to be done about this man. He had his torture chambers, he had his
                    political assassinations and he forced people to do things they didn't want to
                    do. He would take a business leader and say, “I want you to give a speech
                    praising me on such and such an occasion.” He would see a successful business
                    and demand a big cut out of it.</p>
                <p>All these things were mounting up and opposition to him was growing. There had
                    been a few attempts to assassinate him in the past, but they hadn't been
                    successful, obviously. There were three main props that held Trujillo in power:
                    one was the US, because we were semi-friendly and didn't do anything to get him
                    out; one was the Catholic church which took the long view and all he had to do
                    was build a few churches and be nice to the Church and they were willing to
                    tolerate him; and the other was the business community because he had always
                    kept law and order and cleaned up the country when it was previously a mess.</p>
                <p>But just before I got there, when Joe Farland got there, the business community
                    was fed up with the way they were treated. The Catholic Church felt that they
                    couldn't go along with this pariah any longer because it was giving them a bad
                    name. And the United States was feeling all this pressure from various sectors
                    at home and abroad to do something about the monster.</p>
                <p>His personal relations with the US became worse. He sent his son, Ramfis, up to
                    Leavenworth to the Army Staff College and he didn't take it too seriously. He
                    spent a good deal of his time off the West Coast with his yacht dating Kim Novak
                    and other actresses, etc. So when it came time for graduation they refused to
                    give him any kind of recognition. Ramfis had never been told no in his whole
                    life and was furious. Trujillo was furious and considered it a slight.</p>
                <p>Some of our ambassadors felt they had to get along with Trujillo. Joe Farland
                    took a different view. He started reporting all his iniquities—the torture
                    chamber, who had been killed and under what circumstances. Trujillo would take a
                    perfectly honorable person and write anonymous letters to the press questioning
                    his or her character. I remember one case of a lady doctor who he said was a
                    lesbian. Things like that...just mean. People were disappearing. People were
                    afraid to talk anywhere where people could listen to them. I remember one
                    reporter for US News and World Report came to town. He had been there a few days
                    and had a few unsavory experiences. He said to me one day, “You know, I spent
                    two years in Moscow, but I never really felt afraid 'til I got here.” He was
                    sitting in his hotel room one night with the door locked. The door opened and a
                    great monstrous man came in, stood there and looked at him and then without
                    saying a word turned around and walked out. They were trying to scare him into
                    not saying anything against the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Trujillo also had a few angels in the United States. There were southern Senators
                    who thought he was great. Some public figures went down there...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Senator Eastland was one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes from Mississippi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: He wasn't the only one. Not only Senators, but also business people who
                    he wanted to butter up. They would come back after being given the red carpet
                    treatment and say good things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we act at the Embassy? When these people came and
                        received the red carpet treatment, would we try to give them an accurate
                        picture of what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Sometimes they bypassed the Embassy and sometimes the favors done for
                    them were in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling when you were there that the
                        Embassy was turning around and really trying to tell it the way it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes, by the time I got there yes. Not while I was there, but just
                    before I got there. Farland was doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Farland and Trujillo get along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: They got along progressively worse the longer he stayed there. I have
                    forgotten when Farland arrived, but he had been there over a year, certainly,
                    when I got there. Trujillo had already begun to sense that Farland was talking
                    to the opposition, which, of course, was a no, no. There wasn't supposed to be
                    any opposition, but every once in awhile you could be caught talking to somebody
                    he didn't want you to talk to and you would hear about it. So relations were not
                    too good.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I arrived there the first of July, 1959, and that Fourth of July
                    party...(Trujillo had always been invited and when he came, for security
                    reasons, he would always require a separate room with one special person waiting
                    on him and him alone)...was the last time he was ever in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>The reporting to the Department became more and more oriented towards saying what
                    was wrong with things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given any feedback from the Department saying
                        Senator Eastland doesn't like this or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: No, we didn't have any pressure to moderate our reporting. But the
                    pressures from human rights and other groups on the Department and our
                    government had been such that the US government attitude was turning around by
                    that time. While Farland was still Ambassador there was a plan drawn up for
                    cooperation with the opposition and letting them know that if they succeeded in
                    overthrowing Trujillo, we would favor them. We called them the pro-US
                    opposition. Some of the opposition was living outside the country, the exiles.
                    Some of these were quite leftist and led by Juan Bosch and the Department wasn't
                    too happy about them taking power. This was a plan drawn up and approved back in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Farland was there until May 1960 when I became Charg�. In August we severed
                    diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic as a result of a meeting of
                    Foreign Ministers in San Jose, Costa Rica. All the American Republics voted to
                    sever diplomatic relations with Trujillo because of the pressure put on them by
                    Venezuela because Trujillo was caught red-handed trying to assassinate President
                    Betancourt of Venezuela. It was indisputable. His agents were caught. The
                    Venezuelans insisted that solidarity be shown on this. We were not averse to
                    that because we were pretty much put out by him ourselves by that time.</p>
                <p>Then, I think it was August 21, when diplomatic relations were broken, we
                    continued consular relations. So I switched to being Consul General. Three weeks
                    before the break I didn't even have an exequatur, but obtained one just in
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the permission to perform consular duties in a
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Knowing that we were going to break, but they didn't know, I sent over
                    asking for an exequatur for myself and the chief of the political section of the
                    Embassy and maybe one or two others. Once we broke there wouldn't have been
                    anybody to run the office. I wouldn't be there, the chief of the political
                    section wouldn't be there, the agencies would be gone. In two or three weeks I
                    received the exequaturs and within a couple of weeks we broke relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I always said this was the only time that I chose my own ambassador. There
                    weren't many left once all the Republics of the hemisphere broke relations. But
                    there were the British, Canadian, Chinese, Japanese, French, Italians—I think
                    only about ten embassies left. I recommended to the Department that they ask
                    London if the British Ambassador could represent us. He was one of the
                    no-nonsense about it types. My judgment at that time was proved correct because
                    he was great. The day...I told him we were going to break relations on such and
                    such a day...and on the day of the break he came over to the office, brought a
                    stack of British stationery and said, “All you have to do is write notes to the
                    Foreign Office just as you always do and send them over to me. I will sign
                    them.” He said, “Of course, you are going to have to learn to write in
                    English.”</p>
                <p>We didn't have many communications with the Foreign Office, but I did have a few
                    times when I needed to get something across, problems we had, etc. So he proved
                    to be great.</p>
                <p>A couple of weeks later a CIA message came from Washington (the CIA types had to
                    leave with all the rest) asking me if I would be willing to carry on the CIA
                    station chief job. Ambassador Farland had had contacts with the opposition and
                    had brought me in on them. Even the station chief did not deal with them. I was
                    the only one who could really carry on with them, because they were very
                    skittish having had bad experiences with American Embassy people in the past.
                    Things had gotten back to Trujillo, so they really didn't trust anybody. But
                    they had gotten to trust Farland and me. So I carried on the contacts with the
                    opposition reporting to CIA. We were using all these weird means of
                    communication because we didn't want to be seen with each other. Things like
                    notes in the bottom of the grocery bag, rolled up in cigars, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing with the opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: They were asking us for advice at times. They were asking us for help
                    at times. We didn't always give them what they wanted, but they knew that if
                    they got into power that we would be supporting them. They also kept being
                    hopeful that we might help them in more ways than we might be willing to. For
                    instance, they told us that they wanted to do this by themselves, but they
                    wanted our help.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>As time went on and Trujillo didn't collapse, they began to have more violent
                    ideas as to what they might do to him. Eventually they developed an
                    assassination plot which because of my close relationship with them I was fully
                    aware of. He was assassinated on May 30, 1961. I knew they were planning to do
                    it, I knew how they were planning to do it, I knew, more or less, who was
                    involved. Although I was always able to say that I personally did not know any
                    of the assassins, I knew those who were pulling the strings. I knew everything
                    except when. The only reason I didn't know when was because they didn't know
                    either. There had to be a certain set of circumstances when they could put their
                    plan into action. The last few days were rather hairy because I had told the
                    Department via CIA communications (I had a different typewriter on which I typed
                    out my messages to the opposition so that it wouldn't be traced to Embassy
                    typewriters) all about the plan. I recall a frantic message from the Department,
                    I guess signed off on by President Kennedy, saying, in effect, “Look, we have
                    all this trouble with Castro; we don't want any more trouble in the Caribbean.
                    Tell these people to knock it off.” So I communicated to the opposition people
                    that Washington was very much against any attempt at assassination. The answer I
                    got back from them was, “Just tell Washington it is none of their business. This
                    is our business. We have planned it and we are going to do it and there is
                    nothing you can do about it.” I relayed this to Washington. I am sure there were
                    some in Washington who were skeptical; that there was an alarmist down there in
                    the consulate.</p>
                <p>The night of May 30, 1961, the Chinese Ambassador was giving some kind of a money
                    raising thing at the country club for charity to which I went. We started back
                    around 11:00 and ran into a roadblock along the ocean highway. They were
                    stopping all cars and making everybody get out. They looked in trunks, pulled up
                    rugs, etc. I had a CIA fellow in the car (along about January the CIA had sent a
                    couple of people in to the consulate) and I said, “Bob, this is it. I am sure
                    this is it.” They wouldn't let us continue on that road, they sent us back along
                    another road into town. We got to the Embassy, where I had been living for about
                    a year, and the telephone rang and one of my main contacts of the opposition
                    said, “It is over, he is dead.” I knew immediately what happened and went down
                    to the office and sent off a message to Washington.</p>
                <p>A little later, maybe an hour or so, I had gone to bed, the phone rang and it was
                    a call from a girls school there run by American nuns. An American bishop (there
                    were six bishops in the Dominican Republic and one was an American), had gotten
                    in trouble with Trujillo who had threatened him in his bishopric up in San Juan
                    de la Haguana and for safety sake he was living in the girls school for a
                    time.Well the nuns called and said, “You know, Bishop Reilly has been kidnaped
                    from the school and we don't know where he is. We want you to come over right
                    away.” So I called the British Ambassador. I couldn't get through to him but got
                    his number two man, Bill Harding, and said, “Bill, will you please meet me over
                    at the school for girls.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I got over to the girls school and it was a mess. The nuns wore white cassocks
                    and there were little blood specks on them. I said, “What happen?” They said,
                    “About 15 of these thugs came in and started firing guns. We didn't get hit but
                    little specks of brick came off the wall and nicked our faces.” Then they took
                    us to the Bishop's room where the pet dog that the invaders had killed was lying
                    across the threshold. They had kidnaped the Bishop and taken him off to who
                    knows where.</p>
                <p>Then Bill Harding arrived and shortly after him British Ambassador McVittie. Then
                    one of the Dominican generals came. I described what had happened and explained
                    we didn't know where the Bishop was and we were concerned for his safety since
                    he was an American citizen. The General said he would go back and talk to the
                    President. We decided to look for further assistance.</p>
                <p>There wasn't a Papal Nuncio at the time, but there was a charg� d'affaires. I
                    said, “Let's go over to the Nuncioatura. Bishop Reilly is an American citizen,
                    but the Vatican should have an interest in this.” We roused the charg� Monsenor
                    del Guidici. He was no help. He was obviously scared. He was afraid of doing
                    anything that might get him in wrong with his bosses. The British Ambassador
                    wanted him to go over with him to the Foreign Minister—get him out of bed and
                    raise a ruckus. But Monsenor del Guidici said, “I don't think they will hurt the
                    Bishop, do you?” I said, “I think they would hurt the Bishop. They threw rocks
                    at him and threw him out of his rectory. It was just luck that one of those
                    rocks didn't kill him. I don't agree with you.” The British Ambassador rose to
                    the occasion and said , “If you don't want to go I will go by myself.”</p>
                <p>He went off to see the Foreign Minister. Bill Harding and I, probably about 4:00
                    by now, went back to the girls school and who should be sitting on the sofa in
                    the front hall but Bishop Reilly. He was the first one to tell me, after I had
                    gotten my initial message, that Trujillo had been assassinated. What had
                    happened to him was that his captors took him to the air force base outside the
                    city, San Isidro. Somehow President Balaguer, who was Trujillo's figurehead
                    president, heard about it and sent word out to the base to bring the Bishop to
                    see him. When he arrived, Balaguer said, “I'm terribly sorry about what happened
                    to you but you know the Generalissimo has been assassinated tonight and these
                    fellows through an excess of zeal thought that you might be involved in it
                    because the relations between you had been bad.” So I sent out a message about
                    Bishop Reilly. It was a wild night.</p>
                <p>It wasn't for another day or two that the general public knew that Trujillo had
                    been assassinated. They didn't give out the information right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the aftermath of the thing was terribly disorganized
                        wasn't it? In other words the opposition group didn't take advantage of
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: What happened was; Ramfis was in Europe. The minute he heard about it
                    he chartered a plane and flew back to the Dominican Republic. Balaguer was the
                    civil leader, but Ramfis was still head of the air force. The family was
                    definitely a group to be reckoned with. Balaguer wasn't completely independent
                    even now that Trujillo was dead.</p>
                <p>The assassins picked the time they did it because the circumstances were right.
                    They knew on some nights he went to visit his mother and after visiting her he
                    would get into a nondescript car and drive along the coastal highway to see his
                    mistress. He would do that completely unscheduled and didn't worry too much
                    about it because nobody knew in advance. But the opposition had a spy in the
                    garage who reported to them that this was the night. So they had two cars
                    mobilized. One got in front of his car and one got in back and they forced him
                    off the road. He had a gun but they overpowered him and killed him. That is how
                    it happened.</p>
                <p>Then they didn't know if at the time of the funeral whether the family or the
                    opposition might cause some problems. So I didn't dare go to the funeral because
                    I was afraid I would have to call in the Navy which was just over the
                    horizon—the biggest naval force since World War II was sitting just over the
                    horizon— and didn't want to go away from my communications. I sent the number
                    two man to the funeral. So there were all sorts of speculation as to why I
                    hadn't gone to the funeral.</p>
                <p>About a week later, I received a phone call one morning at 7:00 a.m. from Ted
                    Achilles who was with the Task Force in the Department. He said, “Henry, we want
                    you, your wife, and the children out of there on the noon plane. We think you
                    are in danger,” the concern being that Ramfis and his group had killed all the
                    assassins except for two and was unpredictable. So I said, “There is no noon
                    plane but there is a plane to Puerto Rico at 2:00 and I could get on that, I
                    guess.” We were living in the Embassy and our pictures were on the wall and our
                    clothes were in the closets and drawers. I said to my wife, “Look, you take the
                    house and I will take the office and we will do the best we can.” So my wife
                    went through the house with another wife who was still at the post. She went
                    from room to room and put everything that belonged to us in the middle of the
                    floor. I went to the office where we were pretty streamlined by that time. We
                    even had our secret files in a burn barrel ready to burn up because we didn't
                    know what was going to happen. About a month before that we had gone through
                    everything and shipped back to Washington everything that we didn't absolutely
                    need, because we just didn't know what might happen—we didn't have diplomatic
                    immunity anymore. Trujillo was good at staging things and could have staged a
                    raid on the Consulate General and disclaimed any knowledge of it.</p>
                <p>I called the British Ambassador and said, “You know I wouldn't ask you to do this
                    unless it was extremely urgent, but could you come over to the house.” He came
                    over and I told him everything that was happening and that I was leaving at
                    2:00.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The Admin officer, who was still there was going...(we had already loose packed
                    most of our furniture when we moved into the Embassy because we didn't need it
                    and stored it in the garage)...to pack up the other things lying in the middle
                    of the floors and send them to Bogota, our next post. It was the best move we
                    ever had. We didn't miss a single thing. The only mistake was that I got an
                    Embassy lamp.</p>
                <p>A funny incident, Evelyn Cotterman who was the Admin. Officer's wife, was helping
                    us around the bedrooms. I had my shirt, tie, shoes and socks on but couldn't
                    find my pants. I said, “Evelyn where are my pants?” She said, “Oh, my god, I
                    packed them.” They had to go back down to the car outside and unpack my pants so
                    that I could leave the country with dignity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Ramfis took over...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: He didn't really take over. Let me clear up the relationship there. The
                    day before I got this phone call to leave, I went over to the Palace to talk
                    with President Balaguer on instructions from the Department. I said, “I am sure
                    you know, because of your air force observers, that we have a very large naval
                    force just over the horizon and we want you to know that if you feel you need
                    help we will give it to you.” His answer, in effect was, “I have had a talk with
                    Ramfis and he has agreed to respect the civilian authority and as long as I
                    don't have any reason to think he won't, I don't think I ought to do anything
                    like you are suggesting.” I also took the occasion to tell him that the way that
                    some respectable citizens of his Dominican Republic were being treated was not
                    making a very good impression abroad and was hurting his government. That was
                    the last time that I saw him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there Ramfis ran wild didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: That is true but I never saw anything of Ramfis. He was a playboy. He
                    was out of the country a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am talking about after his father's death, but you
                        weren't there very long were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: A week. Trujillo was killed the 30th of May and I left the 5th of
                    June.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: No, they took a fellow out of the War College, named John Calvin Hill,
                    and sent him down as Consul General, until Ambassador Martin came. I think they
                    didn't get along too well, and Hill went as DCM to Venezuela. Hill had a very
                    interesting time of it before Martin arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and the Embassy and later on you and the
                        Consulate General view Castro? He was just coming to power at this time and
                        this was sort of a cataclysmic event and it was your next door neighbor. If
                        we were getting nervous, what was happening in the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Trujillo used this. He was getting angry with us and in order to bother
                    us and maybe change our minds about him, he was threatening to be chummy with
                    the communists, which was ridiculous. But he sort of waved this in our faces—if
                    you don't like me I will go over to Castro. Of course Castro had no desire to
                    get in with Trujillo, so from that side there wasn't anything. But Trujillo was
                    making all these motions to join hostile forces against us with anyone he could
                    find. And with some success. It did bother Washington. It also added fuel to the
                    degeneration of relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennedy came in in January, 1961. Joseph Kennedy had
                        connections everywhere, did you have the feeling that he had connections
                        with the Trujillo government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: No, I didn't. Joseph Kennedy's name didn't crop up in the Embassy. The
                    one that did crop up was a fellow who had been a trouble shooting ambassador of
                    ours—I think he had been with the Flying Tigers—William Pawley. He was a
                    nuisance. He had a brother who was in charge of their family interests in the
                    Dominican Republic and they had been cozy with Trujillo. One thing that happened
                    was that I had a message (Feb, '61) that Senator Smathers (Florida) was coming
                    to the Dominican Republic and wanted to talk with Generalissimo Trujillo about
                    our relationship, etc. He wanted me to go with him to see Trujillo— the last
                    thing I had any desire to do.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he came and just as he came Bill Pawley arrived. Of course, Bill had
                    every interest in seeing that things went well with Trujillo. Smathers took me
                    aside and said, “You know, Bill Pawley is arriving too, but when I see Trujillo
                    I do not want him with us.” So then Bill Pawley joined the group and said,
                    calling Smathers by his first name, “Now, when you go to see Trujillo I want to
                    go with you.” Smathers couldn't get out of it by that time. He didn't want to
                    say no to Pawley I guess because Pawley had influence in Florida.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>In addition, Pawley had Bebe Rebozo, a friend of Nixon's in Florida, with him. So
                    Senator Smathers, Bill Pawley and Beebe Rebozo and I all went to see Trujillo.
                    Smathers gave him this talk. He said, “Generalissimo you have the opportunity to
                    be a great hero in this hemisphere. You have the opportunity to be one of the
                    few dictators, one of the only dictators, who was ever able to turn his country
                    into a democracy during his lifetime. If you would do that you would really be a
                    hero to your people and to the hemisphere.” I sat there thinking, “Oh lord, you
                    don't know who you are talking to.” Trujillo said just what I could have written
                    as his script, “Senator, I don't know what you are talking about. I am just a
                    citizen in this country. I don't have any public office. We have a president, an
                    executive, a legislature, a supreme court just like your country. I really don't
                    know what you are talking about.” So Smathers didn't get anywhere with it.That
                    was one of my more interesting moments. Hector Trujillo, a brother, was
                    figurehead President and was present at the interview.</p>
                <p>Then Trujillo did a funny thing. He had a custom that every once in a while he
                    would have a mass baptism. He was about to have one and he wanted the Senator to
                    come and see it. Trujillo would be godfather to all these little kids. So we
                    went into the Palace chapel. Of course, pictures were everything. What Trujillo
                    wanted was a picture of himself and the babies and Senator Smathers. I was
                    standing next to the Senator and just when he was to snap the picture I would
                    step back and get behind the Senator so I wouldn't get myself in it. The Senator
                    would pull my arm and say, “Come on, get in the picture.” So I would step back
                    next to him and just as the picture was to be taken again I would step back
                    behind the Senator again. When the picture came out, I think it was in the New
                    York Times or local paper, I was not in evidence. Thirty years later I saw that
                    one of the pictures not earlier published did have a piece of my head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last thing about the Dominican Republic, you were
                        mentioning about the Bishop and the Papal Nuncio and about some papers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes, that was very important. Before I moved into the Embassy and
                    Ambassador Farland was still there, a new Papal Nuncio arrived. He was a
                    commanding figure. He was regal— tall, a man about 50 years old. The previous
                    Nuncio had been a little old, nondescript man who never caused any problems.
                    This Nuncio got off on the wrong foot. He hadn't been there long and they were
                    about to inaugurate a new international airport. So the Foreign Office sent a
                    message over to the Nuncio that they would like to have him give an address at
                    the inauguration. He said, “I don't think that is exactly the proper job for a
                    Papal Nuncio.” However they put some pressure on him and he said, “Well, all
                    right I will say something.” They said, “Well, please submit what you are going
                    to say before you do it.” Well he didn't like that very much either, but finally
                    he did. They came back saying they wanted him to put in something about the
                    glories of the Generalissimo, etc. The Nuncio refused saying that was not his
                    role. So he didn't get off on the right foot.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>As time went on the bishops (I really don't know how much the Papal Nuncio
                    inspired it and how much the horrors of the Generalissimo's activities alone
                    inspired it), a critical pastoral letter which they all signed. Not the Nuncio
                    but the six bishops. Trujillo blamed the Nuncio whether he was at fault or not.
                    One of the bishops, as I said, was an American, and one was a Spaniard; the
                    other four were Dominicans. This was anathema to Trujillo. No one had ever done
                    this before. The pastoral letter was criticizing him and was read in churches
                    all over the country. He was livid. This was another indication that relations
                    with the Church were on the decline.</p>
                <p>I became very friendly with the Papal Nuncio and I used to stop on the way to the
                    office after lunch and visit him almost every day. We would swap information. He
                    was a great source of information and I guess, for him, I was also. This was
                    noticed by Trujillo's all seeing secret service and radio news programs noted
                    that the Consul General and the Nuncio were becoming very friendly and that this
                    was a suspicious development.</p>
                <p>To show you what little tricks Trujillo used to do—I guess he wanted to scare the
                    Nuncio out of the country, or something. One day I received an invitation to a
                    reception at the Papal Nunciatura at noon on such and such a day. It was the day
                    Ambassador Farland was leaving, so I hadn't quite taken over. I was surprised
                    because I had seen the Nuncio the day before and he hadn't said anything to me
                    about a reception so I sent John Barfield over to find out what it was all
                    about. He came back and said, “There isn't any reception. These are fakes. The
                    Nuncio has never seen these invitations.”</p>
                <p>At the appointed hour the Generalissimo appeared at the Nunciatura gate and told
                    the gate person that he had come to the Nuncio's reception. The boy went back in
                    and told the Nuncio that the Generalissimo and several cabinet members were at
                    the gate and had come to the reception. The Nuncio said, “You go back and tell
                    the Generalissimo that if he wants to come in by himself I will be very glad to
                    talk to him but there is no reception here.” So the boy went back to the gate
                    and there was nobody there. This was the Generalissimo's way of harassing the
                    Nuncio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This regime was obviously an odious one. How about the
                        officers, you were DCM and responsible for running the Embassy and later on
                        the Consulate General, was it difficult working with your officers? Were
                        some of them taken in by the Trujillo largess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: By the time I was there the Ambassador had set the tone for the
                    relationship. There was one officer who had been there five years and he was on
                    quite good terms, which was good in a way because he was the Consul. Harry
                    Lofton was his name. Harry had a good working relationship with the police.
                    Harry was far right in his thinking and I would suppose Jesse Helms would be a
                    hero for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about what we would call today a right wing
                        conservative, a law and order person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes, that would have been Harry. On the whole he didn't cause problems,
                    but in the last days of the regime he did. He was making it difficult in staff
                    meetings. So when we were changing from Embassy to Consulate General I sent an
                    eyes only message to the Department recommending that in the shuffle, Harry,
                    having been there five years and not being in accord with the polices that were
                    being followed, should be moved to another post. Harry never forgave me for
                    that, but I thought five years was long enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a long time, particularly in a situation where one
                        can get too close, because this can also reflect...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: We had a very good group. John Barfield was chief of the political
                    section and he was excellent. Then we had Charlie Hodge as economic counselor
                    and he had a couple under him. Then we had a naval mission that was very good.
                    Then we had an attach� who represented the Defense Department, Ed Simmons, a
                    Marine Colonel who later became a General and is now in charge of the Marine
                    Library here in Washington. A very nice fellow. We had a very small AID program.
                    I think there was only one person, maybe two. There was an American school. We
                    had, of course, USIA. One of our USIA officers was declared persona non grata
                    because they said he was going around saying things against the Generalissimo.
                    In fact, I, myself, almost got caught because I was talking at the hotel to a
                    newspaperman whose name you would recognize if I could say it, who came
                    through...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Tad Schultz by any chance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: No, he was more in the ownership class. Tad Schultz is another story. I
                    kept him out of jail. (The man was Roy Howard, now I remember.)</p>
                <p>Anyway, they saw me talking to this newspaperman in the hotel and then they said
                    I had been telling him bad things about the Dominican Republic. I could see what
                    was coming and went right to the British Ambassador. I said, “Look this is what
                    they are saying and I don't know what game they are playing, but I absolutely
                    deny the whole thing. It is not true. It is true that I was talking with him,
                    but I didn't say anything to cause the Dominicans any embarrassment.” The
                    Ambassador picked up the ball right away and went over to the Foreign Office and
                    told them this. With the British Ambassador having taken this position they
                    decided not to follow through on it. I think by that time maybe they thought
                    they would like to get rid of me and were looking for a way to do it. I don't
                    know.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I would like to mention one more thing on the Dominican Republic. One day a
                    student came into my office scared to death. He said they were after him, they
                    were going to kill him, they were going to torture him. A great big fellow who
                    belonged to one of the best families. He was just scared out of his wits. I knew
                    what was going to happen. There was a secret movement among the students and
                    Trujillo was dying to get the names of all these people. If he could catch one
                    of them he could torture him and make him give the names of the others.</p>
                <p>So when I heard this, what I saw happening was this kid being taken out to the
                    torture chambers, being abused and maybe even killed and a whole bunch of kids
                    having the same thing happening to them. All I could think of was that this just
                    cannot happen. So I said, “Well, you can stay here.” I had a little bathroom off
                    the office and stuck him in there. It was terribly cramped and it was a hot box;
                    there was no air conditioning in the whole Embassy at that time. I said, “You
                    just stay in there until I think of what to do.” I think he was in there two
                    days. Nobody in the rest of the Embassy knew this, except John Barfield whose
                    office was on the other side of the bathroom from mine.</p>
                <p>For a couple of days I kept the boy in there, I brought him food down from the
                    house, still trying to think of what to do. Finally a fellow came in, Dan
                    Kirtley, who was the pilot of the naval mission plane. He was the last person of
                    what had been the Embassy to leave the country. He came in to say goodbye. I
                    suddenly had a bright thought and said, “Dan, would you be willing to undertake
                    a little skullduggery for your old friend here?” He said, “What would you want?”
                    Dan was always a man of action. I told him I had this fellow and described the
                    whole situation to him. I said, “He is either going to get tortured or killed
                    and a lot of other people too, and I just wonder if you on your last takeoff
                    from the Dominican Republic would take him with you.” He said, “You have him at
                    my plane at 2:00 and I will take him.”</p>
                <p>Well, there were nearly insurmountable obstacles between the office and the
                    airport: how to get him out of the office, for example. First I had to get him
                    up to the Residence. The office and the Residence were in the same block and
                    there was a long lawn and swimming pool between them. John Barfield said, “I can
                    back up the car to your office door and we can put him in the trunk.” I said,
                    “That is too obvious. Let's just walk up to the Embassy as though nothing is
                    wrong and maybe nobody will notice. If anyone does notice I will say it is Bill
                    Raft.” Bill was a Marine Guard who was the most like the young man in physical
                    appearance. So we did that.</p>
                <p>The garage of the Embassy was in the back. We took him out to the garage and then
                    I drove the car out. We got halfway down the driveway to the street and I said
                    to the boy, “I am going to open the trunk and you crawl in.” I was just opening
                    the trunk when the servants in the Embassy came out of the kitchen and saw
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So I said, “No, don't get in the trunk,” and I pulled down the lid. I said, “You
                    get in the front seat between John and me. Just sit there.” Of course I didn't
                    want them seeing me putting someone in the trunk. I said, “If they say anything
                    later I will tell them that we had a bet on to see if you could fit in the
                    trunk, or something.”</p>
                <p>At the end of the driveway there was the street and up on a hill looking over all
                    this was the national police station. Of course they weren't all up there
                    looking at us, but it was just another thing to think about it. So we got in and
                    started for the airport and this fellow grabbed a newspaper trying to hide
                    behind it. I told him to put it down and act natural. So we drove through town,
                    took the airport highway and about three quarters of the way to the airport on a
                    stretch where we could see both ways and nobody was coming I said, “Now you get
                    in the trunk.” So I put him in the trunk and we drove the rest of the way to the
                    airport.</p>
                <p>We drove over to where Dan Kirtley's plane was, which was apart from the other
                    planes. Dan said, “Is he there?” And I said, “Yes, he is in the trunk.” There
                    was a very low entrance to the plane so he said, “You back the car up to the
                    door.” Just as I was doing this, a Dominican who was hanging around the airport
                    and used to help Dan out with things appeared. I said, “Now what do we do?” Dan
                    began looking around the car and said to the Dominican, “Hey go back there and
                    get a pump, the Consul's car has a low tire and he can't drive around like
                    that.” So, with the Dominican sent back for a pump, I backed the car up to the
                    plane and the fellow crawled into the plane.</p>
                <p>There was a tower with air controllers there and I didn't know what they were
                    seeing or what they weren't seeing. But fortunately something happened that
                    hardly ever happened: three international flights, I think one taking off and
                    two coming in, were active all at the same time; and it started to rain. It was
                    just plain luck. I nervously watched while Dan took off for Puerto Rico with his
                    passenger.</p>
                <p>I went back to the office and sent off a message through my CIA channel which
                    started something like: I have probably broken every rule in the book, but...one
                    thing I knew was that I couldn't let them catch this fellow. I often wonder
                    where he is now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you, we will continue starting with you going
                        to Bogota.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the second interview with Henry Dearborn. Today is
                        May 8, 1991. You were mentioning that there were a couple of things that
                        happened concerning your time in the Dominican Republic that we might add on
                        now before we move on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes, one thing that occurred to me was when President Kennedy sent his
                    own emissary down to talk to Trujillo to try to persuade him to leave his
                    dictatorship, whether to leave the country or just leave power I am not sure. Of
                    course, I was in close contact with what we called the pro-US opposition and
                    they were very good sources for me. One day I had a message from them outraged
                    because they said they understood that Ambassador Robert Murphy had appeared in
                    the Dominican Republic secretly and had talked to Trujillo. How could it be that
                    I did not inform them of this? I went back and said that I very much doubted
                    that. I didn't believe that Robert Murphy had come officially without my knowing
                    it. They came back and said, “You are absolutely wrong, our sources tell us that
                    he is indeed here.”</p>
                <p>Of course, Robert Murphy was a retired Foreign Service officer of great
                    distinction. I was very indignant and sent off a pretty strong message to the
                    Department, the burden of which was that I couldn't doubt much longer that this
                    was true. A sort of “How could you do this to me?” message and “How could I be
                    expected to retain the confidence of these people, if I didn't let them in on
                    something of that sort.” I never heard boo from the Department on my message. I
                    thought at least I should have been castigated for being obstreperous. The next
                    time I went back to the State Department I was on consultation and was talking
                    to the head of intelligence for the Department, I think his name was Hughes at
                    the time. I told him that I had been very curious about the telegram having
                    never heard from the Department. He said, “Well, no wonder, you know when that
                    telegram came into the State Department it was the first time that anybody in
                    the State Department, myself, the Secretary or anyone else, had ever heard of
                    it. It was something that Kennedy did on his own with Murphy.” I might say with
                    equal lack of results as Senator Smathers which I have referred to earlier. But
                    I thought that was interesting with Kennedy acting on his own and not confiding
                    in the Department.</p>

                <p>My last connection with President Kennedy with regard to the Dominican Republic
                    occurred on June 7, 1961. When Trujillo was killed, the President was in Paris.
                    My nighttime message (May 31AM) reporting the event was promptly relayed to
                    him—so promptly that there were hostile allegations that he knew about the
                    assassination before it happened. Absolute nonsense, of course. I left the
                    country on June 5. On June 7 I attended a meeting in the White House with the
                    President and the main subject was the DR. This was as high level a meeting as
                    one could assemble—certainly the most imposing that I ever attended. In addition
                    to the President there were Vice President Johnson, Secretary of State Dean
                    Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, CIA
                    Director Allen Dulles, J.C. King (also of CIA), and Acting Assistant Secretary
                    of State of Inter-American Affairs Wymberley Coerr. The President asked to be
                    informed on what was transpiring in the DR and then he asked for suggestions as
                    to what was likely to happen next and what our position should be. His questions
                    were directed to Dean Rusk, but Rusk deferred to me for response. I have no
                    record of this meeting unfortunately, but there must be one in the Kennedy
                    files. I reported on my meeting with President Balaguer of June 4 in which he
                    said that he did not require our assistance for the time being as Ramfis had
                    agreed to respect the civilian authority. As I recall, I said that I did not
                    believe there would be a bloodbath though there might be isolated vengeance
                    killings. I also said I thought that we should continue to support the pro-US
                    dissidents since as long as the Trujillo family was in the DR they would try to
                    control the country and the reprehensible conduct for which they were noted
                    would be perpetuated. I remember Kennedy saying that he wanted to be sure that
                    whatever replaced the present government was acceptable to us. He did not want
                    the government overthrown until he knew what would replace it.</p>
                <p>One enlightening part of the discussion occurred when I interrupted and said: “I
                    think that.......” The President interrupted me and said, “We already know what
                    you think.” That showed clearly enough that he had been reading my cables. After
                    the discussion on the DR, the President went on to talk about situations in
                    Angola and other places and about getting some businessmen into the AID program.
                    The latter subject was mostly between him and Secretary McNamara. When the
                    meeting broke up, he shook hands with me and said, “You did a good job down
                    there, but I don't suppose you should go back, do you?” I told him that I would
                    rather have heard him say that than any one and that I agreed it was best not to
                    go back. I told him that I had already been assigned to Bogota and was very
                    happy with that assignment. I did not see him again until he came on a state
                    visit to Colombia. This conversation with the President I remember practically
                    verbatim—I guess because it was personal.</p>
                <p>The other thing I thought I should mention is that some years later, 1975, so
                    that is a long time later, I was called to testify, if that is the right word,
                    at least talk to a committee that Nelson Rockefeller set up to investigate CIA
                    activities, especially in relation to assassinations. I went and talked to them
                    on April 22, 1975.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me put into the record right now that Mr. Dearborn has
                        given me a tape which he taped in April, 1975 regarding his talk with the
                        Rockefeller commission concerning US actions against Trujillo in the 1960-61
                        period. We will put this in this transcript at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Taped by Henry Dearborn in April 1975.</p>
                <p>My relationship to CIA, June 1960 - May 30, 1961</p>
                <p>I arrived in the Dominican Republic as DCM in July 1959. Ambassador Farland
                    departed permanently in May, 1960 and I became Charg� d'Affaires a.i. On June
                    16, 1960 I was requested by CIA to be its link with certain opposition
                    leadership. This request had the approval of the Assistant Secretary for
                    Inter-American Affairs. My written understanding with CIA was that the US was
                    not prepared to undertake any overt action against Trujillo while he was in
                    control of the Dominican Republic. That CIA was prepared to assist the
                    opposition clandestinely to develop effective force to accomplish Trujillo's
                    overthrow and that prior to such time as dissident groups had established a
                    provisional government which would control a substantial sector of the Dominican
                    Republic, CIA assistance would be channeled covertly. (I would say that it was
                    not long afterward that the US did take overt action against Trujillo in several
                    ways.)</p>
                <p>I was authorized to convey this understanding to my Dominican contact from June
                    1960. For the duration of my time in the Dominican Republic I was in continuous
                    touch on a clandestine basis with a limited number of pro-US dissidents. They
                    gave me information about Trujillo's activities, both national and international
                    and about their own aspirations and plans. On my side I communicated to them
                    such information and advice as I was requested to communicate by the CIA.</p>
                <p>The US broke diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on August 28, 1960,
                    but we continued consular relations. I stayed on as Consul General. Almost all
                    non-State Department personnel departed, including the CIA station chief. There
                    were two exceptions. One was the secretary in the CIA office and the other was
                    the Air Force Colonel in charge of the missile tracking station at Samana
                    Bay.</p>
                <p>After the departure of Station Chief Reed I was in effect the station chief until
                    the arrival of a CIA chief, I think in January, 1961. Even after his arrival I
                    continued to be the principal contact with my dissident sources. My dual role
                    presented problems for me as I had to remember when I was acting with my CIA hat
                    and when with my State Department hat. My CIA messages went through those
                    channels and the CIA secretary would deliver incoming messages to me. The CIA
                    station chief, who had arrived in January left immediately following the
                    assassination of Trujillo. I left about a week afterwards, also.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I believe that the reasoning in Washington was that I should depart promptly
                    since the Trujillo family continued to be powerful and since I was known to have
                    been in touch with the dissidents there was no knowing what conclusion the
                    Trujillo intelligence apparatus might come to.</p>
                <p>There were three officers in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs in the State
                    Department who knew about my CIA work. The Assistant Secretary, his deputy and
                    his special assistant. Last named was the Bureau's liaison with CIA.</p>
                <p>That is the end of my memo on my relationship with CIA during my time in the
                    Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>Now a memorandum on the United States and the Overthrow of Trujillo.</p>
                <p>In 1959 there were two attempts from outside the Dominican Republic to overthrow
                    Trujillo and there was growing dissatisfaction with him inside the country,
                    especially among certain military, professional and business people and clergy.
                    By January, 1960, our assessment was that Trujillo was likely to be overthrown
                    and we were concerned lest a power vacuum would result into which communist
                    elements supported by Castro would rush. By that time we had drawn up
                    contingency plans as to what action we would take in such an eventuality.</p>
                <p>By July 1960, our dissident contacts were telling us that they had drawn up a
                    list of seven possible ways by which Trujillo might be ousted. All ways except
                    the seventh they believed to be beyond their capabilities. The seventh was
                    assassination. It appeared, however, at that time they had no specific plot and
                    that they were talking in generalities. Neither then nor later did they seek to
                    involve us in an assassination. What they wanted from the US was moral support
                    and, later, material and token weapon support.</p>
                <p>The following are some of the ways in which we gave moral support to the
                    dissidents:</p>
                <p>1.We established our clandestine contact with them.</p>
                <p>2.We made several attempts through prestigious persons to persuade Trujillo to
                    give up his dictatorship, preferably by leaving the country. One attempt was
                    made through General Mark Clark. Another through Senator Smathers, another
                    through Ambassador Robert Murphy. Clark was acting for President Eisenhower and
                    Murphy for President Kennedy. None of these approaches shook the Generalissimo's
                    resolve to remain in power. These were all secret missions when they were
                    undertaken. I was with Senator Smathers when he made his pitch.</p>
                <p>3.We issued official public statements critical oTrujillo, and</p>
                <p>4.In August, 1960 we broke diplomatic relations.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>After the break in relations we took steps to offer material support to
                    Trujillo's opposition.</p>
                <p>1.We levied economic sanctions against the Dominican Republic, and</p>
                <p>2.In January, 1961 I was authorized to tell the dissident contacts thawe would
                    make certain military items available to them.</p>
                <p>The memo following this one will deal with the arms question.</p>
                <p>After August, 1960 we developed more detailed plans for dealing with a
                    provisional government in case Trujillo fell from power. We knew who of our
                    contacts wished to head such a government, but we did not know whether these
                    elements would be capable of gaining a foothold. The situation was going from
                    bad to worse. As the result of the economic sanctions imposed by the US and the
                    OAS, Trujillo was threatening US businesses resident in the country and was also
                    threatening the pro-US Dominicans. His media were carrying on a steady press and
                    radio war against the US</p>
                <p>In this atmosphere by the spring of 1961, those who favored assassination in
                    concept began to develop concrete plans. Considering the opposition of the
                    business community, the clergy, the US, and the OAS it was believed that those
                    who assassinated Trujillo would be regarded by heroes both at home and abroad.
                    Also since no pressure that had been tried, i.e., persuasion, sanctions,
                    diplomatic ruptures, statements of censor, had induced Trujillo to give up,
                    these dissenters saw assassination as their only hope of ridding the Dominican
                    Republic of the dictatorship.</p>
                <p>It is my firmly held view that those who killed Trujillo and those who backed
                    them up would have acted if there had never been a CIA. They were only waiting
                    for as favorable domestic and international atmosphere to give them the required
                    courage. The concept and details of the plot were theirs, and theirs alone. It
                    is true that the US helped create this atmosphere more through public than
                    covert action. Being convinced that Trujillo was on the skids it was our purpose
                    to cultivate the pro-US dissidents so that the future government of the
                    Dominican Republic would be pro-US rather than anti. Such help as we gave them
                    was to help them come out on top of any rival groups. We never favored
                    assassination, in fact, we opposed it to no avail.</p>
                <p>When in April, or May, 1961, I received detailed assassination plans from my
                    contacts, I advised Washington that what had been a possibility now had become a
                    probability. I was convinced of this because of the detailed nature of the plans
                    and the electric tension in the Dominican air. This information caused
                    consternation and I was instructed to urge that any such plot be abandoned
                    immediately. My contacts responded that this was a Dominican affair and there
                    was nothing we could do to stop it. This message I transmitted to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Not long afterward the plot was carried out.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>This next memorandum is on the question of arms.</p>
                <p>I do not recall exactly when the pro-US dissidents first urged us to supply them
                    with certain military equipment. However, I know for certain that in January,
                    1961, I was instructed to tell them that delivery of such equipment outside of
                    the Dominican Republic had been authorized. I do not know what, if anything, was
                    delivered to them. Perhaps nothing, because my contacts continued pressure on us
                    to offer at least a token. They argued that there were members of their group,
                    especially younger ones, who were demanding that the US show our support in this
                    tangible way. My contact said that it was important to them not to lose the
                    support of this younger element as there were many able people among them.</p>
                <p>Perhaps CIA records will show, I do not remember just when I was authorized in a
                    CIA memo to turnover to the CIA station chief several, I think four, perhaps
                    two, rifles that were left with the Consulate General on the departure of the
                    Naval Attach� in 1960. This must have been in April or May, 1961. I turned over
                    the rifles and I do not know to whom they were ultimately delivered. So, I do
                    not know whether any of them were used to kill Trujillo. Since a number of high
                    military personnel were in on the plot, the obtaining of a small number of arms
                    sufficient to kill a man did not seem to be a problem for the plotters.
                    Consequently the dissident request for arms from us seemed symbolic rather than
                    anything else—a move to help our pro dissident contacts to hold doubting
                    Thomases among them.</p>
                <p>I discovered after returning to the United States that no one in the Bureau of
                    Inter-American Affairs in State had known of the CIA message authorizing me to
                    turnover the rifles. This came as a shock to me as there had always been a very
                    close and harmonious relationship in the Office of the Assistant Secretary and
                    CIA regarding my activities and instructions that were sent to me. This was the
                    only lack of coordination that I recall. Since the authorization was rather an
                    important one I have always wondered if it may have been cleared in the White
                    House as there were officers there who were closely following Dominican
                    developments.</p>
                <p>This is the end of the three memoranda on the Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>Tomorrow, April 22, 1975, I am going to appear before Vice President
                    Rockefeller's committee which is investigating CIA activities abroad. In this
                    case they want to talk to me, I suppose, about CIA involvement, if such there
                    was, in the assassination of Trujillo.</p>
                <p>This is Tuesday, April 22, and at 9:30 this morning I went to 712 Jackson Place
                    and called on Mr. Monty Grey of the Rockefeller Commission. I spent two hours
                    and a half discussing with him CIA activities in the Dominican Republic,
                    particularly from January 1, 1960 up through the assassination. He was, of
                    course, particularly interested in any arms that the CIA might have brought into
                    the Dominican Republic or might have authorized to be delivered.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Mr. Grey had done a great deal of research in both State and CIA files prior to
                    my arrival and he had many pages of notes on the basis of which he asked
                    questions of me.</p>
                <p>This was a fascinating exercise for me because I had, of course, forgotten quite
                    a number of communications and actions to which he had reference. Particularly,
                    and to my surprise, I had forgotten that I had delivered a revolver to a
                    Dominican doctor. The reason that I had done this was not in the CIA files and
                    so I was able to recall after having my memory jogged that this doctor had asked
                    me if I could obtain a revolver for him in as much as he greatly feared some
                    sort of attack on his family by one of Trujillo's agents and he, the doctor, had
                    no means of defending himself or his family. I thereupon asked the CIA station
                    chief if he could obtain a revolver for me for the doctor, inasmuch as the
                    doctor was a principal source of information for us. The station chief,
                    thereupon did obtain the revolver and I gave it to the doctor.</p>
                <p>I made it clear to Mr. Grey that the doctor's request for this revolver had no
                    revolutionary purpose whatever, but was entirely for his personal use.</p>
                <p>DEARBORN: In the same year, the Senate set up what was called the Senate Select
                    Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence
                    Activities. It was to study alleged assassination plots involving foreign
                    leaders. The reference is 94th Congress, First Session, Report 94-465, issued
                    November 20, 1975.</p>
                <p>I spent about six hours talking to this committee's lawyers under heavy
                    questioning. They told me that they didn't think the Senators would want to talk
                    to me, but four days later I had a telephone call telling me that Senator Church
                    and his group did want to talk to me. So I went up and spent several hours alone
                    with about six of the Senators—the ones I remember are Senators Church, Mathias,
                    Tower, and Hart. Hart was a hero to me. The questions became quite detailed.
                    Each Senator had a lawyer sitting next to him reminding him of different things.
                    One of the lawyers, a woman probably in her mid '30s, spoke up and said, “Wasn't
                    this one of the most dramatic assignments of your career?” I said, “Yes, of
                    course it was.” She said, “Well, doesn't it seem strange to you that you don't
                    remember more of the details?” I said, “I hope there is someone in this room who
                    is over 65 years old who finds it difficult to remember who said what to whom 15
                    or 20 years after it has happened.” Senator Hart spoke up and said, “I certainly
                    can testify to that. It happens to me all the time.” He was the only Senator
                    there who was over 65.</p>
                <p>The main questioning was by Senator Church and the lawyer who sat next to him. It
                    went on for a very long time. That whole testimony appears in this Senate
                    Report.</p>

                <p>DEARBORN: Yes, anyone can get it from the library. There is a lot in it on the
                    Trujillo assassination and various other assassinations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: September, 1961 to April, 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could tell me how that assignment came

                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Fulton Freeman was Minister Counselor in our Embassy in Belgium and was
                    assigned to Bogota as Ambassador. He was in the Department and was looking for a
                    DCM. He talked to the people in Inter-American Affairs and my name came up. He
                    looked over my record and talked to people who knew me and said “Well, that is
                    the one I want.” And that is how I happened to go. I had never seen him
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fulton Freeman had at one time been a Far Eastern expert
                        hadn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: He still had his Chinese language. He took great delight in talking
                    Chinese with the Chinese Ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was sort of moved out of the line of fire after the
                        McCarthy time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: He came out on the Gripsholm when everybody was coming out of China,
                    and he never went back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate, because you served twice with him
                        didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: To my way of thinking he was a masterful leader in the sense of how to
                    run an Embassy. He knew how to get the best out of his people. He wasn't one of
                    these ambassadors who I always thought made a mistake when they would surround
                    themselves with two or three people and operate with them and let the rest of
                    the Embassy sort of float. He was a great team player and he expected input from
                    everybody. Everybody seemed to like him and the way he operated. He had staff
                    meetings every morning with the top officers and then he had a large staff
                    meeting once a week with all the officers. He would tell them what was going on,
                    what he was doing, what was going on between our country and that country. This
                    gave everybody the feeling of being in on a team effort. Everybody could ask
                    questions. So it made for a very good operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Colombia when you got there in
                        1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I would say one of the main problems that Colombia had when I got there
                    was with the violence in the countryside which was ruthless and savage. It
                    wasn't as bad as it had been, it was tapering off somewhat. There was a time
                    when you couldn't travel in the interior without expecting a problem. This was
                    violence between political parties. It had a long tradition, between the
                    Liberals and the Conservatives. There was an old party leader called Laureano
                    Gomez who was President and the hero of the Conservatives. Then there was a
                    short period of dictatorship under General Rojas Pinilla, but he was thrown out
                    eventually.</p>
                <p>The man who was most responsible for bringing the government back into
                    constitutionality was Alberto Lleras Camargo who had been director of the
                    Pan-American Union previously. A very able statesman. He worked out a system
                    where they would have alternate Presidencies between the parties—four years of
                    Conservative, four years of Liberal.</p>
                <p>When I arrived he was President. The violence continued in certain parts of the
                    country and some of it was between the parties, but also there was some growing
                    violence among leftists who wanted to overthrow the government and put in a
                    leftist system, Marxist system. That was another type of violence. This didn't
                    happen too much on the coast, it was mostly in the interior.</p>
                <p>The other main problem, I guess, while I was there was the dollar crunch. They
                    were having a difficult time getting dollars. As a result, AID and the Monetary
                    Fund were involved in trying to help Colombia adjust their system to alleviate
                    this problem Some very sticky balance of payment loans were conducted and caused
                    quite a bit of resentment on the part of the Colombians because ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that there was a monetary problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: The US AID and Monetary Fund people who were interested in monetary
                    adjustments were putting too much pressure on them. More than they could stand
                    politically. In fact, I was noticing the other day something I had forgotten.
                    While leafing through an old Colombian file I found a performance report on
                    myself in which one of the favorable comments the ambassador made was that I had
                    assisted considerably in setting the proper perspective in these type of
                    negotiations by emphasizing the political aspects and that certain things were
                    just not possible if we didn't want to overthrow the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to spell this out a little more. There often is this
                        clash within a country—the United States telling a country what it should
                        do, etc. But sometimes these things can have tremendous impact on the
                        political situation which can blow it all up. Were you arguing with the
                        financial wizards that deal with this in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: We would have discussions in staff meetings. Once I got into a
                    difficult position because President Lleras Restrepo one day called me over to
                    the Presidency, I was Charg� at the time, and talked about this very question.
                    He realized that I understood his political problem and said that he really
                    appreciated my sympathetic attitude. We let up on the pressure as a result of my
                    going back and telling what had happened. It was something you did have to put
                    the brakes on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Colombia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Well, we had oil interests. There were various smaller American
                    businesses. Colombia was a great exporter of flowers. I had one friend who left
                    an oil company and went into exporting flowers. It still is an important export
                    to the US</p>
                <p>We had rather an active American-Colombian Chamber of Commerce. The presidency
                    was supposed to alternate between a Colombian and an American. Once we got into
                    the situation where an Argentine was president because he represented Braniff
                    Airways. We had airlines coming in there. There were several small businesses.
                    Petroleum was the biggest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How heavy did you find the hand of the American business
                        side on the Embassy and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Not very. One thing that Ambassador Freeman did, both in Colombia and
                    later in Mexico, that was very helpful for us to keep tabs on American
                    businessmen, was to have a meeting once a month with certain selected members of
                    the American business community. It was a good source for us and he would tell
                    them what we were up to that wasn't secret.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The petroleum companies were of course very important and I suppose in their own
                    relations with the government they probably exercised an influence. But I would
                    not say that American business was driving our relationships with Colombia. Our
                    relations with Colombia must have been among the better relations of all
                    countries. I remember with our CIA operations. We had a big CIA operation in
                    Colombia. Sometimes they wanted to do rather extreme things and I had to remind
                    them that Colombia was a friendly country and they didn't have to bug offices.
                    They voted with us in the UN practically all the time; they were very
                    cooperative. The only sticky problem we had were these aid negotiations and that
                    was a matter of political consideration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that this was just a matter that the CIA was
                        there and as long as they were there they had to keep active?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Well, you know, we were trying to keep tabs on what Castro was doing.
                    There was a strong leftist movement in Colombia off in the mountains trying to
                    do what Castro did—and still is. But they went into decline after the Bay of
                    Pigs. When it became evident that Castro had tried to build up a nuclear
                    capacity...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean after the Cuban missile crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: That is what I mean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was October 6, 1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I know the exact day it was because I was in New Hampshire. My father
                    died on October 20 and I called the Department to ask for permission to fly up
                    to New Hampshire. I would turn things over to the counselor for political
                    affairs, be gone a week and then come back. I had a phone call back from ARA
                    saying. “Look, we have your message and we are thinking about it. We will look
                    into it.” I thought that was pretty strange. I thought granting my request would
                    be automatic. I was Charg� which was the problem. The Ambassador was on home
                    leave in the States. Finally they called back and said, “We have finally
                    arranged things so that you can do it. But you leave on Saturday. The Ambassador
                    will arrive a few hours after you leave and will be there all the time that you
                    are in the States. You go back next Sunday and the Ambassador will return to the
                    States to complete his home leave.” I wondered what was going on here, the
                    Ambassador interrupting his home leave to come back? Well, what had happened was
                    that the White House had already issued instructions that all ambassadors were
                    to be at their posts and they knew what was coming up. So I was in New Hampshire
                    for a week and came back passing the Ambassador in a plane.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back, what was the reaction that you were
                        getting from your Colombian contacts to the whole Cuban missile crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I suspect it was the same in most of Latin America, but in Colombia
                    they did a double take. They thought more carefully about the dangers of Cuba.
                    The question of quarantine came up. I have forgotten the date now, but Averell
                    Harriman was sent on a special mission around Latin America to tell the
                    Presidents about actions against Cuba. I wish I could remember better about
                    this... Covey Oliver was Ambassador at that time, so it must have been quite a
                    bit later. The Harriman thing had to do with Cuba I am sure, but I can't
                    remember exactly in what way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we were tightening the screws on Cuba all the time.
                        This was probably a bolt in the OAS to keep Cuba out or something of this
                        nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I wish I could remember more to put it in perspective. One incident in
                    connection with that Harriman visit was interesting. Valencia was President and
                    he used to become ill with some frequency. Some people said he drank too much
                    and other people said that it was a health problem. Harriman had a prearranged
                    appointment to call on Valencia at a certain time. I went with him and
                    Ambassador Oliver to the Palace, got out of the car and the Secretary General of
                    the Presidency came to the Palace door and said, “You know, I am terribly sorry
                    but President Valencia is not going to be able to receive Mr. Harriman, he is
                    very ill.”</p>
                <p>Of course, the first thing that went through my mind was, “Was he really ill or
                    what?” Then he continued to say, “If the President is feeling better by evening
                    he will come out to the Embassy to see Mr. Harriman.” Sure enough about 8:00 at
                    night the President drove out to the Embassy and we sat there and discussed
                    hemisphere security matters. I can't remember the details.</p>
                <p>About two days later I had a call from the Secretary General of the Presidency
                    saying, “Look, when you came over with Mr. Harriman didn't you have a member of
                    your USIA people taking pictures?” I said, “Yes, as a matter of fact we did. We
                    had a picture of the Secretary General, Harriman, the Ambassador and myself
                    talking at the front door of the Palace.” He said, “Well, I want a copy of
                    that.” The reason was that Alfonso Lopez, the leader of the opposition party,
                    had come out in public and said that it was absolutely undignified and unfitting
                    that the President of Colombia had gone to the American Embassy instead of
                    having Mr. Harriman come to see him. So with this picture they could prove that
                    we had gone to the Palace first.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it it was fairly easy for you and members of the
                        Embassy to deal with the Colombian government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes, they were cooperative on substance and friendly personally. Not
                    only that they were a very democratic country. You didn't have to worry who you
                    talked to. You didn't have to fear being seen talking to someone. Anybody would
                    talk to us. It was a great place for political reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what is it with this sort of openness of the
                        society? What causes this reputation and the one of violence. Even today
                        Colombians are considered to be a pretty dangerous group who immigrated to
                        the States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: It is rooted in history and I don't know how to say it. I do remember
                    the local newspaper, Es Espectador, which was the second largest paper, actually
                    conducted an inquiry among the readers. This wasn't on violence but was related.
                    The question was “Why are Colombians so irritable?” Over a two week period
                    people called and wrote in and then the paper reported on the replies. There
                    wasn't one single person who wrote or called in who denied that they were
                    irritable. But there were all kinds of explanations. Some said the altitude;
                    some said the racial mixture. They all had some notion as to what the problem
                    was.</p>
                <p>But it is related because irritations caused the violence. The organized
                    violence, as I say, goes back in history between parties. But then the
                    savageness of the violence...shooting a bus load of people who happened to go
                    into the wrong zone, or giving somebody the necktie cut as they called it where
                    they cut your throat and pull your tongue through the opening, cut off your head
                    and stick it in your stomach...all this absolutely outrageous behavior. I don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>When I was in Colombia (Barranquilla) the first time back in the early '40s, the
                    coast was very pacific. Nothing like this would ever happen. We all talked about
                    the violence in the interior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the drug problem, which now, of course,
                        dominates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: We had no drug problem. I never heard the word narcotics while I was in
                    Colombia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of our military attach� then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: The attach�s were doing what they do everywhere. But the military
                    missions were the ones that exercised the influence. We had an Army mission, a
                    Naval mission, an Air Force mission in addition to the respective attach�s.</p>

                        least supervising its general management, did you find that the military
                        missions sort of went off on their own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: No, we had good relations with the military missions. I can't really
                    remember any problems with them. Of course, the attach�s were engaged in
                    intelligence work. They were all good people. They tended to be officers who
                    were at the end of their career. The missions, of course, were under General
                    O'Mara in Panama—the Cinc...</p>

                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes. In fact, my relations with him were great. He invited me up to
                    Panama to go through his whole operation. He took me into the leaded room....
                    And he came to Bogota on occasion. He was rather “an enfant terrible” as far as
                    the missions were concerned. They were all scared to death of him. But he was
                    very nice to me. That was a time when I was the Charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember the dates, but you must have been there
                        during the time we had to send troops into the Dominican Republic? Johnson
                        sent troops in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes, I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play in Colombia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Oh, nobody liked it. We had a Foreign Minister called Caicedo Castillo
                    who used to drive Tony Freeman crazy because he was so slow about doing
                    anything. I remember Tony asked me once to go over and talk to Caicedo about the
                    Dominican Republic. I suppose it was that time.</p>
                <p>There was nobody in Latin America who liked that. We had a solid international
                    commitment on nonintervention. I am sure Bob Woodward, when you talked to him,
                    probably told you about his experience with Dean Rusk. Bob, I think was the
                    Assistant Secretary at the time and thought that he should remind somebody about
                    the commitment. He went up and tried to tell Dean Rusk about these commitments.
                    Rusk listened and then pulled out his maps and said something like, “Now where
                    would be the best place to land?” As far as Lyndon Johnson was concerned, he
                    apparently gave very little notice to this commitment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not unknown. We messed around in Nicaragua during
                        the late 1980s and wouldn't pay any attention to the International Court
                        over what we were doing there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: Yes. Georgie Ann Geyer has just written a book on Castro. She is an old
                    time journalist. She was in the Dominican Republic interviewing people at the
                    time of this. In her book she is absolutely outraged that we did this. She said
                    it was unnecessary. It was just that Johnson was afraid it was going to become
                    another Castro's Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had two other ambassadors after Freeman left.
                        Covey Oliver came. He was not a career officer. Reynold Carlson followed. He
                        also was non-career. How did this work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Great. They were wonderful, especially Covey. I wasn't with Carlson
                    very long. Tony Freeman had gone to Mexico and he wanted me to go to join him,
                    but the Department said I would have to stay a few months with Carlson who had
                    never worked for the government, as far as I know. So I didn't know him as well
                    as I knew Covey. I was with Covey Oliver his entire two year tour as
                    Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Covey was great. He was well prepared. He had been dean of the law school,
                    international law, at the University of Pennsylvania and he was well acquainted
                    in international circles. As far as the Embassy was concerned, he just let me
                    run it. I laughed because when he first came in our first talk he said, “You
                    know I look forward to these evenings after the day is over, we can sit and have
                    long talks about things.” That was the last time we ever did it. He had the idea
                    he would only work on things that he was interested in. He had no idea how
                    demanding the job would be. However, he immediately became extremely busy. I
                    still keep up with him. He lives down on the Eastern Shore at St. Michaels. He
                    also has a house in Marine County, California. But he was a very good,
                    conscientious ambassador. We continued to operate the Freeman system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our various aid programs, particularly the
                        Alliance for Progress, how did this work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I think very well, except for the negotiations on finances which got
                    sticky everything was very smooth. You had people in so many branches of things,
                    agricultural, education, housing, etc. When I got there they had these
                    agricultural services. Agriculture, of course, is the big thing in Colombia and,
                    of course coffee exports to the US were an important aspect of our relations.
                    All the people who were working with the Colombians in the AID mission seemed to
                    be delighted with the Colombians and with their work. I really can't think of
                    any real difficulties, except in balance of payments negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was told that at one point the Colombians sort of
                        surprised everybody in the AID mission by saying, “Okay, we think we can do
                        it alone now, we don't need your experts anymore.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: That was a fraud. I know exactly who that was. It was Sanz de Santa
                    Maria. During these negotiations he got mad and blew up one day and said in so
                    many words, “The hell with you, we will go it on our own.” But he didn't mean
                    that. He was a very dramatic fellow and you have to take that into account. Was
                    it Sam Eaton who told you that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it was a man who is trying to work up an oral history
                        account from the Latin American side of the Alliance for Progress. I want to
                        say Messner, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Was he in Colombia?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know, but he was telling me about it. He said to
                        ask this question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I guess it is the same thing. He might have run across some memo or
                    telegram, but Sanz de Santa Maria in my opinion was just putting the pressure on
                    us by purposely throwing a fit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was drama and no real change in the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: None at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else you wanted to say about your time
                        in Colombia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: We had a very large Peace Corps. Colombia was one of the first
                    countries to receive the Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say that I really think it was the
                        first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: The Peace Corps and I arrived in Colombia the same month, September,
                    1961. It got to be over a thousand. I remember the Ambassador had a staff
                    meeting the focus of which was to study how big we should let this get. It might
                    get to be counterproductive if it got too large. It was mostly in community
                    development. But it also got into educational television. In fact, I just ran
                    across the other day, I don't know if you have ever heard of Tedson Myers who is
                    a lawyer and came down to negotiate an agreement with the Colombians on
                    educational television. Now he is President of the Cosmos Club and we ran across
                    him the other day. I hadn't seen him for years and he reminded me of this. I
                    think he was also on the DC Council.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>But then they also got into nursing. Mainly it was community development out in
                    the boondocks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern about them getting mixed up with the
                        violence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: They never did. We thought about it, but they never did. We left them
                    completely alone. We never sought them out, they didn't want to be connected
                    with the Embassy. We always kept our connection with the head of the Peace
                    Corps. Aside from that, unless some of the boys and girls came looking for us,
                    we didn't bother them. But I used to go off at least once a year inspecting our
                    consulates in Colombia and would see some of them then. They would take me out
                    to see their projects. President Lleras Camargo was delighted with the Peace
                    Corps. He said it was wonderful.</p>
                <p>I am trying to think of the things that stand out most during my stay in
                    Colombia. One was the Kennedy visit to Colombia and I was the officer in charge
                    of the visit. It was a tremendous success. They all felt that they knew him
                    personally and when he died the whole country went into mourning. It was a
                    tremendously impressive thing.</p>
                <p>Once I went out with the only person who could have done it, to visit some
                    Indians called the Motilonis who live in a hunting, fishing stage of
                    civilization. Nobody could go into the area because they had bows and arrows and
                    would shoot strangers. They did this at the time a pipeline was being built
                    across Colombia to the coast. The builders had a running war with these Indians
                    because the pipeline went through their territory. The Motilonis shot a number
                    of the oil workers. They had arrows with reverse notches which you couldn't pull
                    out. You had to take them out in the direction they were going. But this fellow
                    I knew, Bruce Olson, had lived with them for some time and he asked me if I
                    would like to visit them, and I did. It was something never to be forgotten.</p>
                <p>Traveling to places like Leticia, down on the Amazon in the southern most corner
                    of Colombia was a great experience. It is another world buried in the Amazon
                    jungle. You can practically walk to Brazil from Leticia. There were more big
                    cities in Colombia than in most Latin countries. Most Latin countries have one
                    or two big cities whereas Colombia has 8 or 10. But the cities weren't always
                    the most interesting as the hinterland was often fascinating and the roads for
                    seeing it was fairly good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, you then went to Mexico City as DCM in 1967.
                        Did you go directly from Colombia? How long did you serve there?</hi>

                <p>DEARBORN: Yes I went directly to Mexico City. I was there from April, 1967 to
                    September, 1969. I went there because Tony Freeman asked for me. He left
                    Colombia in 1964 to go to Mexico. His DCM was Clarence Boonstra who was being
                    assigned as Ambassador to Costa Rica. So Tony Freeman asked for me and the
                    Department said I could go but would have to stay a few months with newly
                    arrived Reynold Carlson. So as soon as those few months were up, I went to
                    Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Mexico? The Mexican-American
                        relationship is always a difficult one. Did you find yourself really in a
                        different world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Well, the thing that surprised me the most was that they were so
                    friendly. I had never been in Mexico. Back in Yale Graduate School I had written
                    a history of Mexico from the Aztecs to Cardenas in 75 pages. So that was what I
                    knew about Mexico. Considering our history I was astonished at how friendly they
                    were and how helpful they were. What they were saying behind my back I have no
                    idea. But they certainly put up a good front.</p>
                <p>It was a completely different relationship with the government. In Colombia the
                    Ambassador or I, if I was Charg�, could see the President anytime we wanted to.
                    But that didn't happen in Mexico. You just didn't see the President. You went
                    through the Foreign Minister. I think that was quite a shock to Tony Freeman
                    when he got to Mexico. He wasn't used to that and he had to get used to it
                    because that was the way they operated.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate in a way. As you say, the relations have difficulties, but
                    looking over a long period, our relations with Mexico during the Freeman years
                    were about as good as they have ever been. We had an excellent relationship with
                    the Foreign Minister, Antonio Carillo Flores, who had been ambassador in
                    Washington. He was an exceptional person for any position. He would have been a
                    great Secretary General at the UN. In fact the Chileans approached him and asked
                    if he would be receptive to that position. I went over and I asked him if it
                    were true that he had been approached. He said, “Yes, they did ask me, but I
                    gave them General Sherman's answer.” You could tell how much he knew about the
                    United States. I don't think there was another Foreign Minister in the world who
                    could have said that.</p>

                        serve.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I remember sending a telegram back to the Department reporting exactly
                    that. Later I found out that they thought that was my interpretation of what he
                    had said. I said, “Not at all, that was what he said.” He was excellent and the
                    reason in large part of our good relations at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have never served in Mexico but have heard that
                        traditionally as they slice things up within the ruling party, the Foreign
                        Minister is sort of thrown to whatever serves as the left there and is often
                        more anti-American. At least there are so many close relations on the
                        military side, on the security side and all with the United States, so the
                        Foreign Ministry is left to be the playground of those who come out of the
                        universities who are kind of anti-American and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Carillo Flores was the Foreign Minister during my whole period and that
                    was my good luck because he was pro-US. His right-hand man was also pro-US. Now
                    there were elements in the Foreign Office that were extremely nationalistic and
                    they took positions in the UN against the United States. The man in charge of
                    their relations with international organizations, Garcia Robles, was always
                    taking positions in the UN against us. It irritated the Department no end and
                    they thought he was a communist, which he never was. In fact, we became quite
                    friendly with him. The Counselor of Political Affairs was friendly with him. It
                    didn't change his mind any, however. He was a strongly nationalistic
                    Mexican.</p>
                <p>I was fascinated by the fact that the CIA station chief, who had been in Mexico
                    for many years, Win Scott, knew him well. He knew everybody by that time. In
                    fact, he knew the President. He was one man who could go in to see the President
                    whenever he wanted to because in the past when the President was Secretary of
                    Government, Win Scott had a close relationship with him. So Win's relationship
                    with the President was special. When he retired, just before I did, I said,
                    “Look, I know you don't want a big party, but let me take you and Janet out to
                    dinner.” I said, “I will take you out to dinner and invite any other couple whom
                    you might want and we'll have a nice evening.” I couldn't believe it when the
                    man that he wanted was Garcia Robles who was the bete noire of the US in the
                    Foreign Office. But it wasn't communism, it was Mexicanism.</p>
                <p>We had our problems. All the Latin American countries broke relations with Cuba,
                    but Mexico didn't. The Cuban Ambassador was present in Mexico. In fact it got to
                    be embarrassing at one point because he had been there so long that when the
                    dean of the corps was transferred, the deanship fell on the Cuban. In order to
                    avoid embarrassment to the Mexicans the Cuban just went home.</p>
                <p>The CIA had a big operation and their main concern was watching the Russians. It
                    was the first place I had been where there was a Russian Embassy. They had a
                    large establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about the Soviet influence in
                        Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: The main job of the Soviet embassy in Mexico was to watch the United
                    States. So we were watching them watch us. In fact, when in 1968 the Olympics
                    were held in Mexico, we had an Olympics attach� and an assistant Olympics
                    attach� sent down. The latter was a CIA agent. I guess they were hoping that he
                    could get some information, or defectors, etc. I think I have to mention that
                    that fellow was Philip Agee. As far as I knew he was a very nice fellow. I got
                    along well with him. He wrote up excellent reports on the Olympics. But after I
                    left Mexico, he defected and wrote a book exposing a lot of CIA activities which
                    caused a terrible situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was responsible for fingering CIA operators overseas,
                        including the killing of Robert Welsh in Athens in 1974, because he
                        continued a series of books about the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: He wrote this book called “Inside the Company, CIA Diary”. I never knew
                    what was wrong with Phil, but I know his personal life was messed up. We had a
                    telegram come in addressed to the Ambassador from a Washington lawyer saying, “I
                    want you to tell Phil Agee to send his children back to the United States
                    immediately.” So the Ambassador said, “I don't know what this is about. Call
                    Phil in and find out.” I asked Phil and he said, “Well, what happened is that my
                    wife lives in the Washington area with our two little boys. We are divorced. She
                    has custody of the children. I went up to see them and I saw how she was
                    treating those little boys [they were about 3 or 4 years old, let's say]. She
                    keeps them locked up in the apartment and won't let them go out to play. They
                    are going to grow up to be misfits. I couldn't stand it. I told her I wanted to
                    take them to the zoo. Instead of taking them to the zoo I took them to the
                    airport and brought them to Mexico. I am not going to return them.” So CIA told
                    him that he had to return his children or he was fired. He opted to be fired. If
                    you asked Phil if he were fired, he would say, “No, I quit”. If you ask CIA,
                    they would say he was fired. Anyway all of this was going on in his life and I
                    always thought he might have had some resentment against the company. How much a
                    part that played in his defection, I don't know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that being DCM in Mexico would be a

                <p>DEARBORN: We had 675 people there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then there are all these ties of people both in
                        Washington and Mexico City who call each other by their first names—from the
                        Agricultural service, the Parks service, etc.— who bypass the Embassy. Was
                        this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: I think one place where it caused us headaches was in the protection
                    business, because being on the border with people going back and forth they
                    would sometimes get into trouble. Sometimes they would get murdered, sometimes
                    they would murder. As a result of this, often a congressman would get involved,
                    because the family would write to their congressman and he would demand action.
                    The guy would be in jail and we would be pressed to get him out. Things like
                    that. There were a few cases like that.</p>
                <p>Another problem we had was with LBJ's brother. We assigned an immigration officer
                    to go down to Acapulco and latch on to LBJ's brother and try to keep him out of
                    trouble, because he was always getting in trouble.</p>
                <p>I was just noting that in spite of the fact that we didn't have any military
                    missions, and only a one-man AID office in the field of education, it was still
                    a very large Embassy. We didn't have any of those normal adjuncts that we
                    generally have in Latin America, but we had activities that we didn't have
                    anywhere else just because it was a border country. The FBI had a large office
                    because of fugitives, stolen cars, etc. Customs had an office there, Narcotics
                    had an office there. The only interagency spats that I can remember were between
                    Customs and Narcotics. And that only reflected what was going on back home. We
                    had a Public Health officer, we had a US Travel Service officer, we had a man
                    from the Weather Bureau, the Immigration Service and then we had nine
                    consulates. We had a supervising consul general and five consuls in the Embassy.
                    So it was a very big thing. If we had had the AID and military missions besides
                    it would have been colossal. It was like being mayor of a city to be DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problems with the consulates in Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: No, we had very good people in those consulates. I don't remember any
                    problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I remember one funny thing. The Consul General in Hermosillo was leaving. He left
                    quite suddenly and we needed a Consul General immediately. I happened to think
                    of a fellow by the name of John Barfield, who was taking a leave of absence at
                    his own expense and going to LSU for a year. He was the right grade and had had
                    experience in that field. I had just gotten a letter from him a little while
                    earlier saying that he was now interested in the big picture. He wanted to get
                    into policy matters and out of the consular field. But I immediately thought of
                    him and telephoned him. I said, “John, I have your letter here about what you
                    are interested in in the future, but there is an opening for a Consul General in
                    Hermosillo, would you be interested.” He said, “Give me five minutes to readjust
                    my thinking and I will be there.” Within a couple of weeks he dropped everything
                    and he became Consul General. He had been in Italy and he wanted to brush up on
                    his Spanish so he started attending Spanish classes with the teacher who was
                    giving lessons in the office. The first lesson he took he fell desperately in
                    love with her. They were married and now he is retired and they are living
                    happily in Tucson, Arizona. A happy ending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Olympics. It was sort of a messy
                        business with students...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Well, just before the Olympics there was a blowup. There were some
                    students that were trying to embarrass the government before the Olympics. The
                    government was determined not to have any disruptions during the Olympics. They
                    came down very hard on those students and there were no disruptions. They
                    managed to keep the law enforcement people pretty well out of sight. They were
                    behind buildings ready to pounce, however, and this was generally realized.</p>
                <p>The Olympics were a tremendous success in Mexico. They had an interesting aspect
                    to them. I don't know whose idea it was, but they had a sort of cultural fair
                    along with the Olympics. All of the participating countries sent cultural
                    contributions— paintings, dramatic productions, etc. We sent down the
                    Preservation Hall Jazz Band, among other things. They came to the Embassy and
                    played for us.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: The PRI was a fact of life. The Mexican power rests on a tripod of
                    business, agriculture and labor. The government has to keep those three elements
                    satisfied. Agriculture and labor tend to be on the left side and business on the
                    right side. They do a balancing act, if you do something for one you have to
                    find something to do for the others. They always say that the President of
                    Mexico is so powerful, but the fact is that he is powerful because he keeps his
                    finger on the pulse. In an election time, the candidate of the PRI goes out and
                    stumps the country as if his life depended on it. There is a reason for this. He
                    has to keep in touch. He doesn't sit up there and order people to do this and
                    that. He knows what he can do and get away with. But the Mexican stance in
                    general has to be leftist. Anyone in the State Department and US government has
                    to know this. And they have to have the image of standing up to the United
                    States. This is an essential part of a Mexican government retaining its support.
                    But within that we get along pretty well.</p>
                <p>And then we have tools that help us. We have these inter- parliamentary meetings
                    with Mexico. One year our delegation from congress meets with their
                    congressional delegation congress down there and the next year, up here. They
                    pick different places to make it more interesting. Once they met in Hawaii, I
                    think. These meetings help the legislators of each country understand their
                    respective problems. But you are right about there being so many
                    non-governmental connections—even more than when I was there.</p>
                <p>When I was there Mexican policy on foreign investment would not allow a business
                    dominated by foreign investment. Now you can. This is a big change.</p>

                <p>DEARBORN: It was something that was always listed among our problems. In the
                    inter-parliamentary meetings, for example, it was always a concern. The Mexicans
                    were interested in how the United States treated Mexicans who came up here. We
                    had had an agreement called the Bracero Agreement where a certain number of
                    seasonal workers were allowed to come up, but that wasn't functioning when I was
                    there—it was before.</p>
                <p>There was tremendous tourism, of course. Wherever you get a lot of tourists,
                    protection becomes a major problem. There were a couple of dramatic cases. There
                    was one up in Monterrey. There was a man in jail for murdering some tourists. He
                    was an American. His people appealed to US Congressmen and we got all this
                    pressure to do something about him. Finally he escaped and the last I heard of
                    him was that he escaped to Texas and not too long afterwards was murdered in a
                    barroom brawl.</p>
                <p>There was a dramatic rescue of somebody whose name I forget. It was written up
                    and I think they made a movie out of it. He was a man who was in prison and was
                    rescued by helicopter—he was flown right out of the prison yard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? There must have been quite a lot of
                        pressure on the Embassy to do something to get the guy back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I don't remember that. I think both sides were glad to be rid of him.
                    In fact, the fellow who escaped up in Monterrey, we always thought the Mexicans
                    looked the other way, being tired of him and the problems he was causing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about corruption? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: From our point of view, corruption was a way of life in Mexico. For
                    them it was a way of doing business. The mordida, as they call it, is the way of
                    supplementing a salary. Yes, from our point of view, nearly everyone was on the
                    take. To get a contract you had to throw in a little extra. If the police stop
                    you, you can give them a little something and get off. It is a way of life. I
                    don't know. When it is so deeply rooted how you can get rid of it. That is the
                    scary part. In any country, if it digs in how do you get it out?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you retire from this post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: Tony Freeman left in January, 1967. I was Charg� for over six months.
                    Along about February or March, I had a message from the Department saying that I
                    had been out 15 years and had to come home. It took me until the next morning to
                    send off a letter handing in my resignation. My thought was that I was 57 and
                    had 3 more years to go to retirement and I didn't want to work my last three
                    years in the Department. I had had 11 straight years in the Department, but that
                    was a long time ago. After they got my letter I had a phone call saying, “Look,
                    would you be willing to stay until we find a new ambassador?” I said, “I am
                    willing to stay here for 10 years; it is the Department where I don't want to
                    work.” So they said, “Great, we haven't found an ambassador yet so agree that
                    you should stay on until we do and then stay a couple of months with the new
                    ambassador.”</p>
                <p>Month after month went by and no ambassador. About July Bob McBride was named
                    Ambassador. When he arrived I stayed with him until September and then I came
                    home. Then I waited for financial reasons until February to retire.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>In September, the very month I came home relations with Mexico went into a
                    tailspin because Nixon, recently in the Presidency, and his cohorts did
                    something that we never would have done under LBJ. He suddenly, overnight,
                    closed the border because of the narcotics problem. He didn't tell the Mexicans
                    in advance even though he had just met a few days previously with the Mexican
                    President. Well, Diac Ordaz was furious. He said a wall of suspicion had arisen
                    between our two countries. This was pretty strong language considering how good
                    our relations had been. So the last thing I really remember doing before
                    retirement was writing a memo and sending it to everybody I could think of
                    saying that this was not the way to handle relations with Mexico. We had been
                    very successful with talking things over; being open and frank. But this
                    secretiveness and drastic action was not the way to do things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what caused this sudden border closing? Was
                        this a reaction within the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I think what happened was that the Justice Department, and especially a
                    man named Kleindienst grabbed the narcotics thing and ran with it. They
                    overpowered everybody else who tried to stop them. I remember saying in my memo
                    that I didn't blame the Justice Department and Mr. Kleindienst for what they did
                    because after all they are policemen and they did what they were supposed to do.
                    But I said I couldn't understand why they weren't politically overridden. I know
                    Kleindienst got a copy of this memo and he didn't like me very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He later went to jail didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: He did.</p>
                <p>Along about June, after I had retired, Charlie Meyer who was Assistant Secretary
                    for Latin America called me on the phone and said, “Look we want you to come
                    back to work.” I said, “Well, I retired to retire not to go back to work at the
                    Department.” He said, “Well, what happened is that we don't have a director for
                    Mexican affairs and we have a Presidential visit coming up and we need somebody
                    in there who is familiar recently with everything. Ambassador McBride told us
                    that he thinks you are the one. It will just be for a month or two.” So I agreed
                    and went back for a month or two—it got to be three months, four months, five
                    months. Finally I wrote a desperate memo repeating that I had retired to retire
                    not to work in the Department. Finally they let me loose again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well looking back on your career, what gave you the
                        greatest satisfaction would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>DEARBORN: I think that along the way to feel that I was doing something of
                    importance. I can't think of anything else that I would have done that I would
                    have been better at. I ended up with a happy feeling. I didn't feel unhappy when
                    I retired. I just figured that those last few years before compulsory retirement
                    didn't matter and I didn't want to spend them in the Department. I was quite
                    happy that I was retiring on my own initiative instead of being told that I
                    should retire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. I really appreciated
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DEARBORN: I didn't know quite what to expect. This job must be very interesting
                    to you.</p>
