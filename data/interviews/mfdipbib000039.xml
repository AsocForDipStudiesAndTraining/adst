                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 23, 1992 and this is an interview with
                        John A. Baker, Jr. which is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. I wonder if you could
                        give me a bit about your background—where you came from, were educated,
                        interest in foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I was born in Connecticut. My father was a mining engineer. My mother was
                    a very active internationalist, interested in all kinds of international issues
                    mainly from a humanitarian point of view. She was active in raising refugee
                    relief after World War II and in the initial efforts regarding the United
                    Nations. She was a delegate to the United Nations for a non-governmental
                    organization. So I had a fair exposure growing up to international issues and
                    was interested in them.</p>
                <p>I went to high school in Westport, Connecticut, then to the Loomis Institute near
                    Hartford and then to Yale, entering during World War II. In 1946, shortly after
                    I was eighteen I was drafted into the Army. I spent two years in the Army, most
                    of it as an infantry second lieutenant in Japan after completing the officer
                    candidate school at Fort Benning.</p>
                <p>I think that experience in Japan where one of my duties was to serve as
                    regimental information officer and brief the regimental officers on
                    international issues solidified my interest in a career in international
                    affairs. When I returned to Yale in 1948, I decided to complete a degree in
                    international relations and try for the Foreign Service. And I did that. I
                    finished my degree in 1949 and, after a summer job in France, took the exams in
                    Paris in 1949 and about a year later, after a graduate year at Geneva's
                    Institute of International Affairs, I was brought into the Foreign Service in
                    1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a Foreign Service class when you came
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give a description for someone who wouldn't
                        understand about what a class of 1950 was like, where the young officers
                        came from and how they viewed the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: A number of things, I guess, would strike one as odd about that sort of a
                    class. I thought it was a pretty high quality group of young people. They were
                    all men. There must have been perhaps 18-20 of them. Quite a few of them went on
                    to quite distinguished careers in the Foreign Service. A rather high proportion
                    of them remained in the Foreign Service. I think maybe something over half of
                    them or more stayed in the Foreign Service for most or all of their careers.
                    Harry Barnes was in the group. Lew Hoffacker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume that most of you came out of the
                        military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I think probably almost everyone in that group had served in the military.
                    Quite a few of them had active service during World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there was any general feeling about what you
                        were going to do, your role? Here you were the new centurions of American
                        foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I think we felt we were entering the Foreign Service at an important point
                    in history. You recall that in November, 1950, we were at war in Korea. A number
                    of us were wondering if we would get through our Foreign Service training and
                    assignment before we were recalled to active duty. For example, I was in the
                    Reserves at the time and I think a number of others were. But I don't recall
                    that any of us were picked up again.</p>
                <p>You know that was also the time when NSC 68 was being completed and laid out, the
                    old policy of confrontation, of containment of the Soviet Union, so I guess we
                    saw ourselves engaged in the developing struggle between two systems. We were
                    hoping to be on the front lines of that struggle, which we hoped would be
                    diplomatic rather than military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go from training into an assignment abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: At that time the training period was about three months and in the last
                    six weeks of that you got the afternoon off to work on whatever language they
                    seemed to be pointing you towards. I volunteered to go to Yugoslavia and
                    although not too many people were going to Communist countries on their first
                    assignment, I had one qualification that they seemed to be interested in and
                    that was that I was unmarried without children. At that time, hardly two years
                    since the Tito/Stalin break, there was some concern as to what might happen in
                    Yugoslavia. There were a lot of incidents on the frontier. The Soviets, using
                    the satellite armed forces, were provoking a lot of tension there.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be mostly Hungarian and Romanian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. So the Department didn't seem to be anxious to put a lot of
                    dependents at risk over there. So I lucked out and got the assignment I was
                    looking for partly on that basis, but also on the basis that I had already had
                    several years training in Russian at Yale and convinced them I could move
                    quickly from there into Serbian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got to Yugoslavia in 1951. How did you see Yugoslavia
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, Yugoslavia at that time, one sensed, was very much an authoritarian
                    Communist state. Initially I was in the Hotel Moskva in the center of Belgrade.
                    Small units of Yugoslav army troops would be periodically marching around and
                    singing in loud voices these “we are for Tito” type songs. One had the sense of
                    a poor, proud, embattled country that was standing up for its nationhood, but
                    not a country that was very democratically run. It was a tight shop
                    politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I started out initially as a junior officer in the political section
                    and I began to study the lengthy texts of people like Milovan Djilas who was
                    beginning in a cloudy way to express some of his own ideas, which later, as they
                    emerged, were dissenting ideas. Quite soon it appeared that, with the
                    improvement of US-Yugoslav relations, it was more possible for Yugoslav citizens
                    to leave the country and join their families in the US. So the consular section
                    needed help and I was the replacement cog as the most junior officer in the
                    embassy and sent to the consular section where I did some citizenship and a lot
                    of visa work for four or five months.</p>
                <p>It was a good experience in the sense that I immediately perceived that it was
                    disadvantageous to have to interview these people through an interpreter. It was
                    quite clear that the people being interviewed didn't quite trust the
                    interpreter, who was an employee of the embassy, a local national, and I wasn't
                    quite sure I trusted her either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Madame Zhukov?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She died while I was there. Madame Zhukov was the doyen of
                        the consular section.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BAKER: She was of Russian descent and that was another problem in the
                    sense...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, after her death, we found out she had been
                        playing hanky-panky with some of the visa cases.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: My perception was that the sooner I could get her out of the middle of my
                    discussions, the better off I would be. This gave me quite a stimulus to improve
                    my knowledge of Serbo-Croatian and within about a month I began doing all my
                    interviews myself. That got pretty tricky when the interviewee was Macedonian
                    and a person who spoke a variant of the language isn't always easy to follow.
                    But, anyway, I felt I got a sense of how the country worked from interviewing
                    those people and finding out how they lived and what they did, how they lost
                    their land, or what sort of situation they were up against in their
                    community.</p>
                <p>The tricky part of it was, you see, that almost all of them had, for one reason
                    or other, joined some front of the Communist Party. To get your normal access to
                    normal things it was pretty much what you had to do. So, for almost every one of
                    those cases we had to ask for a waiver of the McCarran Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A waiver from the Immigration Service because of
                        affiliation to some forbidden organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The McCarran Act didn't allow into the United States people who were
                    Communists or belonged to front organizations. So one had to be sure that in
                    recommending a person for a visa to join relatives in the United States any
                    connection they had with the Party or front organizations was in a sense
                    involuntary. It wasn't motivated by ideological conviction but by the need to
                    get a ration card, etc.</p>
                <p>I thought that that experience in the consular section was quite a formative one
                    for me in beginning to understand how that system worked in the lower levels of
                    society.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1951, I was out of the consular section for about six weeks
                    because, by that time, the United States was delivering food aid to Yugoslavia.
                    This was a controversial program because Yugoslavia was a Communist country,
                    which had not been very friendly to the US, and had shot down a couple of US
                    planes in 1947 without any particular regrets. In 1950, when they had a bad
                    drought, people generally perceived that the consequences of the drought were
                    much worsened by the fact that the Yugoslavia Communist Party had carried out a
                    very Draconian collectivization the year before.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The Titoists apparently were trying to prove to the rest of the world that they
                    were better Communists than the Russians—pure Marxist-Leninists. In that 1948-49
                    period, they were not cozying up to the US, they were emphasizing their
                    Marxism-Leninism and they managed to considerably screw up their agriculture and
                    become very vulnerable to the 1950 drought. So by the fall of 1950, it was clear
                    that they would not have enough food to get through to the next harvest.</p>
                <p>The Department of State took a proposal to the Congress, with Truman's support,
                    proposing that in order to sustain the Yugoslav heresy vis-a-vis the Communist
                    Headquarters in Moscow, that a food aid program be granted. Congress agreed to
                    that only on condition that a pack of US observers would be allowed into all
                    parts of the country, with access everywhere, to see where this food was going,
                    who was getting it, whether it was being identified as American food, etc. And
                    that was done.</p>
                <p>Most of these people came down from the Marshall Plan office in Paris and were
                    assigned jeeps and interpreters since most of them had no experience in the
                    country. They fanned out over the country. The one who had Macedonia suddenly
                    had a heart attack in April, 1951, and the Embassy felt it was important that
                    Congress be reassured that the whole thing was being tracked. I volunteered when
                    I heard about this to go down to Macedonia and track the food aid. So that took
                    me out of the consular section for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how this food distribution
                        system worked in Macedonia which certainly at that time was a very primitive
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, it was. My impression was that with the system we had set up it was
                    very difficult to do much more than spot check the whole thing. As far as I was
                    concerned, there could have been diversions of some of that food aid into
                    military reserves, etc. and it would have never come to my attention. All I
                    could find out in each town where I was going was: Had they received food? Was
                    it a town that was short of food? Were they getting the flour and was it labeled
                    and identified as American flour? Were people, the man-in-the-street type
                    people, getting it? And in most places I went they were. They didn't always know
                    where it was coming from. A lot of officials down in Macedonia were still very
                    Communist, even Stalinists, and not too happy with the idea that they were on
                    the dole from the USA. So not in every case were they spreading the word that
                    this was American assistance. But it did seem to be getting distributed. Again,
                    I can't say whether it was getting 100 percent distributed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there at that time, because I know ten years later
                        there were, a substantial number of former Yugoslav-American retirees in the
                        area who sort of carried the flag around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well there were places in Macedonia where you could encounter people who
                    had been in the United States in the twenties and thirties and had returned.
                    These were older men and they sat around the large town square and would
                    reminisce about that a bit. For example, Bitolj, in southern Macedonia, has
                    quite a collection of people with links to the United States that go back to the
                    beginning of the century, long preceding the communization of Yugoslavia. They,
                    of course, left that area while it was part of the Ottoman Empire, or at least
                    their families did. And there were a few other places around Macedonia where you
                    find that kind of community, but for the most part I didn't find that many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After finishing that, what were you doing at the
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: As I recall, I came back and worked some more in the consular section and
                    then in the fall of 1951, a person was sent out who was in the consular corps
                    and I went back and worked in what was a two-man political section. My
                    supervisor, a fellow named Turner Cameron, was first secretary and head of the
                    political section. He dealt mostly with the international implications of the
                    Yugoslav heresy and the US-Yugoslav relationship and agreements that were being
                    developed. My job was to analyze and report on the internal politics of
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were two things going here. One was the Djilas
                        thing, his book, “New Class,” which was a book on the whole Communist
                        movement. Were you seeing aspects of that? Were you able to talk to Djilas?
                        Was he still Vice President when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, he was. He was in the leading group. I think it was in the early part
                    of 1952 that he began putting out a series of articles that were theoretical, a
                    bit cloudy, but beginning to show some signs of working away from the standard
                    Communist position. But at the time I was there he was still a member in good
                    standing of the Politburo and considered to be along with Edvard Kardelj, the
                    Foreign Minister, Alexander Rankovic, the Interior Minister, and Tito, himself,
                    sort of the four core leaders of Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with the political elements
                        within Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Not a whole lot. They weren't terribly accessible and to the degree that
                    we had dealings with the governmental leadership, that was done mostly by the
                    Ambassador, who was George Allen, at the time, and the Deputy Chief of Mission,
                    Jake Beam. And sometimes Turner Cameron. I occasionally would be taken along as
                    a note taker for some meeting with the assistant secretary of the Foreign
                    Ministry and one time with Kardelj, who was the Foreign Minister, but as a third
                    secretary of the embassy, even in a normal country one wouldn't get a whole lot
                    of access to the top political level.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I was getting my access mostly by getting out into the country. I would go out
                    almost every weekend in an old converted jeep. In the fall, there would be these
                    marvelous wedding feasts in the villages. You would appear in one of these
                    villages and they would say, “Ah, you are an American” and everyone would be
                    happy to see you. You would get a certain amount of contact with the normal
                    Yugoslav citizen, particularly the farmer population, in those circumstances.
                    And, of course, those people were not great admirers of communism or Tito and
                    when they loosened up a bit they would tell you about it. They had not much use
                    for what was being done to Yugoslav agriculture and to their family prospects.
                    So from those kinds of low level exposures, which I had a lot of, I developed a
                    fairly skeptical assessment of the Yugoslav version of communism, even the sort
                    of third world version that they began to develop in 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the fissures within that state? As we are
                        speaking today in 1992 there is a full scale war going on between the Serbs,
                        Croats and Bosnians. Did you see the fissures within that society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: You certainly ran into it. It was just six or seven years after the war.
                    You would hear, of course, what had happened to Serbs during the war at the
                    hands of the Ustashi in Croatia. That was still a fresh memory. But nobody was
                    organizing to do anything about it because in a Communist state like that you
                    didn't organize. You kept your head down. So one didn't know what the potential
                    depth or consequence of those feelings might be. I must say now, forty years
                    later, it is kind of depressing to realize that even a generation that didn't
                    experience those things has had that transmitted to it. That is not a very
                    promising sign for the Balkans that memories are unbelievably long and bitter.
                    My own personal experience was mostly in Serbia and the trip to Macedonia, so my
                    familiarity with the culture of the country was primarily familiarity with the
                    Serbian outlook. I occasionally went up to Zagreb and I spent the summer of 1951
                    in Bled, about a month of it, as bag carrier for the Ambassador who went up to
                    Bled to be near Tito, who spent the summer at his castle up there in Bled. So I
                    got a little exposure to the Slovenes who have a very different culture and are
                    a different kind of people. They are more like what you are used to encountering
                    in the rural parts of Central Europe. A more rational, less passionate type of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about George Allen as Ambassador. At the time how did
                        he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BAKER: I liked George Allen. He had already been Ambassador a couple of other
                    places such as Iran. He was an experienced man and conducted the high level
                    business of the Embassy without much reference to people like myself unless he
                    needed a note taker or somebody to carry his bag for him to some event.
                    Socially, he was quite forthcoming. It was a small embassy. We were invited out
                    to the residence on Saturday afternoons in the summer to play badminton. I had a
                    pleasant social acquaintance with George Allen, but didn't have any day-to-day
                    working contact with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Jake Beam who later became a distinguished
                        ambassador in a number of places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I saw more of Jake. He was, as usually is the case in an embassy of that
                    kind, the guy who ran the embassy in a management sense. I enjoyed Jake. We had
                    a little picnic group that used to go out on Sundays and I was pleased to be
                    included in that pretty regularly with Jake and with Peg Glasford—Admiral
                    Glasford's daughter—who was at that time our USIA officer who subsequently
                    married Jake and went to Moscow with him—and Turner Cameron and one or two other
                    people. We would go out on Sunday picnics which were memorable. There was always
                    a good conversation and a lot of laughs at those events.</p>
                <p>But, again, most of my working contact was with my immediate supervisor who was
                    Turner Cameron and while I was in the consular section with Arnie Hettberg, an
                    experienced career consular officer. I regarded that as sort of normal as a
                    junior officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to sort of catch the spirit of the times, what was
                        your impression of the Soviet threat in this 1951-52 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I think we were continually aware of the incidents that took place
                    on the frontiers of Yugoslavia and often one or two people would be killed or
                    wounded in these incidents. They appeared to be designed to pressure and
                    destabilize Yugoslavia as part of what was then the Cominform campaign against
                    the Yugoslav dissidence. I think that, as long as Stalin lived, he hoped to be
                    able to unseat Tito and put into power people who would be responsive to his
                    leadership. But as time went on in 1951 and into 1952, it seemed to us that this
                    wasn't going to escalate particularly. It was more a harassment and pressure
                    campaign than a prelude to any significant military action.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Of course, we knew there was no major mobilization going on in Hungary or
                    Bulgaria. And in early 1952, we moved in the direction of drawing Yugoslavia
                    towards NATO and establishing a military mission there. By staking out that sort
                    of a presence I think it was made clear that we weren't going to be indifferent
                    to what happened to Yugoslavia. Of course, Yugoslavia had no intention of
                    joining NATO, but they did join what was then called the Balkan Pact. That was a
                    Pact with Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey. And Greece and Turkey, being members of
                    NATO, sort of then hooked Yugoslavia into that system. I forget when the
                    Yugoslavs moved out of that Pact. I suppose it was some time after the 1956
                    Congress when they were reconciling with Khrushchev and when it was clear that
                    the new Soviet leadership was not going to move militarily against them.</p>
                <p>But in 1952, you know, it was clear that they were moving tentatively into the
                    American and West European security sphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Belgrade in 1952 and came back to
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Actually I left Belgrade in July, 1952 because I was unfortunate enough to
                    get in the way of a fluoroscope which discovered that I had some kind of spot on
                    my lung. This may have been a consequence of living in that country. I was sent
                    up to Munich and was diagnosed as having tuberculosis. Even though it wasn't a
                    very raging variant, it was a rather stubborn one and I was out of the Service
                    for almost a year and a half because of that. Nowadays, with that kind of spot
                    on one's lung, one could just handle that with certain kinds of medication and
                    keep on doing what you are doing and it would take care of it, but then they
                    didn't have that and the gentle approach of curing the disease was a rather
                    lengthy sanitarium stay.</p>
                <p>So I didn't get back into business until early 1954. And that was a rather
                    curious way to reconnect because in 1953, as you may remember, the McCarthy
                    investigations were in full swing going after the Voice of America. That was a
                    nice target for McCarthy and his people because a lot of these people were
                    fairly new American citizens who had come after the war and were broadcasting
                    and writing script for Voice of America. The Voice wanted people fairly fresh
                    out of the area because their language would be more up to date with the
                    listeners, but they were either not yet citizens or new citizens and very
                    vulnerable to and frightened by the kinds of intrigue that developed around the
                    McCarthy investigation.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Not surprisingly, in the case of the Yugoslav Service of the Voice, it was a
                    field day for the Serbs who wanted to denounce Croats and Croats who wanted to
                    denounce Serbs. By the time they were through they had compromised the Service
                    Chief, who as far as I know was in no way a Communist or close to it, and a
                    bunch of other people and the Service was decimated gradually by these
                    investigations and dismissals.So the Voice of America asked the State Department
                    if they could come up with a candidate to run the Service who had no political
                    history that was worth looking into but who knew Serbo-Croatian and something
                    about the country. Well at that time I was about 26 years old—not old enough to
                    have any political history—and I did know Serbo-Croatian because I had been
                    there and was coming back to duty, so the Department asked me if I would take
                    this assignment to the Voice of America to run and restore the broadcasting to
                    Yugoslavia for the Voice of America. I agreed to do that.It was at that time in
                    New York. I was brought up in Connecticut so it was kind of convenient to go
                    home for weekends and things like that. I started this job and it was sort of a
                    colorful situation. Running the Russian Service was a fantastic guy named
                    Alexander Barmine, who was a former intelligence general in the Soviet Army who
                    defected just before the war. He was a real bear of a man and possessed of
                    definite views. We had a policy meeting every morning on how the events of the
                    day might be interpreted. The US Information Agency was just being formed then
                    and was looking over the process with some anxiety because of the
                    investigations. The policy officer in the Voice of America at that time was
                    Barry Zorthian who later became famous as the public affairs officer in Vietnam.
                    Barry would preside over the policy meeting and Barmine would have at him. I
                    would occasionally look for openings because it was quite clear often that
                    neither policy line that might be appropriate for Western Europe or the policy
                    line that might be appropriate for the Soviet world usually fit my audience. So
                    I was always looking for an opportunity to get a little elbow room so that I
                    could make broadcasts and commentaries and press coverage that would be more
                    relevant to this rather distinct audience that was neither Soviet nor free
                    world. That proved to be an interesting game. I found the Voice an interesting
                    assignment. I worked there directly under two Foreign Service officers in
                    sequence: King, and Jack Armitage, who in turn reported to a witty Viennese, Bob
                    Bever, European Division chief and on up to Gene King, the Program Manager,
                    famous as the voice of the “shadow”.</p>
                <p>I had a piece of luck in the spring of 1954 because Radio Free Europe was
                    starting up just down the street, on 57th street, in New York. It was the
                    beginning of the Eisenhower Administration and Radio Free Europe was sort of the
                    symbol of the rollback that the 1952 Eisenhower campaign and later John Foster
                    Dulles' initial policy thrust had emphasized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is to restore it to democracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't explain how they were going to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well, one of the ways they were going to do it was to create what would be
                    the equivalent to an indigenous radio station and this would not be like the
                    Voice of America, something that would explain America and broadcast regular
                    international news, but a program that would be focused on internal developments
                    of each of those countries. And, of course, Radio Free Europe at that time had
                    other tricks up its sleeves like sending balloons over Eastern Europe with
                    pamphlets. That sort of thing kind of died down after the initial enthusiasm,
                    but Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, broadcasting to the Soviet Union, got
                    firmly established and created audiences and staffs and began to progress.</p>
                <p>Well, at the outset they were thinking of establishing a broadcasting service for
                    Yugoslavia because the initial view was that Yugoslavia was another Communist
                    state and needed a free radio also. Well, once the new administration got into
                    power and began to look at the relationship with Yugoslavia and this rather
                    delicate game we were playing trying to stabilize a non-Soviet Communist state,
                    it was quite quickly concluded that this type of broadcasting would not really
                    serve the purposes of that policy.</p>
                <p>Radio Free Europe had gathered a rather experienced nucleus of a Yugoslavia
                    broadcasting service including a guy who had worked for BBC during the war as a
                    commentator, and a guy who had been an editor of a newspaper in Belgrade. So I
                    walked down the street and went into Radio Free Europe and met these guys who
                    were wringing their hands over the fact that they weren't going to have a
                    service for Radio Free Europe. I began to talk to them about coming to work for
                    the Voice of America. I was able to rebuild the Yugoslav Broadcasting Service
                    essentially around that nucleus of talent that the Radio Free Europe people had
                    preassembled and precleared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Yugoslav Service been pretty well cleaned out
                        because of the internal politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: When I got there the Service chief had already gone and several other
                    people who I never met, and there were investigations in process against two
                    people who were still there. I got acquainted with them and they seemed to me to
                    be respectable people, but I was unable to do anything about the inexorable
                    progress of those investigations and they also were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this everybody accusing everybody else for being a
                        Communist because they didn't agree with them? This is so Balkan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BAKER: I, of course, was never allowed to see what was in the files, who had
                    charged who with what. That was all supposed to be the business of the
                    all-knowing security officers. All I could do was say, “Look, this guy is a
                    talented person and I have no reason to believe he is not loyal to the United
                    States. I would like to keep him in the Service if at all possible and I would
                    like to have some understanding why that is not possible.” Well, I never got any
                    explanation and after a couple of tries it was made pretty clear to me that I
                    was obviously not in the know about all the stuff that was relevant. Well, I was
                    never very convinced that what they had in the files was all that reliable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to Alexander Barmine because he is a fascinating
                        character and I don't think much is known about him. Here he was a man of
                        very strong views about how to treat the Soviet Union news and all that.
                        What was he pushing for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: When we were doing editorial commentary in the Voice of America about
                    Soviet policies, because of the almost total confrontation at that time, he
                    generally wanted to take a tougher line than the policy people were ready to go
                    with. Often there was a line that was nuanced in some way for whatever
                    diplomatic reasons and that's what you get in government radio. The government
                    looks over the shoulder of the radio broadcasters who then have to program
                    reasons of state into what goes out. I have seen this on the other end of the
                    problem in the Department of State when some diplomat from a foreign country
                    comes in and complains about what is on our radio broadcasts.</p>
                <p>So there is always that tension between the interests of the government and the
                    interests of a broadcaster. Barmine, as a committed broadcaster, was out on the
                    edge of that confrontation. I have come to believe that confrontation or tension
                    between the government and the press is inevitable and probably healthy, but it
                    doesn't work very well inside the government because when you have government
                    media and a government overseer you sort of tilt the balance there because the
                    government has all the cards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had a real problem because obviously we were
                        taking a hard line, anti-Communist stand. This was our main confrontation
                        and yet here you were along with many people which went on for several
                        decades who did not want to destabilize Tito, who was a Communist but
                        because there were fears that if Yugoslavia went it could turn into another
                        one of those Balkan wars that would drag in all the European powers, and
                        with good reason looking at the situation as it is today. How did you work
                        this? You must have done a lot of cutting and watching to make sure we were
                        not giving the same message we were giving to East Germany to
                        Yugoslavia.</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BAKER: I had to really develop as much as possible our own program and a lot of
                    the features that were produced for use throughout the Voice of America I could
                    not use and did not use. So that meant I had to create my own and encourage
                    people in the staff to do that, although they were at first quite fearful
                    because they were afraid that if it was their own work somebody would pillory
                    them with it in some future round of investigation. But these new people I
                    brought in from Radio Free Europe had not been present during this shattering
                    experience of the McCarthy investigations so they had a little more courage and
                    also had more journalistic experience.</p>
                <p>One of them, a man named Grga Zlatoper, was a very talented commentator who had
                    broadcast commentary for the BBC into Yugoslavia throughout the war. I gradually
                    convinced the managers of the Voice that he should go on the air as a named
                    commentator under his own name. That meant that I had to go over each time
                    before he went on the air what he had in his script. He would take some of the
                    house material on the issues of the day and work some of his own ideas and some
                    commentary from the American press and create, in my mind, a much more
                    appropriate commentary for our audience. He, I think, really built the audience
                    for our Service. Eventually he became Service chief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you present divisions within our country—Democrat,
                        Republican, Pro and Anti-McCarthy, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: One way we did that was by broadcasting press reviews. We would have a
                    couple times a week a program in which we would excerpt editorials from the
                    American press around different themes, so we could show the different opinions
                    that were coming out in the country through the voice of the different American
                    newspapers. That way we were able to illustrate relevant views of American
                    opinion leaders without taking an official stand on them. We let the press speak
                    through us on certain issues.</p>
                <p>I also had members of the staff who wanted directly or indirectly to address
                    internal issues in Yugoslavia. We always had to do this rather obliquely. One of
                    the people was a clever writer and he developed a weekly program about a party
                    leader in a small district. It was a series of rather amusing incidents and
                    gaffs that bedeviled the life of this party leader. It was never clear whether
                    we were talking about a party leader of the Soviet Union, or Bulgaria or where.
                    This particular story didn't have a fixed locus, so in that way it made it
                    difficult for anybody from the Yugoslav government to complain about it because
                    if they did one could say, “Is that shoe fitting your foot? We didn't realize
                    that it was necessarily your people that were depicted.”</p>
                <p>We fooled around a little bit with stuff like that to stimulate listener
                    interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>One thing that stimulates them to this day, I think, was that every Saturday
                    night we broadcast a little jazz program by Willis Conover. Willis Conover
                    became a well known name throughout Eastern Europe for his recorded jazz
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feedback from Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Rather little. I guess people were hesitant still to identify themselves
                    as listeners through mail which they had reason to believe would be censored.
                    But at the end of my service at the Voice of America, in the summer of 1956, on
                    my way to my next assignment, I did a five or six week listener survey in
                    Yugoslavia. I went there and drove around the country and talked to people in
                    government, the press and in the street about Voice of America broadcasts,
                    whether they listened and what they liked. I made a full report of those
                    findings to the Voice by mail from my next assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression that you got from your
                        conversations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I would say that in terms of getting to them international news that was
                    relevant and timely and well presented, we probably never caught up to the BBC.
                    But because we were broadcasting from America, because America in the fifties
                    was where it was at in terms of power and influence, people wanted to hear from
                    Washington. So we had an audience that was built on that and strengthened I
                    think significantly by Grga Zlatoper, whose commentaries were very much
                    respected and listened to. I got very favorable playback on the commentaries and
                    press reviews and things that he did daily on the Service at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the BBC have a stronger listener appeal for the
                        news? I know when I was overseas I would tend to turn to the BBC rather than
                        the Voice of America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I don't know. I think they just do a very good job. As you say, I often
                    listened to BBC. If you were in Europe it often seemed that BBC had a more
                    sensitive ear as to what news stories in Europe were most relevant to where you
                    were and presented often more insights on them than you got in the American news
                    items. They have a long tradition of professionalism in news broadcasting. At
                    that time the Voice of America probably hadn't caught up to it yet.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BAKER: I was assigned to the US Consulate General in Munich, but actually posted
                    to Oberammergau where the US Army had established what was called Detachment R,
                    which sounds rather spooky but was really a two year course taught entirely by
                    Soviet defectors. There was nothing classified taught in this course because
                    none of the people giving it had any access to any. They were giving the course
                    in Oberammergau because most of them, because of the McCarran Act, couldn't come
                    to the United States, having been Communists in various parts of the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>In this sort of sanitized environment in a pretty little town in southern
                    Bavaria, I attended one year of this two year course that the Army had
                    established. That course was taught entirely in Russian. We asked our questions
                    in Russian and did our exams in Russian. So it was excellent preparation both
                    linguistically and substantively for an assignment to Moscow which I was
                    aspiring to and to which at the end of that year I got. It was on the way to
                    that assignment in Oberammergau that I did the audience survey in
                    Yugoslavia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Moscow in 1957-58?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, I went there in June, 1957, after an interesting month that I had
                    spent in Spain at the request of the State Department which had pulled me out of
                    the Soviet area program. The assignment in Spain was to interview the children
                    of the Spanish Civil War who had been taken to Russia as the Civil War was
                    ending in northern Spain. Many of them had been orphaned and as orphans of
                    heroes of the Spanish Republic campaigns, which the Soviets had heavily
                    supported, they were protected citizens in Russia. When the war started they
                    moved out to Central Asia but were never allowed to return to Spain until 1956
                    when they were given that option. Most of them took the option together with
                    their Russian wives and husbands and came back to Spain. They were one of the
                    first sociological samples that we had of what living in the Soviet Union was
                    like so an interview project was set up. Since I spoke Russian and Spanish, I
                    was asked to participate in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of this group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: They had lived in very difficult circumstances, although probably not any
                    more difficult than the rest of the Soviet population during and after the war.
                    Many of them, particularly the women, probably had gotten better educational and
                    professional opportunities in the Soviet system than they might have in Spain.
                    In Franco Spain, having been children and orphans of Republican heroes might
                    have somewhat limited their opportunities.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>They came back to Spain, even those of them who had become chemists and
                    engineers, primarily for Spanish reasons, I concluded. They were Spaniards. They
                    kept on feeling like they were Spaniards even though they were in the Soviet
                    Union. In spite of the fact that most of their adolescence and young adulthood
                    was spent in the Soviet system, they felt like Spaniards and they came back to
                    Spain. Some of them had a rough adjustment, particularly the women, because in
                    the mid-fifties a professional woman in Spain was a rarity. But they were not
                    regretting their decision. They had some respect for the opportunities they had
                    in Russia but a lot of the same kind of discontent with the authoritarian nature
                    of the system that the Russians had as well. I think they also felt they had
                    never really been fully accepted into that society. They had always been
                    regarded as foreigners, different, and maybe not to be totally trusted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I got there in June, 1957 just about the time when Khrushchev was dealing
                    with the anti-Party group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had already made his 20th Party speech denouncing
                        Stalin and all that. The repercussions must have still been going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Of course the repercussions of that speech in February, 1956, I had
                    already encountered somewhat in southern Germany and Austria in the fall of 1956
                    because the Budapest events in the fall of 1956 were certainly a repercussion.
                    There were Hungarians who were roaring through southern Germany back into
                    Budapest to help the people there. A month or two later there were people trying
                    to help them cross the border to escape the Russian reprisal. So by the time I
                    got to Russia the Russian leadership had been somewhat sobered by the
                    consequences of this secret speech at the 20th Congress. They were retrenching a
                    bit. Khrushchev was under pressure both for his initiatives at the Party
                    Congress which had these dangerous, for them, consequences in Eastern Europe,
                    but even more for the reforms he was trying to carry out in the Soviet
                    administration, particularly the administration of industry.</p>
                <p>He was creating councils of national economy, giving more local power to
                    bureaucrats in the provinces and republics and less power to the people in the
                    ministries in Moscow. Those were the people who had basically come up through
                    the Moscow Party ranks and formed the basic support of Molotov and Malenkov.
                    They were the people who that group relied on in their effort to unseat
                    Khrushchev in June, 1957. It was these newly empowered people from the provinces
                    around the country who Khrushchev and Zhukov brought in by airplane to the
                    Central Committee who rescued Khrushchev from an adverse vote in the Soviet
                    Politburo.</p>

                <p>BAKER: I arrived in Moscow just afterwards. I was assigned to the political
                    section to analyze Soviet foreign policy. I was interminably analyzing the
                    Soviet press for clues about changes in foreign policy. It was kind of a deadly
                    job. I had to read about seven or eight newspapers a day and produce a telegram
                    that summarized what was significant in them about Soviet foreign policy. It
                    struck me as a kind of bizarre thing to be doing because you could get those
                    same papers back to the research people in Washington within a few days and they
                    could do it probably better. But just to get maybe 48 hours jump...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of being one up or showing you are on top of it for
                        the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That's what it struck me as doing and it just seemed to me, having been
                    trained to be able to move around and talk to people, not to be the best use of
                    my skills.</p>
                <p>Consequently I went out, whenever I wasn't poring through these papers, and did
                    things and met people and had some rather unusual experiences, the consequence
                    of which was being expelled from Russia at the end of my first year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we come to that, what about the Embassy? What was
                        the spirit, how did Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Llewellyn Thompson operated with his cards very close to his chest.
                    Apparently he is a very good poker player. The press used to play poker with him
                    and had a lot of respect for his abilities in that regard. He was a quiet
                    person. He didn't glad hand much with the staff. We had very little contact with
                    him. Neither he nor his wife did a lot of outreach to the staff socially. That
                    was left to the Deputy Chief of Mission, Richard Davis and his wife, Harriet.
                    Harriet Davis was sort of the den mother to the Embassy, more than the
                    Ambassador's wife, Jane Thompson. It was a good embassy. I enjoyed serving in
                    embassies in the Communist countries because you had the sense of working in
                    conditions of adversity and on the front lines of the Cold War. You had
                    colleagues of high quality because I think the Department tried to send people
                    of high quality to those posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was certainly my experience in Belgrade. It was the
                        best group of people I ever served with.</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>BAKER: So, to me, in terms of working atmosphere and working personal
                    relationships, it was a real high. Those were good people. David Mark was the
                    political counselor. The political section had Foreign Affairs and Internal
                    Affairs sections. Morrie Rothenberg, who had a long career in INR and had been
                    Wristonized, was heading the Foreign Affairs section. In that section with me
                    was Ted Eliot who had come up after a year of doing the admin work in the
                    Embassy. Ted was later Ambassador to Afghanistan and Executive Secretary to the
                    Department. These were, I thought, first rate people. We got along well, had fun
                    together. We had fun with our British counterparts, the Canadians, the French,
                    etc. There wasn't any significant social life with the Russians because a
                    Russian wouldn't want to risk socializing with the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all with the Soviet
                        bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Not very much. I guess the only people in the Embassy who got involved
                    with them were the people in the Administrative or Consular sections. I went
                    rarely to the Foreign Ministry because we didn't have even that much contact
                    with the Foreign Ministry and what we did have was handled by the Ambassador or
                    the DCM or the chief of the political section. So I had virtually no interaction
                    with the Soviet bureaucracy, except when I went on a field trip of some kind and
                    then I would attempt to call up various local authorities to gather information
                    about that area. That was generally fairly unsatisfactory.</p>
                <p>I found most of the standard information I got about that society was a result of
                    accidental one-time exposures. Sitting down next to somebody in a crowded
                    restaurant where the waiter would put you at a table that was already partially
                    occupied. Or sitting next to someone on a plane or a train or in a theater, or
                    at the university.</p>
                <p>Those occasions were really extraordinary because often you would feel that the
                    person you were talking to soon realized that you were an American and thought
                    this was the one chance to say everything that he might want to say to an
                    American. It was a chance to say things he wouldn't even say to his neighbor
                    because he couldn't trust him. So you often had a two-hour conversation of the
                    most extraordinary intimacy with somebody you had never met before and who you
                    would never see again. They knew and you knew that they might be able to explain
                    that conversation on the grounds that the guy was sitting next to him, but how
                    would you explain going back for another conversation? You couldn't. If you went
                    back to see that American diplomat you must of been working something against
                    the interests of the Soviet state. So there was that sense that everything had
                    to be said, communicated and exchanged...</p>

                <p>BAKER: Often very personal tales of their own experience of great hardship,
                    hardship of their families, losses in their families, pressure by the
                    authorities of one kind of another, often many questions about the United
                    States, on the one hand illustrating that they had been infected by Soviet
                    propaganda, but on the other hand illustrating that they didn't trust it and
                    they wanted to check it against another source.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your analysis of Soviet foreign policy, how did you see
                        the threat to the West from the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: In the fall of 1957, there was a big conclave of all the Communist parties
                    on the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and that produced a heavily
                    negotiated document about the purposes and goals of the international Communist
                    movement. It was one of the first documents that attempted to do that. It was
                    significant because the Chinese were there and because East Europeans, after
                    these tumultuous events of 1956, were there and because the Yugoslavs were
                    there, beginning to be pulled back into the system but not being sure they
                    wanted to.</p>
                <p>That document, I think, illustrated the ambitious intentions of the international
                    Communist movement as led by the Soviets and, significantly, it began to open up
                    the attack on revisionism—revisionism being the kind of thing that happened in
                    Hungary and Poland, but also the Yugoslav variant. So the Yugoslavs didn't sign
                    on to this, or at least not all of it because they could see that the
                    international Communist movement was pulling back away from the promises of the
                    20th Congress of a more co-existing, open approach to the rest of the world and
                    more tolerance within the international Communist movement.</p>
                <p>So this sort of retrenchment was occurring. I don't think we understood fully at
                    the time all the reasons why it was occurring. One of the important reasons, in
                    retrospect, was the Sino-Soviet relationship. The Chinese under Mao were
                    disturbed by what happened in 1956 and they were trying to push the Soviets back
                    towards a more orthodox and confrontational stance vis-a-vis the US. And sure
                    enough in the winter of 1957-58, not only did you have these increasing signs of
                    tightening up within the system with the anti-revisionist drive, but you also
                    had the launch of a campaign vis-a-vis the West in Berlin. That was Khrushchev's
                    declaration that the anomalous situation in Berlin would have to be somehow
                    changed or resolved, or else. It was never very clear what “or else” would be,
                    but it was somewhat menacing and Khrushchev, being a man of temperament, had a
                    way of occasionally adopting a menacing posture.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>So that was the atmosphere of that winter. We had seen in the summer of 1957 a
                    sort of benign face of the Soviet system in the form of the First Moscow Youth
                    Festival, where they had really gone all out to make Moscow appear the capital
                    of the Socialist, and not only the Socialist but the non-capitalist world, and
                    it was heavily oriented towards the third world. There were a lot of Africans,
                    and Asians and some Latin Americans there. It really looked like a bid to
                    establish a Communist movement as the leader of the underprivileged of the earth
                    which would eventually encircle the small developed societies grouped around the
                    United States and Europe.</p>
                <p>It was run, for Russia, in a very open way. Russian young people had an
                    opportunity that they never had before to meet all these people and to talk
                    freely to them, pretty much. That really blew their minds. So in a way, it had a
                    reverse effect.</p>
                <p>I had a chance to experience that because I had a rather unusual experience in
                    that year of 1957-58. In the early fall of 1957 the Embassy got a telegram from
                    the Department saying, “A couple of Russian diplomats have applied to George
                    Washington University.” This was the first time that had happened. The
                    Department's general message was: It probably is a healthy thing and we don't
                    have any real way of obstructing that. Washington is not a closed city. George
                    Washington is not a closed university so if they pay the tuition...what do we
                    do? But we want to keep things reciprocal. We want to say to the Russians,
                    “Yeah, sure those guys can go there, but that means there has to be access to
                    Moscow University for some of our diplomats.”</p>
                <p>So I raised my hand. I didn't want to spend all my time reading the newspapers. I
                    volunteered to go to Moscow University. I had an idea what I might want to do
                    there because I had made some inquiries during the Youth Festival about the
                    history faculty and I had identified a course which I thought sounded quite
                    innocuous and would not frighten anybody that I was taking this course.</p>
                <p>We sent a note to the Foreign Ministry saying that Second Secretary John Baker
                    wants to apply to Moscow University and we would appreciate the support and
                    cooperation of the Ministry. Eventually, and it took them about a month to deal
                    with this unusual idea, they gave me the go ahead and I went to the University
                    and saw the Dean and was allowed to attend this one course which was called,
                    “History of the Soviet Union in the Feudal Period.” What it really was was a
                    history of the different peoples of the Soviet Union, their respective feudal
                    areas, but they didn't want to say history of Russia because that would be too
                    great Russia. It was a history mostly of Russia but also some lectures on some
                    of the other nationalities from about 800 AD down to the beginning of the 19th
                    century. The professor was fairly good. I went there once a week. They wouldn't
                    give me a student pass because they didn't want me roaming around the buildings,
                    but they would let me in on my own recognizance every Friday morning and I would
                    attend this two-hour lecture.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The students immediately identified me as an American and in the wake of the
                    Youth Festival they thought the fact that I was at the University must make me
                    fair game, that maybe I was some kind of an American leftist, or what have you.
                    I fairly soon identified myself as to what I was and what I was doing. That
                    cooled some of them, but not all of them, particularly not those who were
                    organizing the history faculty's basketball team. I am about 6'4” and played
                    basketball in school and at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, so I agreed
                    to play as long as there was no objection by the administration. So I went out
                    and practiced for about a month with the history faculty's basketball team and
                    got to know these young guys. Partied a little bit with them. Even had some of
                    them come over to my house and listen to records. Sometimes when we got an
                    American hockey team or basketball team in town I would get a few extra tickets.
                    So in a fairly innocuous way I developed a set of acquaintances there which was
                    interesting. Obviously they had no secrets they could share with me other than
                    their personal lives, but it gave me an insight into the society which was
                    unusual.</p>
                <p>Eventually the Dean told me that I couldn't play basketball for the history
                    faculty. Clearly I was a revisionist influence on the court! It was put on the
                    fairly legitimate grounds that I wasn't a full time student. I kept up these
                    connections but over the winter the anti-revisionist campaign developed and
                    penetrated the University and I began to be increasingly isolated. The people
                    who I had been friendly with in the fall began to tell me that it was not going
                    to be healthy for them to continue to chat with me.</p>
                <p>I had been going to parties occasionally over at the Lenin Hills dorms. Of
                    course, these were never parties in the rooms of Russian students who would be
                    compromised by that. It was all set up so that the hosts would be Egyptians or
                    Syrians, who were very much in vogue at that time and seemed to be willing to
                    stage interminable parties as long as anybody else would provide the vodka. I
                    was barely turning 30 and a lot of these students were in their middle twenties
                    and this was a cheerful and interesting experience. Obviously I was being
                    surveyed all this time and therefore the people who were talking to me
                    eventually were contacted and told to lay off. So by the late winter I wasn't
                    seeing a whole lot of these guys going to class. In May I went on leave to
                    London with my wife and while we were in England, the Embassy contacted me and
                    called me and told me that I had been thrown out of the Soviet Union and
                    couldn't go back. This got a little press coverage. There was protest by the US
                    Embassy. The Charg�, Dick Davis, went in and demanded an explanation. They said
                    that I had violated the norms of diplomatic behavior. Dick said, “What norms had
                    he violated to make sure we don't violate it again?” They said, “Ask Mr. Baker
                    to search his conscience.”</p>

                <p>BAKER: So I have been searching my conscience since 1958 as to what norms I might
                    have violated. But clearly the norms I violated would not be violable norms in
                    any normal country. I was simply getting more exposure to the Soviet citizenry
                    than was convenient for the authorities and they finally wanted to put a stop to
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it is almost an exquisite ballet of tic for tat. Did a

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. I don't know to this day whether this was in response to my being
                    kicked out or whether this particular Soviet diplomat had been identified and
                    was known by the Soviets to be about to be thrown out when they threw me out, so
                    that they could make it look like a retaliation. Subsequently, on one or two
                    occasions later in my career when we tried to test the waters as to whether I
                    could return on another assignment, the answer always was, “Yeah, you can return
                    but only if one of ours gets to return.” Since most of the Soviet diplomats who
                    were thrown out here were for espionage, that deal was never made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for your personal reaction and maybe
                        those around you, after all you had devoted a great deal of time to your
                        Russian training and all and to go there for such a short time and be told
                        “no more,” careerwise this is sort of a blow isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, I thought it was quite a blow. A blow from several respects. I had
                    been abroad just two years, one year in Germany and one in Russia, and I had
                    hoped to be abroad at least five years in a couple of assignments and get
                    through the period while we were having young children and use some of the good
                    help you could get overseas. But when I dropped suddenly onto the hands of the
                    personnel system they couldn't drop me into another appropriate European
                    assignment, so I was brought back to the States. That was not very convenient
                    because I had a young son and another on the way.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I was dropped into an assignment which didn't look all that promising
                    from a career standpoint. But, it turned out that I was able to make something
                    of it that was kind of interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the assignment? You served in Washington from
                        1958-60.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. I served in the Bureau of Public Affairs and at that time it was
                    something called the Office of Policy Coordination. That office did several
                    things. It tried to coordinate policy speeches throughout the government that
                    were on foreign affairs. I didn't do much of that. The other thing was to try to
                    coordinate public affairs events, programs that related to the Communist world
                    and I did quite a lot of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>And thirdly, it had a relationship to some of the programs of the Central
                    Intelligence Agency that were being carried out at that time with youth
                    movements around the world. In 1968 “Ramparts” exposed...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A magazine sort of from the left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: ...all this, in particular the fact that the National Students Association
                    of the United States had been in touch with and in some cases collaborated with
                    CIA programs aimed towards politically significant student groups abroad.
                    Running this program in CIA were several former National Students Association
                    leaders. I was the liaison in the State Department for that.</p>
                <p>One of the things they wanted to do was to impact the first Communist Youth
                    Festival that was going to be staged outside the Communist Bloc, in Vienna. So
                    in 1959—them had these things every two years—there was a Youth Festival in
                    Vienna. There was a certain interest developed in that and a certain program
                    that would assure that the American presence at that Festival would not only be
                    selected left-wingers and fellow travelers, but would get some real normal
                    Americans there. So a group was spun out of the National Students Association to
                    do that. A rather interesting person agreed to lead that group to the Festival,
                    Gloria Steinem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the historical record you might explain who she
                        is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Gloria Steinem subsequently became one of the leaders of the feminist
                    movement in the United States, as well as a successful magazine editor. She was
                    a very intelligent woman with a lot of personal charm. She did a bang-up job at
                    this effort. I was sort of the interface with it.</p>
                <p>I did other things in that job. For example, I went around the country with the
                    Khrushchev visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came to visit Eisenhower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. I looked after the Soviet press accompanying Khrushchev. And I went
                    around the country with the first delegation of Soviet writers that came here,
                    which was an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>I drafted a speech for Nixon when he opened the American Exhibit in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, this was the kitchen debate with Khrushchev.
                        Nixon was Vice President at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BAKER: The speech he made at the opening of that exhibition was one I worked on
                    and I briefed him at his home before he went over there. And I wrote one of the
                    speeches that Eisenhower would have made had he gone to Russia in return for the
                    Khrushchev visit, but the Gary Powers U2 spy plane event blew that. The speech
                    was published at Columbia but never made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Soviet press corps and all
                        when they came to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: It was kind of pathetic. One of the things we wanted to do since we had
                    all these newsmen and they were going around the country, was to get them into
                    individual encounters that might relate to their particular readership. If it
                    was an agricultural paper, we would try to set up interviews with people in the
                    agricultural area, etc. We offered them these various ancillary opportunities
                    but their only interest at that time was to stay close to their press briefing
                    officer. Khrushchev had a competent press briefer and there was Khrushchev's
                    son-in-law who was kind of an obstreperous guy, Alex Adzubey. Those were the
                    people who they wanted to get the Party line from so that they would know what
                    to write. So the whole business of trying to expose them more broadly to the
                    country and therefore their readership didn't really take because they didn't
                    have the latitude or imagination to pick up on it. But it was an opportunity to
                    participate in that sort of barnstorming trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our impression of Khrushchev at that time? Was he
                        a dangerous person, someone with whom we could deal, was he an elemental
                        force or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I think he was all those things. He was somebody with whom you could deal,
                    but he was also dangerous in the sense that he was sort of mercurial, and he was
                    an elemental force, a very earthy guy, rather crude in many respects. He fairly
                    grubby jokes and poked his finger in your chest and banged his shoe on the
                    lectern in the UN. He was not a smooth and polished chief of government or chief
                    of state. This was partly his downfall because some of the more traditional
                    types in the leadership eventually felt it was too dangerous to have a
                    mercurial, elemental force of that kind loose in one of the most powerful
                    countries at the very top level. And, as you know, he was accused of adventurism
                    and all.</p>
                <p>The whole Cuban exercise was a fairly dangerous plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Cuban Missile Crisis in October, 1962. It was THE real
                        confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States.</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BAKER: So, he was capable of that kind of risky business. But on the other hand,
                    compared to his peers he was a force for reform in the Soviet system. In fact,
                    Gorbachev, when he finally got around to trying to do things harked back to that
                    and pulled back into the picture some of the people who had worked with
                    Khrushchev on those partial reforms. Khrushchev never wanted to abandon
                    Communism, but he wanted to make it work better and he thought he had some ideas
                    as to how to do that. They were obviously ideas that stepped on a lot of
                    people's toes and perhaps broke their rice bowls, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another figure you met and obviously came involved with
                        was Nixon. Here you are a relatively junior officer briefing the Vice
                        President. How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I went out to his house here in the NW area. At that time there wasn't a
                    Vice Presidential mansion, he had his own house. He had one or two other people
                    with him. One was a cleric, I think, from Georgetown who he had asked to give
                    him some ideas as well. He received me in a very gracious way, obviously trying
                    to put me at ease. He asked me questions and seemed to listen to what I was
                    saying when I answered them. It was not an intimidating encounter in any way. I
                    felt that I was doing something useful and being heard out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last thing on this period. With these encounters, did
                        you feel that the CIA was kind of nudging or pushing you concerning their
                        backing of National Students Association?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, I thought what they were doing was generally in the US interest. There
                    has been discussion since that time as to whether that sort of thing had to be
                    done clandestinely. Now, of course, you have organizations like the National
                    Endowment for Democracy which does very much those same kinds of things but it
                    is all overt. I guess my mind set was that for some of those things it is more
                    comfortable all around if they are covert. I guess the most obvious extreme of
                    all of this is when you have a diplomatic mission in Managua and you are
                    supporting the Contras who are trying to overthrow the government to which you
                    have got accreditation. If you are doing all that right out in the open, it
                    seems to me, a little bizarre.</p>
                <p>One of the things that was being done at that time, which I think was
                    constructive...the National Students Association was bringing over here some of
                    the leaders of the Algerian Youth Movement. At that time, the Algerian War was
                    still on. The French government looked rather askance at the idea that some of
                    these young leaders who were on the other side of the barricades were coming to
                    the United States and being well received by student organizations. As it turned
                    out, the war ended a year or two later and these people became the leaders of
                    Algeria and we had through this program a certain link to them. The National
                    Student Association couldn't carry out a program like that without help and they
                    got it, but it was not overt. It was quiet help which helped to establish a new
                    link which was valuable for the future. It would have been an embarrassing
                    diplomatic situation had it been overt.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Today is November 23, 1992 and this is a continuing interview with John A. Baker,
                    Jr.</p>
                <p>BAKER: I recall that I was about to leave for Italy when we ended our last
                    discussion. There was one particular aspect of my tour in Italy, maybe two,
                    which might be worth commenting on.</p>
                <p>My job there was in the political section. I was a second secretary. My job was
                    to look after the left side of the Italian political spectrum. The left side
                    included rather substantially the Communist Party of Italy, which at that time
                    had about a quarter of the vote and a corresponding number of seats in
                    parliament. The Socialist Party, headed by Nenni, had up until the mid-fifties,
                    the Hungarian Revolution, been rather tight with the Communists in a sort of
                    common front. They had about 10-12 percent of the vote. Then there were the
                    Social Democrats headed by Saragat, a small party that had broken from the
                    Socialists back in the forties. They broke over the issue of working with the
                    Communists. They were people who wanted to support a Social Democratic outlook,
                    but not to team up with the Communists the way the rest of the Socialist did.
                    Then there was a Republican Party headed by Ugo LaMaifa, who was quite a
                    seasoned politician and expert on budgetary and financial matters in the
                    parliament. So those were the parties I looked after.I also had to look after
                    the far right of the spectrum which were the monarchists and the neo-Fascists. I
                    didn't really spend a lot of time on them because they weren't in the
                    government. They didn't represent a very dynamic or growing force in politics
                    and they didn't seem to represent any threat either to public order or to
                    American interests. If they came around and wanted to see somebody in the
                    Embassy, I was the guy to talk to, but I didn't really spend a lot of time
                    cultivating them.</p>
                <p>I spent most of my time with the Republicans and the Social Democrats and the
                    Socialists. Not the Communists because at that time you were advised not to have
                    direct contacts with the Communist Party in Italy. The philosophy there was that
                    if the American Embassy developed an overt relationship there with that party it
                    would give it greater respectability as a democratic player than was considered
                    to be justified or wise. So I had to gather most of my information on the
                    Communist Party from reading their press and from talking to Italian experts on
                    the Communist Party who wrote in journals and to talk with Socialists and Social
                    Democratic politicians. Some of them were ex-Communists and had experience in
                    the party and knowledge of the individuals in it.</p>
                <p>That was the kind of job I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For somebody looking at this and see “cultivate” could you
                        explain what a political officer with an assignment to report on the left
                        wing in Italy, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BAKER: That's a good question. When you go in there and have that job like this
                    your predecessor, who has been handling those contacts, often will have an
                    occasion before he leaves at which he introduces you to the people that he
                    thinks are valuable and informative and interested in having a contact with the
                    United States. That is one way. The other thing you do is read the press and if
                    you see an interesting article by a journalist or politician, you call him up
                    and say, “That's a very interesting article you wrote. I would like to stop by
                    if you have time and talk to you about it.” Usually that is a little bit
                    flattering and they say, “Yes, that will be very nice.” You then arrange to meet
                    with him or have a drink or take him out to lunch and that leads, you hope, at
                    least to an acquaintance and perhaps to a friendship.</p>
                <p>Of course, one of the things that you always have in your quiver is the potential
                    of a Leader Grant program. The United States has a fine program that the USIA
                    runs. Italian politicians took advantage of that program when they were selected
                    and I think some of them felt that if they got to know someone and had a good
                    relationship with the Embassy it might result eventually in an invitation to the
                    Leader Grant program, and sometimes it did.</p>
                <p>So that, plus the fact that Italian politicians generally are quite
                    approachable...they are not inclined to put you off and regard you as
                    interlopers as the politicians of some other countries. The United States had a
                    very strong standing in Italy. It is quite influential in Italy. So if you were
                    representing the American Embassy in Italy, mostly they would be inclined to
                    talk with you. Provided you got on top of the language, there wasn't great
                    difficulty in establishing contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that always interested me in the
                        Embassy's reporting on politics...we are talking now about the 1960-63
                        period...going from 1950 up until the end of the seventies, the basic
                        combination of political parties and their relative standing didn't change a
                        great deal. The Christian Democrats were running things with some help from
                        some of the more moderate parties. The Communist Party had their quarter to
                        a third percent. Yet we seem to report on the minuet that seemed to be going
                        on within the Italian government. Did you ever feel that this was nice but
                        to what avail our reporting on the Italians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: You are leading up to the principal issue of that period which took most
                    of my attention. There were two issues that I was concerned with. One was the
                    growth of the Italian Communist Party. Was it growing, why and where? Had it
                    recovered from the pasting it took because of the Soviet Union's intervention in
                    Budapest in the fifties? That was one question. Were they, so to speak, on the
                    march in spite of the fact that you were having the beginnings of the Italian
                    economic miracle?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The other issue was this, if the Communists were advancing and if the Christian
                    Democratic Party was not gaining ground, would the democratic center of the
                    spectrum get dangerously thin. You had the four parties—the Christian Democrats,
                    the Social Democrats, the Republicans and the Liberal Party, which was liberal
                    in the conservative economic sense and not wanting too much government in
                    business, etc., but not being clerical...that was their difference with the
                    Christian Democrats, they were not linked to the Church. Those four parties had
                    basically been running Italy since 1947, but together their majority in
                    parliament had been shrinking from somewhere over 60 percent down to something
                    getting close to the low 50s. So the question was, how or whether you should try
                    to enlarge the democratic camp by bringing in the Socialist Party. That was the
                    real debate of the early sixties. It was called the apertura a sinistra, the
                    opening to the left. Should those four parties open to the left and bring the
                    Socialist Party into the game? And then the question was on what terms should
                    the Socialist Party come into the democratic center game? What would have to be
                    given up or changed for them to come into the game?</p>
                <p>Into that equation came the problem of how serious the Communist growth was. If
                    you saw it as serious, then you were more strongly motivated to deal with the
                    Socialists. If you felt it was stable and would decline gradually because of the
                    economic growth of Italy, then you would say, “Why should we yield any ground to
                    these wavering Socialists, half of whom still want to be close to the Communists
                    and half of whom seem to be ready to cooperate with the center?”</p>
                <p>The Embassy, itself, was not of one mind on the matter. Nor was the
                    administration in Washington. The impression one had in Washington was that the
                    White House, and particularly Arthur Schlesinger, who was in the Kennedy White
                    House, felt quite attracted by the idea of the opening of the left. Schlesinger
                    even sort of idealized it as some kind of Italian New Deal, which was one of his
                    favorite historical subjects. The Department of State, because of its concern
                    with the solidity of Italian foreign policy and commitment to NATO seemed to
                    have some reservations about whether it would be weakened by bringing the
                    Socialists into the government or into some relationship with the
                    government.</p>
                <p>In the Embassy you also had the different views. The Ambassador, Frederick
                    Reinhardt, was sort of holding his peace on the matter to see how things
                    developed. He was quite careful about taking any posture on that. His deputy,
                    Outerbridge Horsey, was automatically opposed to the idea of the opening to the
                    left. He was a rather conservative man of Catholic persuasion and seemingly
                    closer to those parts of the Christian Democratic Party who had a lot of
                    reservations about it. The senior guy in the political section who followed the
                    Italian political affairs, George Lister, who is still around, I think, in the
                    Department or as a consultant to the Department, was strongly in favor and felt
                    that it was something that should be encouraged and supported. So one suddenly
                    found that one was in a fairly charged atmosphere where one's orientation on
                    this issue was being closely monitored, not in any spooky way, but people would
                    just be waiting to see how you lined up when that matter came into
                    discussion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your Eastern European background as far as assignment
                        go make you a suspect among the Western Europeanists there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Not really, because there had been a tradition of having the person who
                    monitored the Italian Communist Party be a person who had had experience in the
                    Communist world as a diplomat. My predecessors in that function had also come
                    out of an experience with international Communism, rather than with Western
                    European politics. So I was not an aberration in having that background. But I
                    fairly early on perceived that the Italian Communist Party was quite a special
                    animal and had its own traditions. It was rather over towards the less
                    revolutionary side of the international Communist movement and was trying
                    domestically to present a non-revolutionary face in order not to lose and
                    perhaps regain the links with the Socialist Party and to restrain—to break, if
                    possible—the trend towards pulling the Socialists toward the center.</p>
                <p>I think the Communists perceived that should the Socialists in effect join the
                    center then they would be lost to a future return to the leftist front, so to
                    speak. So they played down their “revolutionary” side and their links to Moscow.
                    Nevertheless, they still had to wave the revolutionary banner every so often on
                    the required occasions.</p>
                <p>They were still going to those international Communist movement gatherings which
                    took place in the sixties. They often occurred at the time of the congresses of
                    the East European parties. One of them occurred in late 1960 at the Romanian
                    Communist Party Congress. The Italian Communists came back from there with the
                    news that there had been a serious altercation between the Chinese and the
                    Soviet parties. It had taken the form of taking a different stand with respect
                    to the Albanian party. But the Italian Communists were not deceived that this
                    was all directed at the Albanian party and understood that this was a proxy way
                    of illustrating a developing rift.</p>
                <p>That was one of the early signs of the Sino-Soviet rift. We gathered information
                    on it and reported it in some detail to the State Department, but it did seem to
                    us that there was some time before that was taken seriously as a significant
                    change in the international Communist movement.By way of illustrating the
                    function of the Italian Communist Party, I think it is interesting that the news
                    about that came out largely and first through the Italian Communist Party,
                    which, like other Italians, tended to be more talkative and less secretive than
                    other parties in the movement.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Anyway, by about 1962 it became clear that the leader of the Christian Democrats,
                    Aldo Moro, was getting ready to make a gradual opening to the left and since the
                    Italian governments were falling and being reconstituted fairly frequently then,
                    there was an occasion in the fall of 1962 to construct a government which, while
                    not having the Socialist Party in it, would depend on the Socialist Party for
                    parliamentary support. This would be a government of the Christian Democrats,
                    Social Democrats and the Republicans and with the parliamentary support of the
                    Socialists.</p>
                <p>But as this began to take shape, alarm bells rang in several places because of
                    the concern that this was the first step in bringing the Socialists into the
                    government. There was a lot of concern about whether the commitment to NATO
                    would have to be somehow softened because the Socialist had taken a posture
                    critical of NATO or whether the deal would basically be made over domestic
                    issues. Finally, it came down to the point as to whether the Embassy would
                    recommend using its rather good connections with strong parts of the Christian
                    Democratic Party to actually make a strong advisory against such a combination.
                    In effect, go to Moro or to people who would influence Moro and say, “Don't do
                    this. This is dangerous. It is dangerous to Italy. It is dangerous to the
                    alliance and perhaps dangerous to the American-Italian relationship.”</p>
                <p>So that issue was laid out in a meeting that took place in the Embassy at which I
                    was present along with the head of the political section and the station chief
                    and various other players.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the CIA attitude, at least in country, towards
                        the Communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, at that time the Agency had a fairly active set of activities in
                    support of different programs in the democratic center parties, particularly the
                    Christian Democratic Party. So they were following things very closely and had
                    their own set of contacts with Italian politicians. It was sometimes awkward for
                    some of us on the overt side. The inclination of the station chief was like the
                    inclination of the Minister, to be concerned and cautious about the opening to
                    the left, and to be ready to use assets to obstruct it. So the general
                    discussion was about whether or not one should do that.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Well, by that time I had come to the conclusion that Italy was in a fairly good
                    state of economic development. The leader of its largest party, the Christian
                    Democrats, was an experienced politician, a very judicious man. We weren't
                    talking about a struggling democracy in the wake of World War II, we were
                    talking about a system which had been operational for 17 years after World War
                    II. So I offered the view that I thought we would be taking a heavy
                    responsibility on our selves to try to guide the Italian choice in this matter
                    at this stage in their development. And furthermore, based on contacts I had
                    with the Socialist Party, I did not think they would seriously condition Italy's
                    foreign policy. I thought that they would choose to make their impact and their
                    price for coming into the arrangement more in the domestic area where the
                    concerns of their electorate were more strong. I took the view “Let's not be
                    cheerleaders for the opening to the left, but let's not try to block it either.
                    Let's treat the Italian political leadership as if they had come of age and they
                    have to make their choices and go down with them or win with them,
                    whatever.”</p>
                <p>I am not aware of everything that happened after that meeting or of everything
                    that might have or might not have been done, but I do know that the Christian
                    Democratic Party did go ahead and make their deal. Basically the price of their
                    deal was the nationalization of the Italian electric industry. It probably
                    wasn't a helluva good idea, but it didn't cost the NATO alliance or American
                    national interest a whole lot. And since that time, of course, the Socialist
                    Party the following year came into the government and its leaders began to have
                    ministerial posts and in the next 20 or 30 years it became just another left of
                    center party in Italy, occasionally holding the prime ministership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling, particularly because you were
                        coming from outside...people who serve in Italy tend to come back, and back
                        and back. I was Consul General in Naples and was surrounded by old Italian
                        hands both in the Consulate and the Embassy. Did you have the feeling that
                        we were taking much more of a propriety view and almost patronizing view of
                        the Italian body politics than say in other European countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I hadn't served in other Western European countries so I couldn't make
                    that comparison, but it was my impression that we were pretty heavily engaged.
                    It probably went back to the fact that we were the principal liberating power in
                    Italy at the end of the war. We were the government that weighed in very heavily
                    through Italian-American organizations and the Church, etc. in 1948 when it
                    looked like there was a real threat that there might be a Socialist-Communist
                    victory right in the period of the Berlin Blockade and all that. So we did weigh
                    in heavily and I think ever since that period we had a sort of structure for
                    being in a somewhat patronizing position and a lot of Italians were not only
                    used to it but even played into it. Their politicians wanted the support and
                    blessing of the American power. But it did seem to me by the time I got there in
                    1960 that this was perhaps more than it should be at that stage in history.
                    That's I think why when the chips came on the table, I reacted in the way I did
                    in that discussion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other issues that you were involved with? How did we
                        view Italy as part of NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: One of the things that was going on at that time...I wasn't involved in it
                    because I wasn't handling relationships with the Foreign Ministry. The chief of
                    the political section did that. But there was this ill-fated effort to create
                    the multilateral force. The idea was that there would be some kind of jointly
                    managed ships that would sail around the periphery of Europe armed with
                    intermediate missilery, etc. That would be a way of creating a nuclear counter
                    threat to the Russian bloc that would not just be an American one. Well, that
                    never did fly. It had a fair amount of criticism on the left of the Italian
                    spectrum and it was the kind of issue that, of course, was particularly
                    uncomfortable for the Socialists, because they were not only lukewarm towards
                    NATO but they were strongly anti-nuclear. So waving that issue around was
                    something that tended to put something of a strain on the process of bringing
                    the Socialists into the central area of the democratic spectrum.</p>
                <p>I felt relieved that I did not have to play a particularly active role in hawking
                    that particular proposal.</p>

                    Italian Communists and the opening to the left were the two aspects of my three
                    years there that stand out in my mind.</p>

                    Pedersen, who had been around the Mission for many years and was quite well
                    versed in UN affairs. He assigned issues to the political officers and I was
                    assigned the Cyprus issue, which within a few months suddenly broke into flames
                    in Nicosia because the Greek Cypriots were challenging the regime of the

                <p>BAKER: Yes. So there was violence in Nicosia and fighting between the Greeks and
                    the Turks. This finally came to the Security Council in the winter of 1963-64.
                    We had a series of meetings the result of which was the creation of the
                    peacekeeping force on Cyprus which is there to this day. That was an interesting
                    process because I think it was the first occasion on which the Security Council
                    turned to the non-permanent members to take a lead in negotiating a solution
                    which would be put before the Council. The British couldn't get into it because
                    they were the former colonial power...but we perceived that the more we got into
                    it as the central broker, the more we would tend to East-Westernize the problem,
                    which didn't seem to be very helpful in the sense that it wasn't an East-West
                    problem anyway, it was a Greek-Turk problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: East-West, this was between the Soviet Union and the
                        US?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. So if the proposal that came forward in the Council looked like an
                    American proposal, it would probably be a good way to invite Soviet opposition
                    and maybe even veto. So the Norwegian and Brazilian members of the Council, both
                    of whom had rather competent ambassadors, took the lead on that. Charlie Yost,
                    who was Adlai Stevenson's deputy, rather adroitly encouraged them along the way.
                    I served as sort of a go-between trying to keep up the process and putting
                    messages and ideas into the process and, of course, reporting voluminously to
                    the Department about the procedure.</p>
                <p>So, as a result of that I became quite well acquainted with all the players in
                    that drama. Not Makarios, himself, because he stayed in Cyprus, but his Foreign
                    Minister, Kyprianou; his ambassador in New York, who was an odd old fellow named
                    Rossides; Rossides' young, activist assistant, Andrew Jakovides, who is now the
                    Cypriot Ambassador in the United Nations, the Cypriot players, Clarides of the
                    Greek-Cypriots, Denktash, who is still the leader of the Turkish-Cypriots, the
                    Turkish and Greek Ambassadors, Erelp and Bitsios, and the Secretary General of
                    the Turkish Foreign Ministry, Bayulken, who took an active interest in the
                    matter. So I have a very vivid memory of all those players and their
                    interactions and their rather high degree of emotion over this whole
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Greek lobby in the United States a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: To the degree that the Greek lobby weighed in...they were accustomed to
                    weighing in in Washington. The Greek lobby was not all over us in New York. I
                    didn't really sense from the kind of instructions we got that we were
                    particularly leaning towards the Greek point of view on this. The Greek
                    government was pretty careful in that period. They were not 100% behind what
                    Makarios was doing. They were concerned that the people who were calling for
                    Enosis, which was the union of Cyprus to Greece, would create a real nasty
                    situation between them and the Turks and they weren't sure they were really up
                    for that. So they tended to regard Makarios with a little bit of hesitation, not
                    as a 100% ally, but somebody who was looking out for Makarios.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With solid reason. What was your impression of Adlai
                        Stevenson as the head of your delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I arrived there the fall of 1963 and I worked for the Mission under his
                    leadership until he died July, 1965. But I was one of a number of officers in
                    the political section. I didn't work regularly in direct contact with Stevenson.
                    When the Cyprus issue or other issues that I handled were in the Security
                    Council, I worked for him and wrote drafts of his speeches and was always
                    impressed on how he could turn a rather pedestrian draft into a work of
                    considerable artistry. It was rather humbling to even try to write a first draft
                    for somebody like Stevenson. I was always impressed by the amount of effort he
                    put in to what I might have regarded a fairly routine presentation in the
                    Council. But for him there wasn't any such thing as a routine presentation and
                    he would want it to be a quality presentation, and it was. He knew how to make a
                    silk purse out of a sow's ear.</p>
                <p>So I really respected that capability and I respected and enjoyed his sense of
                    humor when he chaired meetings and when he entertained visiting chiefs of state.
                    He had dinners for them at his apartment at the Waldorf. I was present at some
                    of those and he was remarkably gracious and witty on those occasions. I
                    particularly remember one he had for King Hussein of Jordan at which I was
                    present. He really did those things with great style.</p>
                <p>He wasn't engaged as heavily in the sort of nitty-gritty negotiation of issues as
                    the rest of us were, it seemed to me. And certainly nowhere near the degree that
                    his successor, Arthur Goldberg, was. I think he relied heavily on Charlie Yost
                    and Francis Plimpton, who was another one of the deputies there, to craft those
                    positions and direct the strategy and manage the work of the Mission with
                    respect to the work across the street. He would be the spokesman for it. But I
                    didn't feel that he was always personally engaged in the diplomacy. Maybe that
                    was because of the time of life it was for him, or also of the things that he
                    felt he could do best, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about dealing with the other delegations?
                        Did we make a difference as far as our approaches or were these delegations
                        for the most part responding to instructions from home on important
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That is a complicated issue. Often what you needed to do is to find out
                    where key delegations might be inclining and if you felt that they didn't have
                    much latitude, in terms of their own instructions, then you would have to ask
                    the State Department, if you thought it was important enough, to weigh in their
                    capitals to see if we could get their instructions changed. The major
                    governments tended to work on instructions from their own countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The growing number of third world countries there often didn't have instructions
                    from capitals and their tendency was to follow the lead of the leading
                    non-aligned countries there. That became even more marked in the seventies when
                    the non-aligned movement became even larger and more organized and more active,
                    but it was already apparent in the mid-sixties.</p>
                <p>It was apparent, for example, when the Cypriots, who figured that out, brought
                    the Cypriot issue into the General Assembly in 1965. What the Cypriots were
                    getting in the Security Council was more or less a recognition of an effort to
                    work their way out of the Treaty of Nicosia, which had established a certain
                    Greek-Turk balance on the whole thing. What they really wanted to do, what
                    Makarios wanted to do, was to change that regime, to say that that was a
                    colonial imposition, that the Cypriots had signed the Treaty of Nicosia as a
                    colony, not as an independent nation, and that, therefore, just as the rest of
                    the formerly colonial world they had to take the steps towards the rest of their
                    independence. They wanted the General Assembly to recognize their concept of
                    what self-determination was for Cyprus. So they appealed to the third world to
                    support them in a General Assembly resolution which would try to overturn in
                    effect the Treaty of Nicosia.</p>
                <p>That was the subject of a considerable amount of lobbying and campaigning in the
                    General Assembly in 1965, the result of which was a somewhat equivocal one for
                    the Cypriots. I think they won their resolution, but not with sufficient margin
                    to really make it very operational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues that you were primarily
                        concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: You were asking me about Stevenson. In the Stevenson period. I worked on
                    the Cyprus issue and the issue of Yemen, where the Egyptians were conducting a
                    considerable intervention and where we were trying to create a UN presence that
                    would untangle all that, and eventually did. During General Assemblies I was
                    engaged on the issue in the special political committee of apartheid and the
                    annual debate in that same committee on Palestine. So I spent a lot of time in
                    the fall on those issues and I spent a lot of time in the Security Council on
                    Cyprus and Yemen. In the process I got quite well acquainted with Ralph Bunche
                    because he was the guru of peacekeeping, and his deputy, Brian Urquhart. They
                    were the people who I consulted with on all the operational aspects of
                    peacekeeping as they emerged from the Security Council.</p>
                <p>But my life and activity at the US Mission changed quite radically when Stevenson
                    died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He died in 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. One of his close advisors at the Mission was a fellow by the name of
                    David Guyer. He, among other things, was looking after the Kashmir issue, which
                    was rather quiescent. When Stevenson died, David left the Mission and this issue
                    was dropped in my package with nobody giving it a whole lot of attention or to
                    Indo Pakistani problems.</p>
                <p>Then on September 1, 1965, the Pakistanis attacked across the border into India
                    early in the morning. And September 1 was the day that Arthur Goldberg, having
                    been hauled off the Supreme Court by Lyndon Johnson, was due to arrive to
                    replace deceased Adlai Stevenson. And September 1 was the first day of
                    September, which turned out to be the month that the United States had to be
                    Chairman of the Security Council.</p>
                <p>So here comes Arthur Goldberg, early in the morning of his first day, smack into
                    the chair of the Security Council on an issue which I, having inherited it about
                    a month before, was required to backstop him. So I spent a very intense couple
                    of months in the Security Council day and night with Arthur Goldberg, on the
                    phone to the Department, sending myriad of messages to Chester Bowles in India
                    and to our Embassy in Pakistan. Arthur was not like Stevenson in that regard. He
                    got into the guts and strategy and negotiations from the very outset, and sort
                    of hung on like a bulldog. He would think about and worry about and maneuver
                    these issues both within the American government and in the Security Council in
                    an extraordinarily energetic way, which, of course, put considerable demands and
                    challenges on my time.</p>
                <p>It was extremely interesting and educational and I developed a close relationship
                    with Arthur Goldberg. He promoted my boss to be one of the deputy ambassadors
                    and promoted me to be chief of the political section, so for the second two
                    years that I was at the Mission, I was engaged across a wide range of issues in
                    direct contact with Arthur Goldberg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Pak-Indian war, one of almost the constants in
                        American post-war relations has been, at least on the Foreign Service point
                        of view, the fact that our Ambassador to India tends to get more Indian than
                        the Indians and the same for our Ambassador in Pakistan. Did you find these
                        men, Chuck Bowles and whoever the other man was, helpful or were they
                        partisans where you really couldn't use them to nudge the government to
                        which they were accredited?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, my recollection is that Bowles was very much more engaged in that
                    way than our Ambassador to Pakistan, whose name I can't remember right now. The
                    messages that came back and forth from New Delhi were more impassioned than
                    through the other channel. On the other hand, there was no lack of passion on
                    the part of the Pakistani Foreign Minister, Mr. Bhutto, who appeared on the
                    scene loaded with emotion and was a great contrast to the rather cool demeanor
                    of the Indian Foreign Minister, Sweran Singh, who came in for the final rounds
                    of negotiation on the cease fire that was finally crafted by Goldberg.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I think Goldberg was at pains to keep in the middle of that one and not to appear
                    to be partisan in any way. I think in a way he would have liked to try to carry
                    the thing on out to the end, but somewhere in that fall the Soviets in the form
                    of Prime Minister Kosygin, offered the good offices of the Soviet Union to try
                    to resolve the conflict. The Pakistanis looked somewhat askance at this because
                    they, with some justification, saw the long Soviet relationship with India might
                    not work to their advantage and I think they rather hoped that Lyndon Johnson
                    and Goldberg would keep an American involvement in that issue.</p>
                <p>But Johnson, apparently, was ready to hand that one off. That resulted in the
                    series of meetings in Tashkent, which finally led to some cooling off of that
                    conflict. I think there was about a month there when I didn't get home at all. I
                    slept in the Mission. There was some bed down in the nurse's office that I would
                    flop on. The meetings of the Security Council kept occurring at odd hours of the
                    night when some temporary cease fire was broken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, telegrams were coming in also from about as far

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. We got a high volume of very highly classified stuff and I was
                    supposed to always be on top of all of it. It was a busy season.</p>
                <p>The other dramatic event of that two years was, of course, the Six Day War. That
                    was in June, 1967, between Israel and basically Egypt. We saw that crisis
                    emerging as the Egyptians moved through the UN force in the Sinai, which the
                    Israelis saw as very threatening. Of course the Israelis were never willing to
                    see the UN force on their side of the border, but it had been sitting ever since
                    1956 on the Egyptian side of the border in the Sinai as a buffer. Nasser more or
                    less moved it aside and took control of the Sharm el Sheikh which was an outpost
                    overlooking the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba leading to Israel's southern port,
                    Elat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was thought that the head of the UN had a major
                        responsibility to end this war, by not procrastinating and stopping this
                        stupid move on the part of Nasser of trying to get the UN force out when
                        Nasser wasn't going to be able to beat the Israelis. What was the feeling
                        within our delegation about the UN role and particularly U Thant's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, his position would have been stronger if that were a force that had
                    been positioned on both sides of the border, but as it was, it was a force that
                    was in place solely on the by your leave of one side, which was Egypt. So at
                    such time as the host country stated that the force was not necessary or should
                    be moved aside, there wasn't a whole lot you could argue about since it was not
                    a green line type of force, it was an in-country force.</p>

                <p>BAKER: You could argue that he should have dragged his feet more, but on legal
                    grounds, because of the circumstances I have described, he had to accede to the
                    host country's position on that force which was not an internationally employed
                    force, and that is something that a lot of people overlooked. Of course the
                    Israelis in complaining about that never acknowledged that they had never agreed
                    to have the force on their side of the line.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much UN action in the aftermath of this
                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The cease-fire was basically negotiated in the Security Council. One could
                    see the terms of the cease-fire changing as the fortunes of war changed. What
                    was remarkable to me, and I have never gotten a whole explanation for it, was
                    that on the evening of May 31, Arthur Goldberg invited senior people from the
                    political section and his deputies to his apartment at the Waldorf and said that
                    he just wanted to have a little meeting to exchange views on the Arab-Israeli
                    crisis. We all came there and spent a couple of hours talking with Arthur about
                    it. About six hours later word came that the Israelis had moved over the line of
                    demarcation into the Sinai. In retrospect, it struck me kind of interesting that
                    Arthur called that meeting at just that time. It almost looked like he was
                    saying, “I want to make sure that all of my guys are in place because something
                    is going to happen.” It has made me wonder in retrospect whether Arthur, who, of
                    course, had very close ties to the Israeli government, had had advance tips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Jewish and a labor leader in the United States and
                        Israel had a Labor government at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: He never acknowledged that he had advance tips but there was just that
                    juxtaposition that made me wonder.</p>
                <p>In the first hours of that war, the Israeli forces met some resistance...the
                    Jordanian forces went in, much to their later regret...and the Arabs in and
                    around the Security Council were on the verge of jubilation. Gradually, as the
                    news of the Israeli breakthrough towards the Suez came through, the whole
                    atmosphere changed and the kind of cease-fire that they had been trying to get
                    they had to give up on.</p>
                <p>So eventually, the kind of cease-fire that Goldberg was working for was worked
                    out. That was essentially a cease-fire in place, not a cease-fire and
                    withdrawal. Then, in those places, the Israelis, who had crossed the Suez Canal
                    to encircle some Egyptian forces, did come back over and the new UN posts were
                    set up along the Suez Canal. So that was the new peacekeeping operation. It
                    wasn't a UNEF anymore, it was a truce observation force along there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Arab delegations? Were you dealing
                        with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I was dealing with them for the whole four years I was there because I was
                    active on the Palestine issue in the special political committee for all four
                    years. In 1965 I was named as chairman of the Palestine Reconciliation
                    Commission. That was a three nation commission that sort of had the
                    oversight...it was us, the Turks and the French... and our only function by the
                    time I got there was the care and preservation of the land records of
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>The idea was that the early resolution passed sometime in the late forties which
                    called for the possibility of return of the Arabs to their homes in Palestine,
                    in Israel, the only way that resolution could ever be carried out would be if
                    somebody kept track of whose land was whose. So we had all these British Mandate
                    records and I guess they are still there to this day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There have been accusations in recent years about West
                        Bank Arabs having trouble proving their claims to bits of land.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, that's right. You see the idea was, according to a 1948 resolution,
                    that you would either get repatriation or compensation. Since it was more and
                    more apparent that the Israelis didn't want to let any of those Arabs repatriate
                    into Israel proper, then the idea was that in whatever ultimate peace agreement
                    you ever had there would have to be compensation and how would you calculate
                    compensation unless one knew who had owned what. So I trust those things are
                    still being carefully guarded because if there ever is a peace settlement in
                    which Israel is recognized as a state that may be one piece of it...that is if
                    Arabs are not allowed to repatriate to their homes in Israel, then they must be
                    compensated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find with the Arab delegations that you were
                        dealing with after this really very shocking defeat as far as the Arabs were
                        concerned, a change in attitude towards the United States because later the
                        story was put out that it was really American planes that were responsible
                        for the initial attack? In fact our relations with most of these governments
                        ceased. How did you find this in the UN?</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BAKER: The UN is an interesting place in that regard because when you work there
                    as a professional diplomat and you are seeing these people everyday in the
                    delegate's lounge and so on, you establish personal relationships and they are
                    closer than in normal diplomatic posts precisely because you are seeing them
                    every day and you really get quite well acquainted with these people. Therefore,
                    even in the worst of circumstances, people don't turn their back on you. Maybe
                    some new diplomat who comes in with some new instruction or his government
                    doesn't have relations with you, you may not get to know. But the people you
                    already know you keep on seeing and they tell you what their government is
                    thinking but won't have any personal animosity about it.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: For me personally not very much and for this reason. When we finished
                    towards the end of June the consideration of the thing in the Security Council
                    there was then a special assembly of the General Assembly that the Arabs called
                    for which was then held. The effort was really to create the basis for some
                    future solution, not just to sit there with a cease-fire and a defeat. So what
                    was started in that assembly was the rather complex negotiation that eventually
                    led to Resolution 242, the land for peace...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The governing one for even today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. And that came out of that assembly. Actually it wasn't concluded
                    until some point during the fall assembly of the General Assembly in November.
                    But we were engaged in those negotiations in support of Arthur Goldberg.</p>
                <p>For me that special General Assembly was sort of my last hurrah at the UN. I was,
                    at that point, pulling out and getting ready for another assignment, so I wasn't
                    around for very much of the aftermath of the Security Council consideration of
                    the Six Day War. I was eagerly wrapping it up to get ready to go to Harvard for
                    a year as a Fellow.</p>

                <p>BAKER: Each year the Department sends a person to the Center for International
                    Affairs Fellows Program and I sort of raised my hand for that because you
                    usually get some kind of mid-career training at the War College or something, so
                    I raised my hand for that one because I thought it would be more interesting. I
                    got nominated for it so I moved off in August and got up to Harvard early
                    September.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yeah, I went to Henry's classes. He was already trying to figure out what
                    might happen in the 1968 elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Henry Kissinger...what was your
                        impression? Obviously he is a very intelligent man but here he was an
                        academic and here you were an experienced diplomat who had been dealing with
                        many of the major problems of American foreign policy. Did you find him too
                        academic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, Henry was, throughout the sixties, on a fairly constant series of
                    plane rides to Washington as a consultant, largely with the Defense Department,
                    but also others. Of course, he was already a consultant to Nelson Rockefeller.
                    He was very much engaged in practical politics. His seminar, which I think was
                    called the National Security Seminar, was in a way an effort to bring the
                    thinking of government leaders to the campus and expose people who might be
                    otherwise too academically lost or engaged to the fairly pragmatic types of
                    decision making that were happening. So I can hardly remember a session of his
                    seminar when he conducted or presented the thesis. Almost every time it would be
                    somebody who he brought up from Washington or sometimes somebody coming through
                    from Europe who would be asked to lay out the thesis. Then he would very sharply
                    go at that presentation to try to probe for any inconsistences or weaknesses or
                    unanswered questions. Sometimes he would slice up the victim a bit. Then he
                    would turnover the carcass to the students who were mostly graduate students and
                    some of us who were Fellows from the Fellows program. It was a fairly large
                    group...40-50 people.</p>
                <p>I was interested in that technique because subsequently, about three years later
                    when I was back in Washington after an assignment in Czechoslovakia, I had
                    occasion to go to the National Security Council, to some of its crisis meetings.
                    It seemed to me that he ran the National Security Council meetings almost the
                    same way. As you know the NSC usually doesn't operate at the Cabinet level, it
                    acts, more often, through an interagency group more or less at the assistant
                    secretary level. I went in the capacity of an Office Director with my Assistant
                    Secretary for European Affairs, Walt Stoessel, to a couple of those sessions.
                    Henry would invariably sort of ask somebody to lay out the problem and, if
                    appropriate, the necessary or appropriate American response to the problem. Then
                    he would start chipping at it and jabbing at it more or less the same way he did
                    in his National Security Seminar. He would refer to me when he caught sight of
                    me as his “old stu-dent'.”</p>

                <p>Today is April 14, 1993 and this is a continuing interview with John A. Baker,
                    Jr. We are really at the point now of the 1968-70 period when you went to Prague
                    as Deputy Chief of Mission. How did you get that assignment?</p>
                <p>BAKER: During the previous year, following a fairly exhausting four years at the
                    US Mission to the UN, I was able to get a mid-career training assignment. Since
                    I had to move some place anyway from Connecticut where I was living I was able
                    to arrange to get assigned to the Center for International Affairs at Harvard as
                    a Fellow rather than go to the War College or some other program. During that
                    year at Harvard, which was a very interesting one I might add, and one during
                    which I attended the famous Henry Kissinger National Security Seminar, I was
                    thinking, of course, of my follow on assignment.</p>
                <p>My strategy was really to get some exposure to the Middle East and I was doing a
                    paper, as one had to do for that program, on Soviet policy in the Middle East in
                    the period leading up to the Six Day War. I thought that might enhance my
                    otherwise rather slim credentials for the Middle East.</p>
                <p>I wrote to our Ambassador in Lebanon, because that is a place that you don't
                    really have to have Arabic to start, I had French, and offered my services as
                    DCM there because I knew the posting of the incumbent was about to end in the
                    summer of 1968. At the same time I also wrote to our Ambassador at Prague, Jake
                    Beam, whom I had known in my initial assignment in Yugoslavia in 1951, where he
                    was at that time Counselor. I didn't know, of course, one never does, whether
                    either one of these would come through.</p>
                <p>But along about March I did get an indication from Ambassador Beam that he would
                    like me to come there and, seizing the bird in the hand, I accepted. About a
                    month later I got a similar offer to go to Lebanon, which by then I had to
                    decline.</p>
                <p>So I quickly signed up for a not too effective Czech language course in Harvard,
                    as I wasn't able to go down to the Foreign Service Institute, and tried to
                    prepare myself to understand what was happening in what was then being described
                    as the Prague Spring. Then I arrived with my family towards the end of June,
                    1968 in Prague as Deputy Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>Right in that very week that I arrived there was published a manifesto entitled,
                    “Two Thousand Words” which was written by an intellectual who was one of the
                    people who was pushing the reform Communist program of Dubcek further and
                    faster. Many intellectuals, both non-Communists and Communists, were
                    enthusiastic about the action program which Dubcek had launched in the spring of
                    1968 which pointed to various economic and political reforms and were urging in
                    this eloquent “Two Thousand Words” a more rapid pace towards real democracy in
                    Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Obviously this piece, along with other things that were happening, began to get
                    reaction in Russia and there would be comments in the Russian press critical of
                    what was regarded as a revisionist, Zionist conspiracy to extract Czechoslovakia
                    from the Socialist family of nations.</p>
                <p>During July there were a number of events that seemed to accelerate the tension
                    between the Czechoslovak leadership and the Warsaw Pact countries. As I recall,
                    one of the events was a meeting which the Warsaw Pact countries held in Warsaw,
                    and they rather belatedly invited the Czechoslovak party leaders to come but the
                    way the meeting was described and couched, sounded very much like a sort of
                    sitting in judgment on what was occurring in Czechoslovakia, and the
                    Czechoslovak leaders declined to be sort of bad boys appearing before their
                    peers or elders in this situation. So they didn't go to Warsaw. As a result, the
                    communique that came out of there was not very much to their liking.
                    Nevertheless, it was meant to stand as a warning to them that their comrades in
                    the Eastern bloc felt they were going too far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time, you were the new boy on the block, these
                        things were happening, how was the Embassy, Beam, but also from the
                        emanations you were getting from our Embassies in Moscow and Warsaw, how
                        were they reading how this thing was going and how did they see the future
                        at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, the Embassy was reading and reporting these reports very closely,
                    and I think quite effectively. We had an excellent political/economic section
                    that was led by an officer named Mark Garrison, who later went on to Moscow in a
                    similar role and was later DCM there. They produced at least one telegraphic
                    report daily on all these events, including a lot of information that we
                    gathered from a growing number of quite candid Czechoslovak contacts, because
                    the whole atmosphere was much less restrictive in the Dubcek, Prague Spring,
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The thrust of these reports was that there was a rising tension between what was
                    happening in Czechoslovakia and what one normally expected as the limits that
                    were placed on what an Eastern European state could be expected to do within the
                    Soviet Bloc. So, I think, those of us who had had experience in Russia, or
                    elsewhere in Eastern Europe, felt that this was a somewhat worrisome situation.
                    As much as we were sympathetic to what Dubcek and others were trying to do, we
                    were obviously concerned as to where that might end.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BAKER: Well, there were some of us who thought that it might be helpful if we
                    were to express a little caution. There was one instance that I recall
                    personally in which I took that view. This occurred about the 5th of August and
                    took place after the famous meetings with the Soviet leadership on the
                    Czechoslovak-Russian border at Cierna and Tisov where almost the entire Soviet
                    Politburo met almost the entire Czechoslovak Politburo. Then there was the
                    subsequent meeting in Bratislava where the other Warsaw Pact countries were
                    summoned to endorse the understandings that were thought to have been reached at
                    Cierna.</p>
                <p>Those two meetings were interpreted by a large part of the world press as the at
                    least temporary reconciliation of the Czechoslovak leadership with the other
                    Communist countries and particularly with the Soviets. People more or less
                    assumed that the Czechoslovak leadership had agreed to take it a little slow and
                    curb some of the more enthusiastic democrats. Nevertheless, the week immediately
                    following that the Czech press carried on almost without change and were
                    publishing articles that dredged up some rather critical periods of Russian
                    pressure on the Czechoslovak republic and incidents that occurred in the late
                    forties that led to the takeover by the Communists.</p>
                <p>About that time a group of American newsmen arrived for a visit and the
                    Ambassador entertained them at lunch and I was invited. There were some Czech
                    newsmen there too. After lunch we went out on the terrace because one could
                    never be sure of what would happen to what one said in the dining room and we
                    talked further with the American and Czechoslovak journalists. I actually raised
                    this issue with one of them and said, “What do you think about this wave of
                    expressive articles occurring right after those two diplomatic meetings? Aren't
                    you concerned as to whether this will stir up people in Russia who are worried
                    about what is happening here?” They said, “We cannot think that way. Once we
                    start thinking that way we will then be guilty of self-censorship. And once we
                    start self-censoring ourselves, we are doing the job of the Soviets and we are
                    undermining the progress towards freedom of expression which we advocate and
                    which we have partially obtained and want to solidify. So we really feel that it
                    would be playing against our interests to curtail, either on our own initiative
                    or on our editors' initiatives, what we are saying.”I remember very clearly the
                    man who said that because I met him a year to two later when he was in
                    exile.After that meeting, the next time I talked to Ambassador Beam I said, “You
                    know these people don't seem to understand that some restraint may be called for
                    at this time. Do you think there is anything that we could usefully do?” He
                    said, “I agree with you, but I don't think it would be appropriate for us to
                    intervene in this matter. The Czechs and Slovaks certainly ought to know the
                    Soviets mentality and the dangers from the Soviet side as well or better than we
                    do. After all they have been raised in that system and that neighborhood. We do
                    not want to become a party to a process of shutting down or appearing to favor
                    shutting down the latitude that they have begun to win here.” So, I took that as
                    a general policy with respect to that problem. We, as far as I know didn't put
                    out any cautionary advice at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am thinking of the dynamics of an embassy. You usually
                        have junior officers who when things start to move almost get ahead of the
                        game, get excited and want to get involved. Were you sort of having to rein
                        them in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No, not really. At that period the atmosphere was such that Embassy
                    officers, although they may very well have still been surveyed from time to
                    time, had a lot of access. They could go to public events and meet people at
                    public events and could develop personal contacts with them and that has always
                    been my perception of what embassy officers ought to do if the circumstances
                    permit. In fact, just for doing that in 1958 in Moscow, I was expelled from the
                    country because the Soviets didn't share our view of what a diplomat normally
                    does. So you have to consider that I am on the more aggressive edge of this
                    issue. I wasn't restraining them.</p>
                <p>In some of the reporting, some of the enthusiasm of drawing dramatic conclusions
                    and so on from this or that would sometimes show itself and I very occasionally
                    would have to edit that down, but the material that came to me having passed
                    through Mark Garrison and his very competent editing very rarely in my view
                    required very much tinkering. I thought that he managed the officers in that
                    section very skillfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact at that time in Prague with the
                        Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Very little contact. In fact, I don't remember any at all in the
                    pre-invasion period except for the fact that you would see them at National Day
                    events. My own feeling was that it would not be terribly well viewed by the
                    Czechoslovaks to see us embracing the Soviets in a cheerful fashion at the time
                    that the Soviets were exerting a considerable amount of pressure on them. So I
                    never sought the Soviet representatives out at these events. If, by any chance,
                    I happened to run into one or one introduced himself to me, I would just chat
                    briefly and then move on. So, no, there was no particular contact. And I don't
                    recall much contact with other Socialist state diplomats. Maybe a little bit
                    with the Poles and I had very frequent and regular and friendly contact with a
                    Yugoslav journalist there from their state agency Tanjug, who had been in Prague
                    a number of years and was extraordinarily well informed. I guess he was the only
                    person at that time from the Eastern European collection of people that I recall
                    seeing regularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we look upon the situation? Were we looking at the
                        possibility of a scenario of what actually did happen, that the Soviets
                        would gather together and just snuff this out, and if it happened, were we
                        concerned about what our reaction would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BAKER: We were certainly looking at that possibility very acutely because all
                    this time Soviet forces were exercising close to the borders of Czechoslovakia
                    in Poland and East Germany particularly, and also in the western Ukraine. I
                    don't remember as much about them in Hungary. I think the Hungarians were trying
                    to as much as they could to stand down from this conflict. But certainly there
                    were plenty of Russian troops in position to do what they did. And we certainly
                    knew they were there. Of course they could have been there simply representing a
                    threat or they could have been there to carry out an actual invasion. I think my
                    own conclusion was, when we went back over these events, that the Soviets
                    themselves didn't decide which purpose they were there for until about four or
                    five days before the actual invasion. They hoped to bring enough pressure to
                    bear on Dubcek and the Czechoslovak leaders with a threat so that they would
                    achieve a rollback of the revisionist course or sufficient limitations of it so
                    that they could live with it and that they only decided to invade when they
                    reached the conclusion that they weren't going to be able to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it pretty much the feeling at the Embassy, although
                        obviously a decision like that would be made at the American President's
                        level, that no matter what happened we would only be passive
                        bystanders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I think that was pretty well understood and in fact it looked as if the US
                    government was leaning over backwards to illustrate that it was not trying to
                    exploit in any way the Czechoslovak reform movement. For example, an exercise
                    that we normally ran in Bavaria at that time of year, a major exercise, we
                    canceled because we didn't want to give any people an excuse to say that we were
                    gearing up to do some kind of a military response to whatever the Soviets might
                    do.</p>
                <p>And we didn't want anyone to think that we were actively encouraging the
                    Czechoslovaks to break out of the Warsaw Pact, or what ever, because we thought
                    if it looked like there was some American involvement over there that would
                    further stimulate the forces for intervention on the Russian side. The Russians
                    would say, “Hey, we had better move in and shut this off before it gets to the
                    point where we can't regain it.” Generally, I think, because of that posture
                    there was an assumption that we were not trying to pry Czechoslovakia away but
                    we were simply taking a benign posture towards their own internal process. And
                    the signals that we got from the Czechoslovak leaders was that that was
                    basically the kind of position they wanted us to take. They were not trying to
                    draw closer to us or give the appearance that they were drawing closer to
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the events of late August, 1968 play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BAKER: I had my own little personal saga in that regard. In early August of 1968,
                    right after that lunch that I described to you, I hastened back to the United
                    States on compassionate leave because my father had died. He had been quite ill
                    at the time I left and it was not totally a surprise, but I did want to go back
                    for the funeral. And I did and stayed a day or two more after which I thought I
                    should then turn right around and come back because of the fact that it seemed
                    to me that there was a good possibility that the situation would deteriorate. I
                    didn't go down to Washington. I talked with the people there on the phone and
                    said I was back but would be going back to Prague because I thought there could
                    be an intervention.</p>
                <p>The people in the Department said that I was a good soldier but they really
                    didn't think that was going to happen. The Warsaw Pact meeting in Bratislava had
                    more or less cooled that off. All our intelligence seemed to suggest that the
                    worst of the crisis was over.</p>
                <p>So I went back and a few days later around the 12th or 14th of August there were
                    a couple of quite dramatic visits to Prague. One by Tito, and one by Ceausescu,
                    the Romanian leader. And then there was the somewhat aborted visit by Ulbricht
                    who wanted to balance those two more independent Communist leaders by bringing a
                    more orthodox viewpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the leader and very strict Stalinist from East
                        Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: And he was one of the ones most alarmed by the course of events in
                    Czechoslovakia. The Czechs said, “Okay, you can come but you can only come to
                    Karlovy Vary and we will have a little party with you there.” They didn't want
                    him getting the kind of hostile treatment he might have gotten from the public
                    in Prague.</p>
                <p>Well, those events were further signals, I guess, to the conservatives in Russia
                    that the Czechs were not going the way they hoped after the Bratislava meeting
                    and Ulbricht probably sent in a rather alarmed report on his relative brush off
                    when he went to Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>At the same time, people in the diplomatic corps, because it was the middle of
                    August, were going off on holiday. Our military attach� came in on the Saturday
                    morning about the 16th or 17th of August and said that he was going on a
                    holiday. We were sitting up in the communications area, where we often do on a
                    Saturday morning to see what the cable traffic was. The Ambassador was there. He
                    turned to me and said, “The Colonel here is going to go on holiday.” I said,
                    “Well, what about it?” “Well, what do you think? Do you think there is going to
                    be any trouble?” I said, “Well, I don't know if there is going to be any
                    trouble, but my own judgment is that if there is going to be trouble it will
                    happen within the next ten or twelve days because the Czechoslovak Communist
                    Party has scheduled a congress for the end of August. At the congress they will
                    get rid of most of the people who are friends of the Russian leadership. So if
                    the Russians aren't satisfied with the current leadership and don't think they
                    are going to be responsive enough, this may be the time they move. Of course, it
                    is also the time in terms of weather and the position of their forces.”</p>
                <p>The Ambassador didn't disagree with that, but when I resurfaced again a few hours
                    later I said, “Well, what did you decide?” He said, “Well, the Colonel said his
                    colleagues were going so I said okay, go ahead.” So that was the way that came
                    out.</p>
                <p>About three or four days later I was awakened by the sound of heavy aircraft
                    coming in over the city. Not long after that a bang on my door by the
                    Ambassador—we lived up in the Embassy Residence compound—who said, “I'm on my
                    way down to the Embassy, do you want to come down with me? The Soviets are
                    here.” That is what happened. He, I think, received a couple of days before the
                    invasion a pretty strong indication from a source of his in Prague, another
                    ambassador, that the Soviets were going to move. He sent this in back channel to
                    alert the Department. He thought that this was a valid report. I never saw the
                    message so I don't know exactly what he put in it. It wasn't as if he was
                    totally surprised by what happened. But Washington certainly acted as if they
                    were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do at the Embassy during this period when the

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BAKER: The first two or three days we had a substantial evacuation problem of the
                    Americans who were in the city. There was a huge geological convention at which
                    about 400 Americans were present and other assorted individuals like Shirley
                    Temple Black, who I think was there for the multiple sclerosis drive, and a
                    number of journalists. All of these people were concerned for their safety. Of
                    course the journalists were concerned for how they would communicate the story
                    because their normal means of communication were blocked. So the Embassy was
                    filled with people and phone calls and we had a sort of crisis center set up to
                    handle all this. We told everybody to sit tight in their hotels and we would try
                    to arrange orderly evacuation procedures.At the same time, in order to get a
                    sense of what was happening in the city, we went out on two man patrols all day
                    for two or three days until the Soviet forces were stabilizing the situation. I
                    remember going down town with another officer the first day that the Soviets
                    were in there and there was a little small arms fire here and there and a rather
                    noisy encounter up near the television station in downtown Prague where the
                    Soviets had taken a couple of tanks up the street and were being harassed by
                    Czechs who had set fire to the gasoline drums on the back of the tanks. So there
                    were some explosions. I don't know if they fired their cannons into the
                    buildings...there were reports that some of them had.</p>
                <p>So we would see these Soviet tank crewmen on top of their tanks rattling down the
                    streets more or less trying to intimate a crowd that didn't appear to be very
                    intimated. The Czechs basically were distressed with what had happened and were
                    determined not to be cowed and I think pretty much convinced that the Russians
                    were not trying to do their job in a cruel fashion. They were trying to take
                    over with a minimum application of force and a maximum show of force.So there
                    were occasional casualties in Prague on those first few days, but there wasn't
                    any bloody massacre. There were a lot of people out in the streets, a lot of
                    young people charging around in backs of trucks waving Czechoslovak flags, a few
                    of which had been dipped in blood from the few victims that had been hit. So it
                    was not what I would describe as a war encounter, it was simply a rapid
                    occupation by an overwhelming display of force, including a lot of armored
                    vehicles and tanks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Embassy have any contact with any of these
                        occupying forces or did we stay away from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The main contact was through vehicle inspections. The Czechoslovak
                    opponents of the invasion were unwilling to cease and desist altogether, even
                    when the radio station and television station were taken over by the occupation
                    forces, Czech radio people seized enough radio equipment so that they could
                    broadcast from mobile places around the country. So they continued to broadcast
                    news of what was happening continually moving their transmitters around the
                    country to stay on the air. The Russians were trying to locate and shut down
                    these broadcasts. So they were looking for cars that were carrying radio
                    engineering equipment. The best place to intercept cars going from one part of
                    the country to another was on the bridges across the Vltava River that flows
                    through Prague.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>So some of our personnel who for one reason or another had to drive across these
                    bridges had their cars stopped and inspected and asked to open the trunks, etc.
                    When they protested that they were diplomatic and pointed out the diplomatic
                    plates, they were rebuffed apparently because the soldiers, not knowing the
                    Latin alphabet, couldn't distinguish a diplomatic plate from a normal plate. So
                    they were stopped just like everybody else.</p>
                <p>So we racked up a string of incidents where our diplomatic immunity had been
                    violated and a few days after the invasion the ambassador asked me to go to the
                    Soviet Embassy and lodge a protest about the violations of our diplomatic
                    rights. I did so and presented myself to my opposite number and he received me
                    with a good deal of courtesy offering me coffee or a drink. I declined all that
                    and said what my business was and made as forceful a complaint as I could and
                    then left.</p>
                <p>That was I thought the end of it. But the next morning, when I got into my office
                    and looked out the window, there was a Soviet truck, like an American 2 � ton
                    truck with a 50 caliber machine gun on top of it pointing right at my office
                    window. I didn't feel very comfortable with that so I went outside and found the
                    guy who was with the truck and asked to speak with the officer in command. This
                    captain showed up and I said, “Can you explain to me what your vehicle is doing
                    here?” He said, “I have been told that there have been inadvertent violations of
                    the diplomatic rights of the American Embassy and I have been told to be
                    positioned here to be sure that no further violations take place.” I said,
                    “Well, that is very considerate of you, but for heavens sake why do you have
                    your 50 caliber machine gun pointed at an Embassy window?” He had no explanation
                    for that. I said, “I would strongly request that either you withdraw your truck
                    to the end of the street or at least reposition your machine gun.” Some hours
                    later the truck was gone. It looked like it was a tail twisting exercise by my
                    opposite number.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the new Czech government, who were the hard liners
                        who took over, how were relations with them...from 1968 until you left in
                        1970? Did things just go down hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Our relations were very constrained and limited. The totally hard line
                    group actually didn't take over until the following April, after a rather
                    devastating riot which took place in Prague and other cities in the wake of the
                    Czech hockey team's victory over the Soviet's in the Stockholm final of the cup.
                    The indignities that were wreaked on Aeroflot and various Soviet installations
                    in that riot brought a rapid visit from the Soviet Chief of Staff and, not long
                    after that, a change in the Czechoslovak government.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>So over that winter what was happening was a gradual slicing off, salami style,
                    of the original Dubcek group. Dubcek was not removed, he was shifted to be
                    president of parliament, where he couldn't do a whole lot of harm. The prime
                    minister remained for some months, but the interior minister was changed and
                    some people were forced out all together. It looked as if the Russians, having
                    realized that they had made a military success but a political disaster, were
                    trying to mitigate the consequences by a fairly gradual turning down of the
                    screw. The man they sent to do that and was doing that reasonably cleverly, was
                    a diplomat named Kuznetzov, who had been a deputy foreign minister and an
                    experienced member of the Central Committee of the Party.</p>
                <p>But there was no question about who was in charge in this process. The
                    post-invasion government was not going to challenge the Russians in a serious
                    way, although they tried to resist some of the new arrangements that were
                    foisted on them.</p>
                <p>But the things that we would have wanted to do with the Czechoslovak government,
                    like proceed with a consular convention and set up cultural offices or settle
                    the claims agreement, were put aside because we knew this was not a government
                    that we could do that with. So there really wasn't much business to be done with
                    that government. We had occasional calls on the Foreign Ministry and problems
                    about citizens who ran into trouble, but it became a very low level type of
                    relationship. So much so that when the Nixon Administration was elected and
                    chose to send Jake Beam to Moscow as Ambassador, they did not feel any sense of
                    urgency about replacing him there. It was about six months before his successor,
                    Mac Toon, arrived in July, 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about living there? Was it a problem? Did you feel
                        that all of the security apparatus had descended on you again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, the atmosphere changed steadily, not immediately. Of course, after
                    the first two or three weeks of the invasion, one was impressed by the military
                    presence in the city. For example, I drove from my house, which was in a
                    residential area, down the winding Serpentine to what was called Mala Strana,
                    down near the river where our Embassy was. I would be doing a slalom each
                    morning between about a dozen Soviet tanks that were placed along the
                    Serpentine. So that gave you a certain sense of where you were at. Two or three
                    weeks after the invasion the Russians withdrew their personnel outside the city
                    so there wasn't a whole lot of evidence of Russian presence as the situation
                    stabilized and as the Russians were satisfied that the Czech government and
                    police were going to do their bidding.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Gradually, the people I knew and had begun to have normal friendly relationships
                    with began to indicate to me that they were under pressure to terminate the
                    relationship. Nobody was harassing me personally. Although I think the
                    surveillance did pick up, it wasn't terribly ostentatious. The main signal I got
                    was what I heard from my Czech contacts who said, “They know that I have been
                    seeing you and say that I would be better off if I didn't.” That sort of thing.
                    A few of them who were not in positions where they could be damaged, people who
                    were artists or musicians or something like that, seemed to be able to maintain
                    their contact with me. Most of them who had any kind of position in research
                    institutes or government bodies or organizations, sort of disappeared. So, one
                    didn't feel oppressed by measures that were taken against me or my family or the
                    Embassy personally, but by the general atmosphere of suspicion and withdrawal
                    that prevailed and really locked in after April, 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Czechoslovakia after this as far as its
                        role as an espionage center which seemed to be one of the more efficient of
                        the creatures of the Soviet Union? Was there training of terrorists that was
                        going on that we were aware of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I don't think we were really aware of that, at least I wasn't. There may
                    have been other people in the Embassy who were. But it was not a matter that
                    came across my desk. The Soviets resumed using Czech diplomats as intelligence
                    agents as they probably did, and in some cases may never have stopped. Most of
                    that was aimed at targets outside of Czechoslovakia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it didn't really get you involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No. What struck us in the period after the invasion was that President
                    Johnson, who was ending his presidency, was anxious to reach an arms control
                    agreement with the Soviets and initially did not appear as if he even wanted to
                    pause in his pursuit of an understanding with the Russians despite this rather
                    brutal act in the middle of Europe. I think that distressed some of us.
                    Eventually he was prevailed upon to stand down from that. But generally
                    speaking, I think I felt at that time and some time afterwards, that for various
                    reasons, and I guess Vietnam was one of them, we were too ready too soon to let
                    it go and not allow it to be an obstruction to the US-Soviet relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Soviets moved into Afghanistan we took a much
                        firmer stance. It was different, of course, but perhaps we had made the
                        Soviets feel they would get the same reaction from us as in
                        Czechoslovakia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BAKER: I think there probably were Soviets who were surprised at our reaction in
                    Afghanistan. Of course, Afghanistan was not really part of the Socialist bloc
                    and therefore moving into Afghanistan represented a new advance into a
                    previously unassimilated, unoccupied area and one which could give them closer
                    access to the Indian Ocean. So there were several reasons for that sharper
                    reaction. And, of course, by that time we were out of the Vietnam thing and
                    there weren't any more wishful hopes that the Russians somehow could help us
                    extract honorably from that situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Prague in 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, in August, 1970. I was expecting to stay there another year but there
                    were changes back in the European Bureau and I was apparently somebody's idea of
                    somebody who could come back and run Eastern European stuff out of the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there essentially for four years weren't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: In the European Bureau, yes. And three years in the IO Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your main concerns in the European Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: By that time my main concerns were helping to define and then carrying out
                    the strategy which the NSC wanted to enunciate for our relationship with Eastern
                    Europe as a region. They tasked the Department with coming up with a strategy
                    paper, which I was more or less in charge of.</p>
                <p>The general thrust of that paper was to encourage diversity in the Eastern
                    European part of the Soviet Bloc. Diversity in either internal policy, such as
                    the kind of economic reforms that were going on in Hungary or being rather
                    tentatively tried in Poland, or with regard to foreign policy, which was
                    apparent in Romania with the Ceausescu challenge to the Warsaw Pact
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>So we were then devising a series of carrots that would encourage these moves
                    towards diversity and illustrate the kinds of advantages that might accrue to
                    countries that were able gradually to express some more individuality in that
                    situation and eventually qualifying for Most Favored Nation treatment as the
                    Romanians and as the Hungarians, some time after my tenure, did, and as the
                    Poles always had since 1956 or shortly after.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>So there was a fair amount of activity as detente flowered in the early
                    seventies. The US-Soviet detente, as it was called at that time, made it a
                    little more possible for us to have these closer relationships with some Eastern
                    European governments. In addition to Yugoslavia, of course, which was a case of
                    its own, I spent a lot of time on Poland and Hungary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned doing a paper that the NSC wanted. The
                        charge has been levied that Henry Kissinger, who was head of the NSC at the
                        time, asked the State Department to do a whole series of papers on various
                        things in order to keep the State Department so tied up that he could go
                        ahead along with President Nixon and pursue foreign policy without having
                        the Foreign Service and Co. bother them. Did you get any feel for that kind
                        of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: That might have been true in some cases, but it didn't correspond to my
                    experience. One reason for that is that Eastern Europe for Kissinger and
                    President Nixon were not a top of the line problem. If they wanted to tie up the
                    State Department in order to conduct high diplomacy that might be on Vietnam or
                    the Soviet Union or China or something like that. Kissinger and Nixon were not
                    overflowing with energy that they wanted to expend in Eastern Europe, so I took
                    Kissinger's request to elaborate a paper like this at face value and it seemed
                    to me a logical thing to do. I thought Kissinger was correct to want to have a
                    strategy to work from, to be a frame work for the day-to-day things that the
                    State Department does, rather than just to do them and have the policy flow from
                    doing them. I didn't feel that I was being hoodwinked and I did my best on this
                    paper and it wound its way through the bureaucracy and survived the scrutiny of
                    Kissinger and his people more or less intact. So I had some satisfaction in
                    creating the strategy and then operating within it. And within it, Poland and
                    Hungary and in another sense Romania, offered the greatest opportunities for
                    carrying it out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that period, how did you view Ceausescu and Romania at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, we didn't think that that was a very benign regime, but we were
                    intrigued by the degree to which Ceausescu was willing to diverge from Soviet
                    policy on a number of issues. Not only the United Nations but with respect with
                    the Middle East, with relations with Israel, with European security discussions,
                    some arms control issues, etc. It seemed to us that that diversity was worth
                    encouraging.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>On top of that, Nixon, for some reason or other, had struck a particular
                    admiration society with Ceausescu, I think on an earlier visit he had made to
                    Eastern Europe before he was elected. So Ceausescu played off of that. One of my
                    tasks was to organize the reception of Ceausescu's 1973 state visit. That proved
                    to be somewhat more than I bargained for because his advance people and his
                    party wanted a whole lot of perks and things that we normally didn't provide.
                    And particularly they wanted a very fancy joint statement or communique. The
                    State Department didn't think much of that because they said if we do one of
                    these for Ceausescu we will have to do one for every other guy who comes down
                    the road. So let's try to avoid it.</p>
                <p>But eventually the word came from the White House, “Yeah, if he wants it let's do
                    it. Don't give away the store or anything, but let's go through the motions.” So
                    I had to help sort of hammer out this statement of joint views with Ceausescu's
                    people which was eventually propagated and immediately forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Czechs, as far as relations were concerned, by
                        this time sort of sunk back into a deep freeze?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. During that whole period, 1970-74, when Czechoslovakia was one of the
                    countries I had to deal with, I didn't spend much time on Czechoslovakia. There
                    were no visits there until Secretary Rogers, for some reason, decided that that
                    was a blank spot on his map and wanted to go. Somewhat over our objections he
                    made a one-day stop there. We didn't think the relationship deserved that
                    attention. So I didn't spend much time on Czechoslovakia during that period or
                    on Bulgaria, which was a rather orthodox Communist government. I had good
                    country officers there and the kinds of issues and problems we had were quite
                    within their capabilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Hungary? Did that seem like a brighter promising
                        spot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. Probably in a way, the most promising spot because they were moving
                    ahead on the economic reform which they had started in 1967. They were
                    interested in better economic relationships, willing to conclude a claims
                    agreement which we did, and willing to conclude a consular agreement which we
                    did, and a cultural agreement. So they, along with the Poles, were the best
                    example of what we could do within the strategy that I described. I had quite a
                    few visits that I had to support there. I accompanied our Commerce Secretary
                    there at one point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, why don't we finish up Eastern Europe and next time
                        I will catch you on the International Organizations, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>BAKER: The Hungarians were very cordial when we went there. They were
                    particularly forthcoming in receiving our senior people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any significant problems in Eastern Europe at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: The most acute one that did result in a few National Security Council
                    meetings, or at least Assistant Secretary level meetings, was the events at
                    Gdansk in December, 1970. This was when Lech Walesa first emerged from the
                    shipyards at Gdansk. There was violence there when the Polish government, still
                    Gomulka's government at the time, used force there. There were people killed. It
                    was a nasty show, but it was also a show of considerable discontent and seeds of
                    what later became Solidarity.</p>
                <p>I think that event had reverberations throughout the Eastern Bloc and into the
                    Soviet Union. So it was something that deserved attention at a high level. I
                    remember sitting in on a couple of Senior Interagency Group meetings with Henry
                    Kissinger and with Assistant Secretary for Europe Hillenbrand.</p>
                <p>That was the main drama of that period. Otherwise there wasn't a lot of drama,
                    just a lot of normal bilateral business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about this, did we see this as anything, the
                        Gdansk thing or was it sort of like the Berlin uprising, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, it led to the end of Gomulka's reign there and produced a new Party
                    leadership with Gierek. Under Gierek there was a more pragmatic approach both
                    internally and internationally. Gierek launched on quite a program of getting
                    loans and credits to develop Polish industry. So that involved our people in a
                    closer relationship than had existed before the Gdansk events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way we saw this as the beginning of a change, did
                        we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, But in Poland it wasn't the first sign of it. Go back to 1956 and the
                    events there during the Khrushchev period. You had Gomulka shutting that down
                    for ten years and then finally driving people to some desperation which was
                    reflected in Gdansk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Why don't we stop here and we'll pick up when you
                        went off to the UN and got into IO next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>We just got you out of DAS for Eastern Europe and we are going to the UNP,
                    1974-75. What particular phase of the UN were you working on?</p>
                <p>BAKER: That was a period, as I recall, when we were getting a lot of grief in the
                    UN from the developing world and from what was then the non-aligned group who
                    formed a block at the UN that was able to vote a lot of things through the
                    General Assembly. Some of the things that they voted through were not terribly
                    congenial to US purposes. The result of that was that the Mission in New York
                    frequently needed to have us instruct the field, particularly governments in
                    non-aligned countries that had some influence on the group, and where we had
                    some influence, regarding the importance of some of the issues that came up.</p>
                <p>For example, the Cubans and others were trying to get Puerto Rico dealt with as a
                    colonial issue in the Committee of 24, which is where the colonial issues were
                    taken up in the UN. I think it was also in the Fall of 1974 that the effort was
                    made to give the PLO observer status at the General Assembly and for Arafat to
                    come and speak at the General Assembly, which he did packing a pistol.</p>
                <p>Those were sort of days of some defiance on the part of the non-aligned world of
                    what they saw as an overly ambitious and, in the view of the left wing of the
                    movement, even “imperialist,” United States foreign policy. And, of course, at
                    the same time it was apparent that the effort in Vietnam was winding down not
                    very successfully and that the American public was losing support for it
                    rapidly. Then the revelations about Watergate were coming out about that time.
                    So this was not a period when the US was able to stand as tall as it might wish
                    in the halls of the United Nations.We were busy trying to head off these various
                    resolutions and efforts in the UN. We had to pick and chose a little bit because
                    a resolution in the General Assembly is really a statement of opinion and it
                    doesn't have a lot of legal force most of the time. There is an occasional
                    resolution that does have a semblance of legal force. Perhaps the most important
                    thing that the General Assembly can do is to confer status and that is
                    politically significant.</p>
                <p>For example, if you are the PLO or a Southwest African revolutionary movement,
                    and you want to get observer status at the UN and the Assembly gives it to you,
                    you gain status that has political significance. The same is true of what was
                    then the annual argument over North Korea...in the resolution on behalf of North
                    Korea which, had it prevailed, would have given them status. So it was a
                    struggle in a way over political status and a struggle in which we perceived the
                    non-aligned movement and the developing world being often led by a small group
                    of radical states and not a group that was necessarily interested in developing
                    an effective dialogue with the developed countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which were the preeminent radical states from our
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BAKER: One of the principal organizers of the non-aligned movement at that period
                    was Algeria. They had a fairly radical, at least in terms of international
                    policy, regime at that time and were quite effective. Iraq was in there. The
                    original founders of the non-aligned movement, Yugoslavia and India, were more
                    on the moderate side, although on certain issues they were up there with the
                    radicals too. They were certainly no help to us on Puerto Rico, Palestine and
                    things like that. Of course, Cuba was one of the activist, radical states of the
                    non-aligned movement and despite their, what we thought was quite apparent,
                    alignment with the Soviet Bloc, they were able to participate in the non-aligned
                    movement and host meetings.So it was our perception at that time that the
                    non-aligned movement in its definition of non-alignment and in its choice of
                    leadership, seemed to be stacked against us and closer to the foreign policy
                    objectives of the Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular position in this 1974-75
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I was Director of the Office of the UN Political Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: In Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then from 1975-77 you moved up a notch. Is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. In the middle of 1975 the then Assistant Secretary of State for
                    International Organizations, Bill Buffum, left the Service and became Under
                    Secretary General of the UN. Kissinger, who was then Secretary of State,
                    replaced him with Sam Lewis, who had been Deputy Director for Policy Planning
                    under Winston Lord. I think Sam had distinguished himself in that job and had
                    gotten the Secretary's attention and confidence, so he made Sam Assistant
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>When Sam started looking at how he would organize the Bureau, I said, “Well, I
                    have stayed on a little longer in Washington to do this UNP job and if I am
                    going to stay on still longer, I would want to be a little closer to your
                    management team here.” Sam seemed to respond to that and asked me to be one of
                    his deputies in the Bureau and particularly for the political issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the waning days of the Nixon
                        Administration, before Ford came. How about Henry Kissinger? What was your
                        impression of Henry Kissinger and the United Nations? How did he view it and
                        use it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>BAKER: I think Henry Kissinger was quite aware of the United Nations as a
                    political instrument that could be used for political purposes. And also aware
                    that in that period it seemed to be used more against our purposes than in
                    support of them. Nevertheless, he was quite sensitive to the way we would
                    approach other governments about issues in the UN. Frequently he would want
                    personally to look at the kind of instructions that we did for approaching say,
                    the government of Algeria, or the government of Zaire, or the government of Sri
                    Lanka, or the government of Yugoslavia, whoever we thought we had some influence
                    with that might get us a better result in the non-aligned area. I think he felt
                    that there were often other issues that were important with those countries and
                    he wanted to be sure that these approaches were properly couched. At various
                    points he would hold them up for several days or longer until he could
                    personally review them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a blanket operation in the way it some times
                        is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: No. He took a very close interest in that. I don't know whether he was a
                    great fan of the United Nations, but he certainly recognized its psychological
                    and political importance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a deputy assistant secretary what was your particular
                        beat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: All political issues. Not only in the UN Security Council and General
                    Assembly but also political issues that would arise in the technical agencies,
                    like the World Health Organization or UNESCO. So I got drawn into the issue of
                    whether or not we left UNESCO and the issue of trying to get status for the PLO
                    or trying to denigrate Israel in the technical agencies as well.</p>
                <p>One of the principal things that happened while I was in that role was that Pat
                    Moynihan, who Kissinger and Ford had selected to follow John Scali at the UN. It
                    was at the Assembly in 1975 when the “Zionism-equals-Racism” resolution was
                    passed. Moynihan was infuriated by that resolution. I think he felt that it was
                    much too a broad brush characterization of the Zionist movement to call it
                    racist. Of course, he was a long time citizen of New York with what some people
                    thought political ambitions there...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might mention that he is presently a Senator from New
                        York.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>BAKER: The fact that he took umbrage at that particular resolution was not
                    surprising and already viewed as being not only proper indignation for the UN
                    representative but something with perhaps a longer view ahead. At the end of
                    that Assembly he fired off a fairly vigorous telegram to Kissinger about what we
                    ought to do about being browbeaten at the UN by the developing countries and
                    called for using more American leverage bilaterally vis-a-vis these countries
                    that were giving us excessive grief in the United Nations.</p>
                <p>So Kissinger responded to that by asking the IO Bureau to come up with a method
                    of doing that and Sam asked me to develop that. We then did develop a method for
                    doing that and that was one of the principal features of that job I had there,
                    developing and operating that system.</p>
                <p>What we did was to identify a small number of issues in the General Assembly that
                    we thought were important enough to make a case over to some of the non-aligned
                    governments. We carefully developed how to present that case. Then we started a
                    campaign of briefing our embassies in the non-aligned world as to why those
                    issues were important and how one might present them. And on top of that we
                    undertook a program to conduct a personal briefing of every ambassador when he
                    came in on consultation in IO about these issues, because it was our feeling
                    that traditionally ambassadors and missions who were performing functions
                    primarily in a bilateral context tended to discount somewhat the instructions
                    that they got about these multilateral relationships. If they hadn't served in
                    multilateral organizations and didn't see the significance of some of these
                    things we felt they probably were sort of going through the motions when they
                    were instructed to carry out these things. And the governments that they were
                    speaking to probably sensed that they were going through the motions and didn't
                    take it terribly seriously. So we wanted to upgrade the quality of the
                    presentations, upgrade the level at which they were made and add the significant
                    element by actually stating that these issues were important enough to
                    negatively affect certain aspects of our bilateral relations.</p>
                <p>Of course, the press immediately began to say that we were threatening small
                    countries with our foreign assistance program or with our food aid and things
                    like that. That we were trying to starve people into submission, etc.</p>
                <p>We were careful not to really make those kinds of threats. The implication was
                    that we might reach that point if our concerns were not given some attention,
                    but we never instructed ambassadors to say, “If you don't do this than we will
                    cut this AID program or lower their priority on this commodity loan, etc.” But
                    the implication was that we could do that and we would look at it. And that was
                    enough to get a lot of people in the development community worked up about this
                    effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>However, we persisted with that for those couple of years. At the Assembly of
                    1976 and the Assembly that we were preparing of 1977, we did reasonably well in
                    protecting ourselves and defending ourselves in the General Assembly on those
                    selected key issues because we did manage to persuade friendly nations in the
                    non-aligned area that they were important enough to us to be worth their
                    attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did President Ford play any role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I didn't get the sense that President Ford was particularly involved
                    personally in this exercise. Kissinger certainly was and he was supportive of
                    it. I think Kissinger liked to use power and leverage to defend and accomplish
                    US purposes. And he wanted to use it with a certain amount of sophistication,
                    and that's what we tried to do, to use American power and influence in defense
                    of our interests at the United Nations...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a little about Sam Lewis. He is head of Policy
                        Planning right now, he has come back. How did he operate when he was in
                        charge of International Organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I thought Sam was a good leader. He listened very carefully to his
                    principal office directors and deputies. He knew which issues were the ones that
                    he, himself, had to focus on and decide, and he knew which ones he could
                    delegate to his management group. So I was quite comfortable working with Sam.
                    We kept in close touch on things that might be sensitive or get the Secretary
                    excited. But generally I had the necessary latitude to do what I needed to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations between Lewis and Moynihan, when
                        Moynihan was there, or did they overlap?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, they did overlap and I think they had reasonably good relations, but
                    Moynihan felt that he was a member of the Cabinet and that he needed to say his
                    piece to the Secretary and the President, so I don't think he took a lot of
                    guidance from Sam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You moved from that to going out to Rome from 1977-79
                        doing what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Well, I went out to Rome as the US representative to the food aid
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BAKER: Yes, the FAO; the World Food Program; the International Fund for
                    Agricultural Development, which was a new bank that was set up this time
                    designed to draw in all that Middle Eastern oil money that had come out of the
                    huge fortunes oil producing countries made out of the energy crisis in 1973; and
                    then the World Food Council which was created because of the concern that
                    population was growing and hunger was growing in the world.</p>
                <p>All that came about because of the change in administration. In 1977, the Carter
                    Administration came in and appointed a new Assistant Secretary for IO. He
                    wanted, obviously, new deputies who would be with him for a four year period so
                    those of us who were there were up for the usual scramble to try to get
                    embassies and equivalent posts abroad because we knew we would not be kept on,
                    didn't expect to be kept on because when administrations change they always
                    assume that if you worked for the previous administration at that level that you
                    were somehow on the other team.</p>
                <p>I guess I was somewhat marked by certain parts of Washington public opinion
                    because I had been the organizer of the campaign to improve our results in the
                    General Assembly and some people in the Carter camp thought that was hardball
                    and the whole Carter foreign policy was much more North/South oriented at the
                    outset. Eventually, with Afghanistan and arms control, it went back to its
                    East/West axis. But it came in with a North/South flavor and human rights, etc.
                    So, I guess I was seen by some of those people as part of the bad old Kissinger
                    team. That didn't help me a whole lot in coming out of the change with a big
                    time assignment abroad. And I was also disadvantaged by the fact that the
                    Assistant Secretary asked me to stay on initially, although I knew it wouldn't
                    be for terribly long. But it was long enough that it kept me from competing for
                    some of the posts I might otherwise have had a run at.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I wound up working for the new Administration for about six or seven
                    months as deputy and then getting to be chief of the small mission in Rome to
                    the food aid agencies.But it was not an ambassadorial post, it was elevated to a
                    ministerial post and, of course, next time around because a Congresswoman was
                    interested in the job, it became an ambassadorial post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fenwick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. It was a pleasant place to be. I had served in Rome before, as you
                    know, and I like Rome, spoke Italian and the job had a lot of autonomy. I knew
                    the ambassador well, Dick Gardner. He was instrumental in my being nominated out
                    there. Although he was very interested in the United Nations, he soon discovered
                    that the Italian scene was going to take his full time, so he was pleased to
                    have me do everything that had to be done at those international
                    organizations—to represent the United States in their governing bodies, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the prime concerns when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BAKER: Curiously enough, although these agencies were primarily aimed at the
                    problems of the developing world, and although the Carter Administration had a
                    strong orientation towards North/South relations in the developing world, my
                    instructions had to do mostly with holding down budgetary growth and keeping the
                    organizations' costs from ballooning.The principal thing that tended to make
                    them balloon was that the Director General, who had been chosen by third world
                    majority and was a Lebanese, was busily cultivating his constituency by creating
                    a program of technical assistance grants, which was very much under his own
                    personal management. This program was laid on to the regular budget and tended
                    to cause it to grow. The slogan that I was instructed to work for was zero real
                    growth. It was my job to organize the principal contributor countries to the FAO
                    as a group to act in the governing bodies of the FAO to control cost. So that
                    made me about as popular as a skunk at a picnic. The Director General very soon
                    identified me as his principal nemesis in town and although I had polite
                    relations with him and always did the right thing from a protocol standpoint, it
                    was a fairly stiff relationship over those years.</p>
                <p>In the World Food Program, it was a little bit different because that program
                    does not have a regular budget with assessed contributions. It operates on the
                    basis of voluntary contributions from the members, and the United States, having
                    originally suggested that organization back in the days when McGovern was
                    finding ways to move our large agricultural surpluses in constructive ways, was
                    a major contributor of food, of wheat, powdered milk and flour. The whole idea
                    was to try to get those commodities to countries that needed them because they
                    were hungry but then to distribute them to hungry people who did work in work
                    projects of a development nature. So the food-for-work program was a significant
                    part of that organization's work.The program ran into the usual hazards of how
                    do you land and protect and handle food in tropical areas in developing
                    countries and keep track of it and cut down on waste, spoilage and pilfering,
                    etc. But it had dedicated people working for it. The US AID was the principal
                    agency back in Washington that was responsible for our input into that
                    agency.</p>
                <p>AID was also significant in IFAD, the International Fund for Agricultural
                    Development, which we helped get started out there in 1977.</p>
                <p>So it was that sort of work. I didn't feel that I was at the cutting edge of
                    American foreign policy exactly...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were helping to get food to people which may have
                        been of more benefit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: It was interesting. One of the things that I pointed out to the Department
                    was that I would be more effective in the governing bodies if I had actually
                    been to the field and seen the projects and observed them myself and could speak
                    about their benefits or weaknesses. So I made various trips to Tunisia, Sudan,
                    Egypt, Malaysia, Nepal, Bangladesh, to look at projects.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back in 1979 and went to Refugee
                        Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. While I was in that job, and I thought I would probably be there for
                    three years, the Carter Administration, largely as the result of the huge
                    outflow of boat refugees from Vietnam, decided to create a new structure for
                    management of refugee flows and intake into the United States. They created a
                    bureau in the State Department and also a government-wide coordinator who would
                    coordinate not only State but HEW and other agencies concerned with the refugee
                    problem.</p>
                <p>Carter named Dick Clark, who had been defeated as a Senator from Iowa in 1978, as
                    coordinator. I think there was probably a double strategy there. One was that
                    Carter knew that in the 1980 election the struggle would start, as usual, in
                    Iowa. Clark could be an asset for anyone who wanted to run for the Democratic
                    nomination and I think Carter was concerned that he might have some opposition
                    so he named Clark to that position, I guess to be sure that he either was
                    neutralized or, if he did do anything politically it would be in support of the
                    President.</p>
                <p>Clark was more or less authorized to try to build this new structure and recruit
                    a director of the bureau, which is an assistant secretary level position. For
                    some reason or other my name was given to him and he interviewed a number of
                    people. Eventually he offered me the job. Given the level of the job I thought I
                    ought to accept. I came back with some regrets from Rome, which I like, to take
                    this bear of a job with a staff that had been partially selected by Clark, and a
                    bunch of people of varying skills that other bureaus had been asked to
                    contribute.</p>
                <p>So then I began to address these problems primarily of Vietnam refugees who we
                    were receiving at the rate of 14,000 a month. We had to contract with religious
                    organizations to try to settle these people and find them jobs, etc. The flow
                    into Malaysia and Thailand was such that those countries were beginning to talk
                    about turning them back, pushing them out to sea. So we had to move quickly with
                    the help of the Philippine government to establish a camp in the Philippines
                    where we could take the overflow because there were more coming out than could
                    fit under our approved 14,000 a month level. If we didn't take them off the
                    hands of the Malaysians and the Thais, then they would push boats back out to
                    sea where they were victims of piracy, and what all.</p>
                <p>So I started to work at that and had only been at it for three or four months
                    when Clark told us that he was resigning to work for the nomination of Ted
                    Kennedy. That didn't go down very well with the White House. Meantime the crisis
                    on the Cambodian border was taking place because the Khmer Rouge had carried out
                    such a brutal policy in Cambodia that a lot of Cambodians had gone up into
                    Thailand. The Thais did not want to acknowledge them or accept them as refugees
                    so they set up this rather curious non-refugee refuge along the Thai-Cambodian
                    border which then the Administration asked us to deal with.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>I thought that this was the ideal type of problem for the disaster relief agency
                    that the AID people have, but no, it had to be done by the Refugee Bureau, a
                    struggling, understaffed organization. So our initial efforts to cope with that
                    with one or two guys trying to respond to this huge problem were not terribly
                    impressive. That fact, plus Clark's departure put me into a bad spot and the
                    White House decided that when Clark went, all the senior people he had appointed
                    should also go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So once again you were attacked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: A new squad came in and they asked me to stay on in a somewhat unclear
                    role so that there would be some continuity in what we were doing. I did this
                    for a few months, but it was pretty awkward.</p>
                <p>Then I was asked to fill in as deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research. I took that opportunity with some relief and
                    performed that function for most of the rest of 1980. That was an interesting
                    job. That was a job where you plan and edit the product which goes to the
                    Secretary and President. A range of intelligence products. I was the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Current Intelligence. I enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feeling for what Carter particularly

                <p>BAKER: One of the things that the Carter White House was obsessing over during
                    that period was, of course, the hostages in Iran because in that winter,
                    November 1979, they had been seized. When I came into that job in INR, I think
                    it was around March 1, 1980, it was on everybody's mind so that was what the
                    White House was heavily concerned with. The President was making statements
                    every day about the nature of our concern.</p>
                <p>In the meantime other things were being prepared. One of the things we were asked
                    to do in INR was to prepare our considered judgment as to what would be the
                    reaction in the world to an effort to rescue the hostages by force and we did
                    that. It was not a very edifying result, I guess, particularly considering the
                    fact that at the same time, unknown to us, plans were going ahead for the desert
                    rescue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was abortive. What was your judgment of what world
                        opinion would be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Pretty negative, mainly because of the concern that the cost would be
                    high.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about human life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. And as you know, the Secretary, himself...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cyrus Vance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: ...had serious reservations about that decision and it was ultimately the
                    decision that was made over his objections that eventually led to his
                    resignation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Carter Administration left in 1981, then you also
                        moved on didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. At the end of the Carter Administration, because the position I had
                    been in in INR was filling in for a guy who was on detail up at the Council on
                    Foreign Relations. When he came back, I left that position and was asked by
                    Donald McHenry, who had taken Andy Young's place at the UN, when Andy got a
                    little too cheerful with the PLO, to come up to the General Assembly and help
                    handle all the economic and social issues, including refugee issues as
                    minister-counselor in the Mission.</p>
                <p>He knew and I knew that this would be a one Assembly affair. I didn't want to
                    move to New York. So I went up there and spent that Assembly in New York coming
                    home on weekends. I was working such issues as the great North-South bargain
                    project that the developing countries were pressing with the developed
                    countries. That was a center piece of the stuff we were doing up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The idea being that the North was rich and the South was
                        poor basically in world terms. How could the North transfer basically it
                        wealth to the South.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: After the Reagan election, the North-South negotiation was sort of
                    dismissed out of hand by Reagan and Jeane Fitzpatrick and tended to sort of go
                    away. We just stopped dealing on that because Jean took a much harder line
                    vis-a-vis the third world.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>So that was what I was doing when the election took place. I had no special in
                    with the Reagan Administration and no great enthusiasm for the Reagan approach
                    to the world. One of the reasons was that, in the course of the previous five
                    years, I had been further schooled in the significance of multilateral diplomacy
                    and the Reagan approach to the world, particularly at the outset, was a
                    unilateral one with rather little space given to the views of our allies or of
                    multilateral organizations. I had a hard time seeing exactly what kind of
                    comfortable place I could find at a high level in that concept. So I was pleased
                    enough to be invited to go to the War College and join the faculty there and
                    that is what I did basically for the rest of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a couple of questions about the War College. What was
                        your impression at this particular period of time of how the military viewed
                        foreign affairs and State Department as you saw their reactions at the War
                        College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I became a great admirer of the War College and what happened at the War
                    College. I was on the faculty for three years and then another year in a
                    National Defense research project writing a book for them.</p>
                <p>While I was on the faculty, what impressed me was that you have a lot of very
                    able military officers coming in there beginning to read about answers and think
                    about foreign affairs issues and carrying with them a fair amount of freight
                    about State Department and civilian personnel in the conduct of our foreign
                    policy. Generally their orientation was that none of those people were really
                    vigorously enough defending American interests.</p>
                <p>A lot of these guys had been out in Vietnam and had put their lives at risk in a
                    cause which eventually the government and the public didn't support. That was a
                    bitter memory that a lot of them were carrying. Some of that bitterness, I
                    think, slopped over in their attitude towards the civilian hierarchy. So there
                    had to be each year with each new group the process of coming to understand and
                    appreciate the civilian students, as about a quarter of them were civilians with
                    around 20 or so from the State Department and other agencies as well. These
                    civilians, of course, were carefully distributed among the seminar groups so
                    that there was never any group that was strictly military.</p>
                <p>You began to see that people began to relate to each other in a less
                    stereotypical way. I think, also, it was instructive for the civilians. By that
                    time in our history we were getting a lot of civilians who had never served in
                    the military coming up in the Foreign Service and they had some of their own
                    stereotypes about the military. And there were always a couple of guys from the
                    military in the War College class who fully bore out the stereotype...sort of
                    the “nuke them” type. But those were exceptions and aberrations. I think most of
                    the civilians came to realize that these were very sensible, practical, and
                    dedicated people who were eager to move on to a higher level of
                    understanding.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>A certain coming-to-understand-each-other took place in this process which I felt
                    was extremely important for preparing the next generation of strategic
                    leadership for the country. So I continue to think it is a very valuable
                    institution. I think it is quite well run and that the services have good people
                    there, both on the faculty and the student body, although the Navy is a little
                    bit more inclined to send its best guys up to the Newport Naval War College, I
                    think, because they feel the military content of the War College program is not
                    as much Navy as they might like, but still the guys who come from Navy are good
                    people. But I would say in my experience there that the higher achievers and
                    performers on the military side tended to be Army or Air Force guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you retired in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. During the last year I was there I was writing a book, but I was also
                    looking around for second career opportunities and eventually came across this
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are here at the Atlantic Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: Yes. I left the Service at the end of February, 1986 and joined the
                    Council on the first of March. I have been here as a consultant ever since, most
                    of the time practically as a full time consultant. But at those times when I
                    have not been able to raise enough funds to make the Council comfortable, I have
                    been less than a full time consultant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So really you have to raise money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: I have to raise money to run the programs I run. If I don't raise enough
                    money to run the programs I run and cover my salary, I work less. So I have over
                    the past seven years occasionally done work for the government. I worked a
                    little bit in the asylum program, and a while in the intelligence community
                    staff. But for the most part I have worked here and now they have just asked me
                    to be a vice president here as a full time employee. So as of October 1, I have
                    worked on a more permanent status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. I really appreciate
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BAKER: You are welcome.</p>
