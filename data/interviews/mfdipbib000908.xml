                <p>Q: Today is the 24th of June, 1999. This is an interview with Dell Pendergrast.
                    This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                    Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Well, Dell, let's start at the
                    beginning. When, where were you born, and can you tell me something about your
                    family?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I was born November 23, 1941, in Chicago, Illinois, exactly two
                    weeks to the day before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. I don't necessarily make
                    any connection between those two events, but that did occur. And I grew up in
                    the Chicago area during my formative years. My background, growing up in the
                    &gt;40s and &gt;50s, was, in the context of the time and my origins, perhaps
                    somewhat improbable in terms of preparation for the Foreign Service. In that
                    period, of course, the Foreign Service had not diversified significantly and was
                    still heavily dominated by people from the Ivy League, from the East, from,
                    shall we say, the “internationalist class” that prevailed before the diversity
                    of gender, race, and region began to take hold later on. My background was very
                    distinctly Middle West, provincial, parochial, even perhaps, one might even say,
                    xenophobic. My parents, although both university-educated, were rural in their
                    roots. Their families were from Midwest farming communities, and they reflected,
                    I think, the best and the worst of the rural Midwest culture: self-reliant,
                    independent, sturdy, often deeply religious, but at the same time, distrustful
                    of the outside world, even the big cities of America, the East Coast, and
                    Washington as well - to say nothing of the world outside the United States. The
                    rural Midwest was isolationist, and that certainly was reflected in my parents'
                    attitudes and values that were passed on to me during the &gt;40s and
                    &gt;50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like Colonel McCormick's favorite ground
                        troops.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Absolutely. My parents were great fans of Colonel McCormick and the
                    Chicago Tribune, which of course delivered its unambiguously isolationist
                    message every day to my doorstep. And I did, obviously, in those early years
                    absorb many of these attitudes and values that my parents reflected, a rather
                    improbable preparation for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say your mother and father were both college
                        graduates.Where did they go to school, and then what were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, both my parents were graduates of Northwestern University, of
                    the Medill School of Journalism there, one of the premier professional
                    journalism programs in the country. The product of a small Central Illinois high
                    school, my father was an accomplished athlete in both baseball and basketball at
                    Northwestern in the Big Ten and captained the basketball team there. My mother
                    went on and had an early career in journalism in the Chicago area but later
                    became, as we call it now, a stay-at-home mom when the children came along. My
                    father, instead of journalism, went into the public relations field and was a
                    public relations executive with several companies in the Chicago area. Although
                    from essentially rural backgrounds, they did make that transition through their
                    university experience to a metropolitan lifestyle. But there was always, of
                    course, those roots in the values and attitudes of the rural Midwest, strongly
                    conservative and isolationist. They were not only great followers of Colonel
                    McCormick, but strong supporters of Robert Taft, the conservative Republican
                    candidate for president in the early '50s. When he was defeated for the
                    Republican nomination in 1952 by Dwight Eisenhower, it was a dreary, black day
                    in our household. It was again something I remember quite vividly. My parents
                    viewed Eisenhower with some suspicion despite his war-hero status. He was too
                    closely identified with the Eastern Establishment, the liberal Dewey wing of the
                    Republican party, which my parents lamented as little different than the New
                    Deal Democrats. As you can imagine, Franklin Roosevelt=s name was rarely uttered
                    in our house without appropriate condemnation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any other family, I mean, other brothers,
                        sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I had a younger brother and sister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of talk around the dinner table and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Always. My parents being both university educated and very engaged
                    in local community and often political affairs, there were very frequent
                    discussion of politics but with a distinctly right-wing edge to it, very
                    distrustful of Washington, of the Democratic party particularly, and I recall
                    now, of the State Department. The Department at that time was clearly
                    associated, in my parents' minds, with Alger Hiss and Dean Acheson, who somehow
                    took on a rather demonic character. Effete, Eastern Establishment types who sold
                    out the country, at least in the eyes of my parents. And you can imagine that
                    the idea of the Foreign Service was an unthinkable prospect to me, taking into
                    account where I was growing up during the &gt;40s and &gt;50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school? Let's talk about grammar
                        schoofirst.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I went to grammar school in a suburb of Chicago, Park Ridge.
                    Curiously enough, we lived two blocks away from another person who went on to
                    somewhat different pursuits in Washington, Hillary Rodham, as we knew her at
                    that time. Hillary was, in fact, younger, of course, than I was, but she was a
                    childhood playmate of my sister's. My sister, however, does not have a
                    particularly fond memory of Hillary Rodham. As my sister has told me, AI really
                    didn't like Hillary very much because she wanted to run everything.” So those
                    childhood memories obviously have enduring meaning for some people. But it was a
                    comfortable, serene, affluent Chicago suburbC secluded and parochial in many
                    ways (as Mrs. Clinton has remembered it publicly too). I went to grammar school
                    locally and then on to high school at Maine High School, in a neighboring
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about early reading habits and interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, my early interests in those formative years during the '40s
                    and '50s were dominated very heavily by competitive team sports, a passion I
                    guess inherited from my father. My main sports interests were football and
                    baseball, and I did reasonably well in both those pursuits in the various youth
                    and high school leagues. Intellectually, I was I guess pretty successful at
                    school but my reading interests did not extend much beyond classroom
                    requirements and the conservative political tomes which my parents encouraged (I
                    remember Bill Buckley=s GOD AND MAN AT YALE making a big impression on me). Also
                    one of the things that I sort of inherited from my mother was a great interest
                    in writing. At the age of 10, 11, 12, I was writing my own little detective
                    stories and adventures stories that werecirculated widely around the local
                    community. The passion for the written word and putting well crafted sentences
                    on paper continues to this day. I really learned a lot from my mother, who was
                    herself a proficient writer who returned to journalism briefly before her
                    untimely death at age 47.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in high school? What courses were you
                        concentrating on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I was focused on university preparation during my high school
                    years and taking a fairly general college prep program. I was probably most
                    interested, I think, in history. I also - and reflecting, again, I suppose, my
                    parental interest - became very involved in journalism and took a couple of
                    journalism courses in high school and went on to become the editor of the high
                    school newspaper, the main extracurricular activity besides my sports
                    activities.</p>
                <p>Q: How did the school paper run in those days in high school? I mean, were you
                    pretty much given your head, or were the teachers sort of sitting on you?</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, shall we say, it was sort of a benign dictatorship by the
                    newspaper advisor, a young teacher, a good friend, who actually gave us
                    relatively significant latitude without ever losing control. And, we did try to
                    do a number of interesting initiatives in the high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from high school in 1959-ish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: 1959, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did politics enter into school at all, or were youC</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: You know, in this rather narrowly Republican suburb, there was
                    really not much party politics. There was certainly a rather significant level
                    of internal school politics which engaged me, primarily in my position as editor
                    of the high school newspaper. And, as I said, we tried some initiatives that
                    somewhat challenged the ordinary life of a school in the placid, conformist 50s,
                    for example, setting up what we called “honor study halls,” study halls without
                    any teacher supervision, and that was very revolutionary for the time, but it
                    worked reasonably well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all involved in such things as Junior UN
                        ointernational type? Was there much of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, in fact, one thing that sort of moved me in transition from the
                    isolationist parochial Midwest to a broader international stage was an
                    experience that I had in my senior year of my high school. I was selected for
                    the Illinois Model United Nations, a role-playing simulation exercise with other
                    high school students from across the state. And this was, for me, not only an
                    introduction to international relations, but also an engaging personal
                    experience in the dynamics of international affairs and how countries view and
                    deal with each other. It was not a simplistic, black-and-white world that I had
                    pretty much taken for granted. The experience was probably the first thing that
                    pushed me in the direction of foreign relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you graduated in '59, where were you pointed
                        towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, there is a somewhat complicated story there. I had done very
                    well in both the classroom and on the athletic field, and I was being recruited
                    by number of universities as a football player. But as a Midwestern lad growing
                    up in the Chicago area and starting to look at the world beyond, I began to have
                    the ambitions of going to, shall we say, a bigger stage, which I saw as the Ivy
                    League. And both Yale and Dartmouth were very interested in having me there
                    mainly for football, I have to admit. In the winter of 1959, I took a
                    college-sponsored recruiting trip out to Dartmouth and to Yale, the first time I
                    had ever been on an airplane or, indeed, ever traveled east of Kalamazoo. I was
                    very impressed by Dartmouth College and interested in it from both academic and
                    athletic perspectives. The problem was both my parents were graduates of
                    Northwestern University, a school which I had come to know over the years
                    because we were physically very close in the Chicago area, about 10 miles away.
                    My parents were active alumni of that distinguished private university in the
                    Midwest, perhaps the finest private university in the Middle West. But because
                    it was so close and so familiar, I really wasn=t that interested. But my parents
                    were interested. For my father, I suspect, his dream of having another
                    Northwestern athlete in the family. Northwestern had offered me a full athletic
                    scholarship, while Ivy League had a less big-time football approach and could
                    offer me only tuition. It basically came down to a dollars-and-cents decision,
                    which as a self-centered teenager, I could not understand, although now as a
                    parent of two sons, I appreciate the financial side much better. My parents
                    basically announced that I would go to Northwestern, the source of great
                    happiness and tension in the family for a while, but as a parent today, I
                    recognize the concerns of my father and mother, who still had two younger
                    children to educate. In the end, I was very pleased with my experience at
                    Northwestern. Once I got there, I might as well have been a thousand miles away;
                    I was independent and deeply engaged in my life at Northwestern. I think my
                    experience at Northwestern probably also deepened and enriched my appreciation
                    for my family and regional roots.</p>
                <p>During my four years at Northwestern, I had the opportunity to become very close
                    to my maternal grandfather, a retired journalist who lived in Evanston just a
                    few blocks from me. My Grandpa Frazier was an extraordinary individual who rose
                    from modest origins in Kansas to become an internationally recognized figure in
                    the printing and publishing industry. He had a wisdom and no-nonsense
                    perspective on the world that I am so pleased to have shared. He represented all
                    of the good values and common sense of the Midwesterner. I think, in retrospect,
                    it was healthy for me to remain in the Midwest in those years. As I've gone on
                    over the years to different parts of the world, I always had this reference
                    point in middle America and the quintessentially American values and patriotism
                    which that region reflected. If I'd gone East into the Ivy League, I might not
                    have been the same person in later years.</p>
                <p>Q: And of course, Chicago has a very honored place in the intellectual life and
                    all, “city of the big shoulders” and all, great architecture, wonderful writers
                    and all that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Oh, you were. Well then I guess you were theCQ: We left early, but
                    there's a residue of people. . . . Actually I lived in Winnetka, in that
                    area.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I know it well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about football. How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, again, I was there with the legendary Ara Parseghian, the
                    football coach who had come to Northwestern and turned around a weak football
                    program. We never went to the Rose Bowl but began to win games in the Big Ten,
                    an unusual experience for Northwestern. Ara was a gifted, charismatic coach who
                    went to greater fame at Notre Dame. My own performance was at best mixed. I did
                    well as a freshman but as time passed I began to lose interest in football. I
                    developed other interests at Northwestern, both academic and extracurricular,
                    and football never played a major role in my life, although I was grateful that
                    my academic expenses were covered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about Northwestern. AcademicsCwhat was
                        youmajor and interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I started out in liberal arts. I had a vague notion that I was
                    going to become a lawyer some day. I don=t know where that came from, but it was
                    something that I had in my mind. But it was a period of enormous change and
                    transition in my own life, particularly the tragic early death of my mother
                    during my sophomore year at Northwestern. She had been such a powerful
                    intellectual force in my life and never really appreciated that fact until she
                    was gone. As I began to look at myself and my future more seriously and moved
                    back toward the communications world. And I shifted from liberal arts into the
                    study of communications in the School of Speech at Northwestern. I ended up
                    taking a lot of political science courses, especially some work in international
                    relations, which was becoming more and more an interest to me.</p>
                <p>Q: You would have been, I guess, a sophomore during the election of 1960, which
                    engaged so many. So many of the people I've interviewed were engaged by the
                    Kennedy- Nixon thing. Did this hit you at all? Or coming from you background, I
                    would have thought that this would have. . . I mean, “Nixon's the one,” and that
                    sort of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, you're right. I was, like many young people in college and
                    elsewhere at that time, very much engaged by that election, and particularly by
                    the candidacy of John Kennedy, who seemed to exemplify youth and energy. I
                    remember a great deal of debate and discussion in my fraternity house and
                    elsewhere at Northwestern about that election. But my family loyalties rooted in
                    my Republican background in the Chicago suburban area and the Midwest, certainly
                    were with Richard Nixon. But like a lot of young people, I was unavoidably
                    impressed by this young, dashing, dynamic gentleman from Massachusetts, and the
                    spirit and enthusiasm and confidence which he exuded. The first truly 20th
                    century American presidential candidate. It was something that very much had an
                    impact on me, and I think over the next few years Kennedy and his elevation of
                    public service became a major factor in my joining the Foreign Service. Of
                    course, we also have to recall how he projected himself and his policies to the
                    country at that time. Although liberal in domestic policy, but in foreign
                    policy, his approach was clearly something that a conservative Republican could
                    support: the sense of Cold War mission, the commitment to American values in the
                    world, the resistance to the perceived danger from the Soviet UnionCall of this
                    had a resonance with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, there was that confrontation with Cuba. I mean,
                        thiwas certainly not a wishy-washy liberal type thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Absolutely, and I remember hovering in front of the television set
                    at the Sigma Chi house watching the crisis unfold and not knowing if the world
                    would erupt in an all-out nuclear war. It was a chilling experience and made me
                    appreciate more than ever how international relations can affect the lives of
                    people, even in the Midwest. I think it also helped to shape my interest in the
                    world and eventually my professional engagement and interest in the Foreign
                    Service. The Cuban Missile Crisis was something that was another defining
                    experience in my life.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that Northwestern opened up a different world, too, in that you
                    had grown up essentially in a well-to-do Midwestern suburb, gone to grade school
                    and to high school? And Northwestern, albeit, is the same area, but it was
                    drawing in people. Did you find that you were meeting a broader spectrum of
                    people at the university than you'd met before, or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, in honesty, at that time, Northwestern did not feature an
                    especially meaningful diversity of backgrounds. It has changed obviously since
                    those years, but then it was primarily a white, upper-middle-class university, a
                    product of its prohibitive cost, and before more aggressive affirmative action
                    not different than other large, top-ranked universities, including the Ivy
                    League. I don=t recall that the university itself provided me with a socially
                    expanding experience in terms of introducing me to different parts of the world.
                    In sports there, I had a fair amount of opportunity to get acquainted with
                    people from different backgrounds that were there to play football , and
                    particularly from the black community. It was a new experience for me, but
                    overalNorthwestern did not itself engage me that much with the world. I did get
                    involved in student politics while at Northwestern, but it was not, certainly,
                    one that introduced me to the broader world outside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you graduated in '63.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you graduated, what were you ready to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I think that I was still searching and absolutely certain what
                    the future held for me, so I decided to go on to graduate school. The program
                    that seemed to follow on my undergraduate work was at the master=s program in
                    communication at Boston University. I was ambiguously considering an academic
                    career, but also I still had this idea that I might go into the communication
                    field in business. But I think that at that time my life and values came under a
                    new, powerful influence and that was my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: And her influence also had a great deal to do in moving me toward
                    the international world and into the Foreign Service itself. My wife was not a
                    student at Northwestern, but I had become first acquainted as a friend during
                    high school. Although born in the U.S., she had a very European upbringing in
                    many ways. Her mother was born in Germany and came to the United States in the
                    '30s to marry my wife=s father, who was himself the son of German immigrants. A
                    European atmosphere prevailed in that household. My wife had visited Europe with
                    her family, but she herself also spent her junior year in France and had an
                    international style and interest which intrigued me. It was very different than
                    the traditional, Midwestern environment I had known my entire life. We got
                    together during the college years, literally got married a few weeks after
                    graduation, and headed toward graduate school in Boston. My wife would be a
                    teacher of French at a suburban high school. She had become the dominant force
                    in my life and we started thinking and talking about doing something
                    overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Q: What was Boston University like then? I got my master's degree there in '55
                    but that was on a GI bill and it was one year in history, and I met my wife
                    there, but how did you find Boston U. and the Boston community?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, we were actually fascinated by our overall experience in
                    Boston. We were there two years. Living the graduate student existence mostly on
                    my wife=s salary, we were certainly not rich, but we enjoyed the whole
                    atmosphere and flavor of the Boston area. Boston University had a urban campus
                    with a fairly wide range of backgrounds in its student body and exposure to the
                    city=s richly diverse multicultural population. We loved wandering the
                    neighborhoods of Boston and Cambridge and the wonderful dynamic of its two
                    dominant ethnic groups, the Irish and Italian-Americans. And we, I think, were
                    stimulated by the cultural and intellectual experience there (often going to the
                    famed Boston Symphony for its Friday afternoon concerts at just a couple of
                    dollars each). I also have this eerie memory of seeing John Kennedy on the
                    streets of Boston just a few weeks before he was killed in Texas. My wife and I
                    were walking along a street one balmy October evening and then out of nowhere
                    comes this relatively small caravan of cars with John Kennedy sitting in the
                    backseat of an open vehicle, a long way from the imperial, protected presidency
                    we would witness in later years. It was just amazing to have seen the him right
                    there on the street in Boston and I would think about it often after the
                    assassination the next month in Dallas.</p>
                <p>Living in Boston at the time when their native son was killed made the event more
                    gripping than probably anywhere else. The population was in a state of total
                    shock. While a graduate student, I worked as an advisor to the university
                    student radio station, and on the night of the assassination, I went with
                    several students down to Hyannisport, covering the aftermath from the
                    perspective there and the coming and going of people from the family there at
                    Hyannisport. There was a real sense of both history and emotional trauma, which
                    I think affected not only Massachusetts but the entire country more than we even
                    today appreciate. A good case can be made that the Kennedy assassination was
                    actually a fault line in American society that devastated the social andcultural
                    fabric of the country to produce the many years of upheaval, unrest, and
                    uprooting which followed. Our country never was the same again in many ways.
                    Maybe that=s a stretch, but life and society in the U.S. was very different
                    after November 22, 1963.</p>
                <p>Q: Your wife had been to Europe and came from her background. Were you getting
                    any feel for something like the Foreign Service or international work or Peace
                    Corps or anything like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Absolutely. I had started now to sort of look around at overseas job
                    possibilities, partly influenced by my wife. We both thought it would be
                    interesting go abroad and not get locked into a traditional, suburban, corporate
                    track. One path was the Peace Corps and I learned about the Foreign Service and
                    for the first time the U.S. Information Agency, which at the time jointly did
                    its recruiting and testing with the Department. In USIA, I saw the opportunity
                    to merge my background in communications with an interest in intentional affairs
                    and living abroad. I guess it was in the fall of 1964 that I took the Foreign
                    Service Examination. My wife and I also applied for the Peace Corps, took its
                    entrance exam, and were accepted for assignment as community development
                    specialists in Turkey. Hard to imagine what qualified us for that, but after I
                    passed the Foreign Service written test, USIA became more and more an attractive
                    option. And, I moved on to the oral exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall how the oral exam went, yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I do very well remember distinctly that it took place on an
                    exceptionally warm day in Boston, in the spring of 1965. I recall wearing this
                    very thick wool winter suit (one of the few I owned and a legacy of my
                    Midwestern winters) and sweating profusely, a condition aggravated by the fact
                    that you had these three crusty Foreign Service types all looking very sternly
                    at me and making me feel very uncomfortable over a period of, I'm sure is was,
                    at least two hours, probably longer - and not just testing my encyclopedic
                    knowledge. But the exam was mainly focused on testing me as a person and how I
                    reacted to the pressure and the different role-playing situations. It was the
                    first time I'd ever had this type of experience and it was very intimidating. I
                    was absolutely convinced that I had embarrassed myself and after the exam was
                    over, my discomfort increased by waiting forever in an adjacent, overheated
                    room. One of the testers came in and told me somewhat grudgingly that I had my
                    gaps in academic-type knowledge, but they really liked the way that I stood up
                    and defended my positions and what I stood for. Not really so impressed by my
                    performance, I was in fact accepted.</p>
                <p>But even after passing the oral, I knew there could be a prolonged delay waiting
                    until security and medical clearances were done and your name was placed on the
                    list. It was impossible to know how soon you would be called. It might be a year
                    or two, they told me, before I would enter the Foreign Service, because the
                    waiting list was long. Instead of the Peace Corps, my wife and I returned to the
                    academic option at least temporarily and I accepted a Ph.D. fellowship at the
                    University of North Carolina in the fall. We shipped off all of our meager
                    belongings (in a few trunks) to Chapel Hill and went back to Chicago and a
                    family visit after getting my master=s degree. Somehow, my name came up and I
                    unexpectedly got a call in July 1965 offering me Foreign Service officer
                    position with USIA. With little pause for reflection, I accepted and worked the
                    phone lines trying to track down our belongings somewhere in Chapel Hill, North
                    Carolina and get them transferred to Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Actually, I reported, I believe it was August of 1965 and entered
                    the A-100 course with I think about 30 people in that class, 25 State Department
                    and five USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the composition of your A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It was predominately male and white. The Foreign Service still had
                    not achieved much diversity. I think there were maybe three women in the class
                    and one African American. There was perhaps somewhat greater regional diversity
                    in the class than one would have existed ten years earlier, a fairly wide range
                    of people from across the United States although with a substantial Ivy League
                    element as well. I was one of the few Midwesterners there, and I remember in the
                    training evaluation report that the State Department officer who ran the program
                    - a quintessentially old-line FSO type - he inserted in my report that “Mr.
                    Pendergrast is very proud of his Midwestern background,” which I took as a
                    somewhat patronizing remark at this exotic creature from the Midwest suddenly
                    thrust upon the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you sense a difference between those who were going to the State
                    Department and those who were going to the Information Agency, I mean as far as
                    how you were treated, or not?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, at that time, the Foreign Service Institute and the people
                    running the A-100 program very deliberately ensured that there was no real
                    distinction between the State and USIA people in the class. It was still in 1965
                    relatively new for FSOs in State and USIA to be admitted and trained together.
                    And, I did not myself see any real difference between the two groups. My wife
                    and I had good friends in both State Department as well as USIA contingents.
                    Obviously after the six to eight weeks of the A-100 course, we moved into our
                    own training program over at USIA, but I did not perceive any partition or
                    distance between State and USIA during that period. In fact, one of our very
                    good friends in the class, a State Department officer, turned out to be,
                    tragically, one of the Service=s most infamous members, Brad Bishop, who later
                    in the 1970s killed his whole family at his Maryland home and disappeared. And
                    there were subsequent reports, I gather, of people who ran into him in Europe.
                    My wife and I were shocked by what happened because we had looked up to Brad and
                    his wife. They were somewhat older and had some experience overseas. One of the
                    reasons that we got to know them a little bit is that he was a Serbo-Croat
                    language speaker in his army intelligence days, and so he knew something about
                    Yugoslavia, which was my first assignment. We got acquainted with them and found
                    them an exceptionally engaging, friendly and wonderful couple. What happened
                    later just staggers our imagination. It was certainly nothing that seemed even
                    remotely possible back in 1965 and 1966. We lost touch with them after that
                    time. Something must have happened. He snapped and the rest is a disaster.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were coming out, you went into training at USIA.
                        Whadid that training consist of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, at the time, USIA had a special program for its new FSOs that
                    consisted, I recall, of about six to eight weeks where we were given sort of a
                    complete survey of the different programs that USIA conducted, a basic survey of
                    operations from broadcasting and motion pictures to publications and exchanges,
                    which at that time were still administered in Washington by the State Department
                    (and overseas by USIA). So we got a detailed, comprehensive picture of what USIA
                    did overseas through this training program. It was still, I think, a pretty
                    heady time in USIA soon after the tenure of Edward R. Murrow as director of
                    USIA. He had brought to the Agency the New Frontier-type idealism and sense of
                    mission, which was clearly evident and I think sustained well by his two
                    immediate successors, Carl Rowan and Leonard Marks. Rowan was himself a
                    prominent and respected journalist. USIA had other very talented people who came
                    to Washington with the New Frontier spirit, notably George Stevens, Jr., the son
                    of the legendary director, who was the head of the film and television service,
                    and in fact was responsible for the famous film, Days of Lightning, Years of
                    Drums, which won an Academy Award.</p>
                <p>But at the time USIA=s banner was flying high not only because of the Murrow
                    legacy, but also because of John Kennedy himself, who believed that the Agency
                    had the potential to do something really worthwhile in support of U.S. foreign
                    policy, particularly in the developing world, carrying the American message to
                    countries throughout the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were going through this, when you and your wife
                        joined up - and I include your wife because, as we all know, this is a team
                        business, particularly in those days (I'm not sure if it is today) - but
                        were you pointed towards anywhere? Did you want to go any particular
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, unlike, I suppose, many people in my class, I had no real
                    interest in any particular part of the world and did not make any effort to
                    lobby or otherwise point myself toward a particular country or region. It
                    reflected in large part, I suppose, my background and lack of any real previous
                    experience with any particular region or country. My wife, had background in
                    Germany and France, but I didn't have any strong inclination. I just basically
                    was prepared to take what they had to offer me.</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, we were basically told where we were going to go on our first
                    assignment late in our A-100 training, and I was informed that my first
                    assignment would be in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, preceded by six months in
                    Serbo-Croatian language training. At the time, I knew virtually nothing about
                    Yugoslavia, but it was in Europe (I guess I knew that), and given my
                    conservative anticommunist family background, it was sort of interesting that I
                    was being assigned to a country which was nominally communist, but I had no
                    really strong feelings about the posting. I just accepted it and went into my
                    training for Yugoslavia with, I think, a good measure of enthusiasm just eager
                    to get on with a real job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you take your language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, curiously, I first went through area studies. But because
                    Yugoslavia was not in the Soviet Bloc, the Department in its wisdom and
                    political rigidity insisted that I could not go to the Eastern Europe course.
                    And, it wasn=t Western Europe either, so for bureaucratic reasons beyond my
                    humble comprehension I was sent to the Near East studies course (rationalized I
                    guess my Yugoslavia=s Moslem minority), which was interesting but virtually
                    useless for Yugoslavia. But I did my duty for three weeks and then went on to my
                    Foreign Service Institute language class in the old Arlington Towers
                    building-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the garage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: -in the garage, a claustrophobic windowless room, in the
                    Serbo-Croatian training program. My wife and I took the course together. We were
                    the only two in that class with the instructor, an old, crusty, Serbian cavalry
                    officer, who was somewhat intimidating, particularly for my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vladimir Popovic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, right, Mr. Popovic, known and loved by many generations of
                    Serbo-Croatian students. And there were more than a few occasions when his
                    gruff, chauvinistic ways wore heavily on my wife, who then exited in tears. She
                    deserves a Foreign Service prize for staying with it for six months. Part of the
                    problem was the fact that my wife had no background in any Slavic language
                    before. I had taken Russian both in high school and college and had a foundation
                    on which to build readily Serbo-Croatian. The language came fairly easily to me
                    not to my wife, who struggled with those Slavic consonant combinations and the
                    Cyrillic alphabet. I became unfairly impatient with her at times. We like to
                    recall now that we probably never came closer to divorce than those six months
                    in Serbo-Croatian language training with Vladimir Popovic.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Q: I took it from Popovic about five years or four years before, and we're
                    talking now in 1959, and I think I got to understand the Serb mentality in that
                    time with him, and I've drawn on it ever since, not so much the language but to
                    understand what you're up against. It's very important today.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Oh, absolutely. He did perfectly exemplify the Serbian cultural
                    character that endures to this day: a defiant, stubborn, even obstinate approach
                    to life blended with extraordinary courage and sense of principle. And we
                    remember his stories about riding on horseback to attack the attacking German
                    tanks. And I could absolutely visualize him and his Serbian calvary troops doing
                    just that. This is the mentality of the Serbs: fearsome, violent, sometimes
                    foolhardy and unrealistic. It was why the Serbs have survived over the centuries
                    as many invaders passed across their land.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get to Belgrade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I arrived in Belgrade in June, 1966. I went ahead of my wife on this
                    trip because she had some dental work to be done in Chicago before she could go.
                    I was expected out there in June. So I went alone. I flew into Munich and picked
                    up our new Volkswagen, the first vehicle my wife and I ever owned, and then
                    drove down to Belgrade. And this was a culturally interesting experience for a
                    young Midwestern boy who had never been east of Kalamazoo before the age of 18.
                    To arrive alone in the center of Europe and then proceed down into the Balkans
                    was a culturally defining experience. I remember driving down through Austria
                    and arriving the first night in Graz, a provincial Austrian town. Late at night,
                    I ended up in a hotel which had an old, rusty elevator that barely could creep
                    up through this rather seedy hotel environment. Not being able to sleep,
                    stricken by culture shock and jet lag, I got back in the car when it was still
                    dark and just plunged into Yugoslavia, where it was even more of a cultural
                    shock - a cold splash of culture that lives with me to this day. I remember the
                    first night I spent in a so-called “motel” along the Belgrade-Zagreb highway and
                    spent the night listening to the these strange sounds from the night club, the
                    drunken shouts of the exuberant Serbs and their music, the eerie rhythmic folk
                    music of Serbia that signaled a very different world than what I knew in
                    suburban Chicago. I couldn=t sleep again and dazed by the shock of the new
                    culture, I took off early and arrived well before the embassy opened in
                    Belgrade. The Marine on duty didn't know quite what to do with this new USIA
                    junior officer arriving at the doorstep before 7 am in the morning and what do
                    we do with him? Well, I ended up being parked in the American Club and waited
                    until somebody would arrive and take me under their charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Belgrade from '66 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I was in Belgrade for only a few months. I expected to have a
                    full tour of three years. The normal pattern for USIA would be rotational type
                    of training within different sections of USIA for a year and then move into a
                    regular position for two years. But in the curious workings of the Foreign
                    Service, I was detoured. My wife arrived, of course, a few weeks later, and we
                    were both living there at the time, not in temporary housing, but in a hotel,
                    the old, somewhat seedy Hotel Majestic, itself a cultural experience. We were
                    beginning to adapt to life in Belgrade and meet people, both Americans and
                    Yugoslavs. We looked forward to permanent housing. However, it turns out that
                    the consul general in Zagreb, the new consul general, Bob Owen, who had several
                    children of school age, wanted to start a new American school in Zagreb and got
                    support from the Department's overseas school division. He learned that my wife
                    was a teacher by background and experience, and thought that this was a
                    conveniently placed resource he wanted for his school. So in the infinite wisdom
                    of the Foreign Service assignment process, he arranged through USIA in Belgrade
                    and Washington to have me transferred to Zagreb. My wife became in effect the
                    first teacher and principal of the American School of Zagreb. And so in
                    September of 1966, I was transferred up to Zagreb for the rest of my assignment
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: -to early '69.</p>

                        therin '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Zagreb was a beautiful city with a distinctly Central European,
                    Mitteleuropa atmosphere. It had not suffered any serious damage during World War
                    II, unlike Belgrade and many cities in Yugoslavia, and retained a lot of the old
                    European charm. The Austro-Hungarian influence was still very prominent there.
                    It had, of course, as in most communist societies, a certain seediness and lack
                    of “modernity” common throughout Eastern Europe, but there was a charm and sense
                    of history that intrigued me and my wife. We were fortunate to move immediately
                    into housing there in the old Gornji Grad, the old town of Zagreb, an apartment
                    itself closely identified with Croatian nationalism. The apartment had been
                    formerly occupied by Ivan Mestrovic, the famous Croatian �migr� sculptor who had
                    left after World War II and eventually died in the United States. He was a
                    strong Croatian nationalist, and his spirit was very much felt in that apartment
                    as well as right next door, which was the Mestrovic museum. And our apartment
                    looked down on the courtyard of the museum, and we felt very much a part of
                    Croatia and of that whole community. Croatians loved to visit our place. It was
                    almost like coming to a historical monument, a political act at a time when
                    Croat nationalism was discouraged and even brutally suppressed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: He was a student of Rodin and had the same style. We were very taken
                    with it. The apartment, of course, with tall ceilings and no central heating -
                    heated by these old ceramic stoves that had to be rekindled every cold winter
                    morning. And there was a strong case to be made that the apartment, literally,
                    was haunted by the ghost of Mestrovic's past. He had - I'm not certain of the
                    exact circumstances - either left or divorced his wife. But his wife, we were
                    told, lived on in that apartment long after he had left. In fact, she refused to
                    leave. According to legend, she still occupied that apartment, which after a
                    while we were not prepared to challenge. On at least several occasions that
                    clearly could not be explained, the double doors to our bedroom slammed open in
                    the middle of the night. We were jolted from our sleep and seeing no chance for
                    wind or something else to cause the incident, we began to wonder if we were in
                    fact the apartment=s only occupants. On a couple of other occasions, we also
                    heard someone walking around the apartment on the creaking old wood floor. Maybe
                    there was some natural explanation for it all, but because my wife and I both
                    witnessed these things, it was not our imagination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you mix with the people there and deal with the
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, we had an absolutely wonderful experience getting to know the
                    people of Zagreb and across Croatia as well as Slovenia, at that time part of
                    our consular district. We traveled up there about once every two weeks to do the
                    USIA work there. We developed very good friends in the Zagreb community,
                    primarily in the educational and cultural fields, which is where USIA did a
                    large part of its work. Despite the superstructure of a communist state, there
                    was a remarkable openness to Americans in Croatia - and really throughout most
                    of Yugoslavia. Very rarely would we encounter any type of real overt
                    anti-Americanism or communist ideology, usually among provincial apparatchiks
                    who were insecure and fled to the safety of ideological rigidity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find an anti-Serbian aura there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Absolutely. Both in my experience in Zagreb and during my short time
                    in Belgrade, I observed first hand the fierce regional and sectarian feelings
                    which were so powerful, even in the late 1960s, and which, of course, deepened
                    over the years. The Croatians had a deeply rooted sense of grievance and the
                    perception that they were being persecuted by a Serbian-dominated Yugoslav
                    government. Nationalism was just below the surface everywhere in Croatia, even
                    among younger people, who had not experienced the war and the violent conflicts
                    which took place then. Even among the generation which knew only Yugoslavia and
                    the Titoist dream of a united, multi-ethnic nation, Croat nationalism simmered,
                    particularly in the universities, the students, the intellectuals. But even when
                    Tito clinched his iron fist, it was clearly evident in the late 60s that
                    nationalism was not going to die. Many of the young professors we got to know
                    then became part of a Croatian cultural uprising, I believe, in 1972 that was
                    brutally put down by the Yugoslav government. They extinguished this bubble of
                    Croatian nationalism, but anybody who knew Croatia at the time fully understood
                    that nationalism would outlive Tito eventually. It wasn't just Croatian
                    nationalism that was brewing. In the same period were the first major Albanian
                    riots in Kosovo against Serbian rule there. Even in Serbia, Tito had to move
                    against an alleged Serbian nationalist conspiracy led by Rankovic and the people
                    around the Serbian-dominated intelligence services. Tito always seemed to play
                    off one nationality against the other so well, but his main weapon was brute
                    force and the loyalty of the army that was perhaps the only real Yugoslav
                    institution.</p>
                <p>Tito mixed both accommodation and repression. In the early 70s, perhaps
                    recognizing that the nationalist fires were erupting everywhere, he moved toward
                    significantly greater decentralization that granted considerable republic and
                    provincial autonomy. The central role of the party and Tito=s rule did not
                    relax, but the institutions of republican independence were put in place,
                    something that certainly led to the final breakup of the country in the 1990s.
                    But the anti-Serb animosity my wife and I observed in Zagreb was something
                    almost pathological. I came to the conclusion then that a united Yugoslavia
                    would never last. My only surprise is that after the death of Tito in 1980,
                    Yugoslavia held together, even precariously, for another decade. The nationalist
                    feelings were so intense that even some Foreign Service nationals who worked for
                    us, Croatians, refused to speak on the telephone with their Serb counterparts at
                    the embassy in Belgrade. They worked for the same U.S. government, the same
                    programs, but none of that could overcome the mistrust and antagonism which
                    history had created, something that has haunted Yugoslavia certainly from its
                    origins in 1919 until today.</p>
                <p>Q: It's interesting, because you were getting this. I spent five years in
                    Belgrade - we overlapped slightly ( left in '67) - and we sort of picked up the
                    Serbian view and didn=t really capture the intensity of feelings in Zagreb, and
                    I think in Zagreb, I think we felt that, well, these are country cousins, they
                    don't really understand, and all that. Did you capture this division between the
                    embassy and the consulate general?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I think that... Are you talking about it in thofficial
                    American community?</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the official American community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I think, frankly, that there was some distance between the consulate
                    and the embassy on the issue of Yugoslavia with the embassy clearly inclined to
                    emphasize a unified Yugoslavia and did not really appreciate the strong
                    nationalist impulses which we in the consulate observed everyday. I don=t recall
                    any major crises in the relationships of consulate and the embassy, but I know
                    the Americans in the two places had very different perspectives about the
                    country, which is perhaps inevitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that time was Bob Owen the consul general the whole
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: He was the whole time, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about his background and how he
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, he was, I think, a congenial, soft-spoken, competent career
                    FSO, but as a very junior officer I didn't really have much to do with him. My
                    wife had more direct contact with him in her American School capacity. He didn=t
                    get actively involved in the USIA programs, but the school was his passion. With
                    my wife as the teacher, it was essentially a one-room classroom with about 15
                    students, including the consul general=s children.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about your activities. In the first place, did you have a
                    supervisor, an information officer who was ahead of you, and what were you all
                    doing?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, I had two branch public affairs officers during my tenure
                    there, Milos Pitak and later Charles Johnson. Both were from that older
                    generation of USIA officers whose formative career experience was dominated by
                    Germany where USIS had a major role both in the occupation and in the 1950s. I
                    had basically good working relationships with both of them, but as a young
                    Foreign Service officer, I had different contacts, different approaches to
                    things. But overall my experience in Zagreb was good and offered a range of
                    activity and responsibility I probably would not have had if I stayed in
                    Belgrade at the embassy. I learned a great deal, largely from hands-on
                    experience running a variety of programs, from education and cultural exchanges
                    to exhibits and press programs, and I thought it was a very good first
                    assignment for me. I also benefited tremendously from some highly competent
                    local employees and as I saw many times over the years how much the United
                    States benefited from the dedication, talent, and energy of its Foreign Service
                    national employees.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, it ran the full gamut of cultural and educational exchanges,
                    including lectures by visiting Americans, arranging trips by Yugoslav students
                    and faculty members to the United States, organizing exhibits of various kinds -
                    obviously, the non-political activities had greatest potential in that type of
                    political environment, which often meant doing things on the American space
                    program, something with great interest to the Yugoslavs. It was a time - in the
                    mid-60s - that the superiority of the American space program over the Soviets
                    was beginning to surface, which had a lot of powerful political messages to
                    project for us in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>We also worked to some degree in the press area distributing various publications
                    - trying wherever possible to stretch the limits of the political reality in
                    Yugoslavia and Croatia. We were of course constantly monitored by the
                    authorities to keep us from moving into sensitive areas, which in the Yugoslav
                    context usually meant anything critical of either communism or the Soviet Union.
                    Indeed, anything remotely related to socialism or any socialist country.</p>
                <p>But I had a rewarding and wide-ranging experience there. Perhaps the most
                    exciting was what we were able to do in the area of the performing arts. At the
                    time the U.S. government and the State Department were still significantly
                    committed to the performing arts in the world. The program has declined in both
                    policy and budgetary support in recent years, but my experience in Yugoslavia
                    and in other assignments demonstrated the enormous impact of these programs on
                    the values and attitudes of people, especially in closed societies. We
                    organized, for example, the visit by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, and
                    one marveled at the audience sitting spellbound watching this world-famous
                    American orchestra conducted by an Indian immigrant, Zubin Mehta, and with the
                    featured pianist, an African American, Andr� Watts. The political and cultural
                    messages projected to the audience is something you cannot underestimate.</p>
                <p>But it wasn't just big-ticket items. There were other things that we organized on
                    a more modest scale. I remember particularly the visit by a student theater
                    group from Kansas University, very gifted young people from the American
                    Heartland, who put on segments of various plays during this State Department
                    sponsored tour. In watching the audiences, particularly the young Yugoslavs, as
                    they were captivated by the energy and the talent and the vitality of these
                    young Americans - there was a clear message there about the strength and
                    character of a free society. A compelling message not lost in the socialist
                    societies. Cultural diplomacy was absolutely critical in what the United States
                    was doing in those countries during the &gt;60s and into the '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No doubt about it. Were the Soviets doing anything that
                        yonoticed there in your type of work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It was very limited. They had a large cultural center in Belgrade,
                    which I understand was fairly active, but in Zagreb and in Croatia, there as a
                    much lower profile by the Soviets. Part of this, again, may have been reflecting
                    the cultural divergence within Yugoslavia itself. Belgrade and Serbia, of
                    course, had a much stronger attachment to Russia historically and culturally.
                    The Red Army had liberated Belgrade at the end of World War II, and there was, I
                    think, a much stronger association in Belgrade and Serbia with Russia than we
                    found in Zagreb, a region historically connected with Central Europe and, of
                    course, as we know, they also had a very close identity with Germany during
                    World War II itself. There was, I believe, a much stronger anti-Soviet sentiment
                    within Croatia and Slovenia than you found in southern parts of Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the fascist r�gime that took over in Croatia - was
                        there muctalk about that in Zagreb at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It was a very sensitive point of conversation within the Zagreb
                    cultural community. There's no doubt that many of the people in Croatia were
                    both embarrassed by what had happened during World War II but also defensive by
                    stressing the excesses of the Partisans, which they believed prompted a lot of
                    the Croatian Ustashi atrocities. It was a very uncomfortable reality for the
                    Croatians because the Croatian state in World War II was inevitably linked to
                    the Croatian identity and national culture.</p>
                <p>One of the things which directly affected us in the consulate on a day-to-day
                    basis was that during the World War II Ustase period in Croatia, they
                    deliberately manipulated the language to emphasize particular terms that were
                    uniquely Croatian compared to the general Serbo-Croatian that officially
                    predominated in Yugoslavia. So there was a certain terminology that had an
                    Ustase ring to it to people as they read it. In the consulate, our official
                    translator in USIS was a person sympathetic to this old Ustase era terminology
                    (not for political reasons but through a strong sense of Croatian separatism),
                    and as a result, if we didn't watch too closely, he would put out translations
                    that had this terminology, which could be a public relations problem for us in
                    the Yugoslav environment. Of course, what has happened, I believe, is that since
                    Croatia has resumed its independence in the 1990s, a lot of that old Ustase-era
                    terminology has come back into use. Language always has more political and
                    cultural content than just communicating words and sentences.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The exposure to Slovenia further deepened our awareness of the great diversity of
                    Yugoslavia and, indeed, one could argue, the almost impossible unity of that
                    country. Slovenia, even more than Croatia, was very Western, very Central
                    European in its culture. English was already a very common language there, much
                    more than anywhere else in Yugoslavia. In both the appearance of the people as
                    well as in the towns and cities of Slovenia, there was an unmistakable Western
                    character, which the Slovenes quietly and deliberately cultivated. They were
                    part of Yugoslavia, and they paid appropriate homage to the political reality of
                    Yugoslav unity, but they were a very different than what you would find anywhere
                    else in the country.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have problems with former Croatians who went to the United States,
                    became Americans and then came back and were trying to upset things? I mean,
                    basically promulgate nationalism or-</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: In terms of people coming back, there was no problem because these
                    anticommunist Croatian �migr�s in that period would not risk coming back, but
                    they were active abroad (including in the U.S.) and there was occasional
                    violence against official Yugoslav missions and diplomats. Undoubtedly, there
                    were covert connections between Croatians and the �migr�s abroad which promoted
                    Croatian separatism, but I don't think that they were at that point, in the
                    '60s, a major force. I think the primary impulse to Croatian nationalism and
                    separatism still was very indigenous, largely associated with the intellectual
                    and educational community. You did not see it very much in the working class or
                    the rural and peasant communities, where I think the loyalty to the Yugoslav
                    idea remained fairly strong. Life was generally better for these groups compared
                    to their prewar condition. But certainly among the intelligentsia and the more
                    educated, professional class in Croatia, nationalism was a strong force already
                    beginning to build in the '60s and, of course, eventually would gain momentum
                    during the &gt;70s and &gt;80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Kosovo ring any... Was it a force, or not, or was
                        thipretty much Serbia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I think the impact on Croatia was that the riots that took
                    place in Kosovo in 1968 against Serbian domination of that province resonated
                    considerably within Croatia. They could at least silently sympathize with
                    Albanian resistance to Serbian domination. As time went along over the years, I
                    have no doubt that there was a dynamic of anti-Serb feeling playing out in
                    different parts of the country: Kosovo, Croatia, parts of Bosnia, Slovenia.
                    Perhaps no organized conspiracy, but the perception of a Serb-dominated
                    Yugoslavia ran deep through the country. Tito was able to contain it through
                    both power and concession, but his successors could not. My judgment is that the
                    Yugoslav ideal had modest potential after World War I, but central government
                    became too closely identified with the Serbian monarchy and nation. The
                    sectarian, cultural, and regional divergences deepened and then fragmented badly
                    in World War II. Tito was able through brutality and raw power to rebuild the
                    facade of Yugoslavism, but it was an unstable structure constructed on a
                    foundation of dictatorship. Many people - including in the U.S. government -
                    were misled by the illusion and nature of Yugoslav unity. And, even today, we
                    continue to have this typically romantic American notion of a multiethnic,
                    multicultural democracy in the areas of the former Yugoslavia. I am not
                    optimistic. And, it troubles me that we flood treasure and personnel into places
                    like Bosnia and Kosovo in this naive aspiration to create harmony among people
                    totally divided by history, culture, and religion. I am surprised that both the
                    Bush and Clinton Administrations did not listen more to people who had a better
                    sense of the on-the-ground reality in the Balkans. Not only there but elsewhere
                    I=ve watched in the world, including Vietnam, Americans have this chronic,
                    largely well-meaning tendency to try and substitute our own commitment,
                    technology, and power for the deficiencies in the local community, a form of
                    myopic cultural arrogance that historically has always afflicted imperial
                    nations, but often is their main vulnerability.</p>
                <p>Q: During this period, starting from the Kennedy time but carrying on, there was
                    a great emphasis on reaching out to young people, particularly at the university
                    level, and here you are. I mean you're the youngest one around, I guess. Were
                    you working at the university?</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I did a lot of work with students and other youth groups across
                    Croatia and Slovenia. And it was a very rewarding experience. Because in large
                    part oJohn Kennedy (who really had an impact across Eastern Europe), but also I
                    think just generally, we exuded to young people a society of openness, energy
                    and dynamism with which they clearly identified with. And one of my most unhappy
                    experiences in Zagreb, but also to some degree inspiring, was the reaction to
                    the assassination of Bobby Kennedy in 1968. His murder evoked all of the
                    feelings that had been experienced i'63; the grief and shock were absolutely
                    overwhelming. I remember that we put a small, black-bordered picture of Bobby
                    Kennedy in the consulate window, and spontaneously the local people were putting
                    flowers and candles on the sidewalk to create a shrine to the assassinated
                    senator that flooded into the street. People were stopping and praying at all
                    hours of the day and night. A type of unsanctioned demonstration rarely seen in
                    that part of the world. What encouraged me was that there did not seem to be any
                    backlash feeling against the United States itself or a culture of violence
                    there, although the official communist media liked to play that tune. I think
                    the Croatians for the most part did not really hold American society at fault.
                    They realized that this was the act of a demented individual who did not
                    represent American society and culture, not alter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Vietnam war? How did that play for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, Vietnam provided another landmark event in my experience in
                    Zagreb, the first time that I came face to face with a violent form of
                    anti-Americanism, although not really reflective of the people in Zagreb or
                    Yugoslavia generally. In that period, Yugoslavia officially tried to exhibit at
                    least a superficial fraternal attitude toward their comrades in Vietnam,
                    particularly in their media coverage and government pronouncements. In 1967,
                    they organized an officially sanctioned demonstration against American bombing
                    in North Vietnam, which ended up as planned in front of our consulate. The
                    orchestrated slogans, however, suddenly deteriorated when a handful of hotheads,
                    probably just hooligan kids, decided to launch a stone and firebomb attack on
                    the consulate. For a short time, we feared that the building would be burned or
                    penetrated by the protesters. The situation had simply got out of hand and we
                    cowered in the consulate secure area trying to seek help from the local
                    authorities. Just as the mob began to get into the ground floor, the government
                    responded and the police intervened. But for a young Foreign Service officer
                    never exposed before to such violence and rage, it was a pretty frightening
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come across in your contacts at the university
                        debates oarguments on Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, the subject rarely arose in my contacts across Croatia with
                    student or other university groups. You might run into it against an apparatchik
                    type at a university, someone who just trying to follow the proper ideological
                    line, but in everyday contacts it rarely came up. Vietnam to me was a very
                    distant, not terribly relevant fact of life, not knowing then that I would end
                    up and experience Vietnam first hand. But at that time it was not something that
                    I really thought about very much other than embracing the conventional position
                    that we were there to defend against a communist threat to that society, but it
                    was not something that I or the Yugoslavs wanted to discuss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, we might stop at this point. You left in '69,
                        ithat right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Early 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I'll just put at the end of the tape, where did you
                        go, swe'll know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, in early '69, I was assigned to Vietnam, preceded by 10 months
                    of Vietnamese language training. I left Yugoslavia earlier than we anticipated
                    because at that time, USIA, as well as other agencies, were rapidly increasing
                    their personnel in Vietnam. I left Yugoslavia with great reluctance. My wife and
                    I had traveled through most parts of the country and were captivated by the
                    extraordinary beauty of the country as well as the spirit and hospitality of its
                    diverse peoples. It is a fascinating country touched often tragically by history
                    and by the complex mix of cultures and religions. I could not think of a more
                    interesting place to start off a Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>And, for a young FSO, I was able to have direct exposure on a number of occasions
                    to one of the giants of world history in the 20th century, Josip Broz Tito. He
                    was a man of extraordinary charisma, self-confidence, and authority, which helps
                    to explain how he held that country together. Just as we were getting ready to
                    leave Zagreb, we were staying at the Hotel Intercontinental on New Years 1969
                    and we were coming back exhausted from a party around two in morning. But who
                    comes storming through the lobby with his entourage but Tito headed toward
                    another party in the hotel ballroom. I learned he kept going the entire night.
                    He was a leader of incredible vitality and energy. As well as appetites. His
                    weakness for women and whiskey were well known, but he seemed to survive
                    everybody.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The 29th of July, 1999, Dell, you started Vietnamese
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I started my Vietnamese training in early 1969. I believe it was
                    February. There were colleagues of mine who had been assigned to Vietnam, I
                    recall, and actively resisted the assignment and in a couple of cases resigned
                    because they did not want to go to Vietnam. I wasn=t enthusiastic about the
                    posting, but I accepted it. Curiously, when I joined the Foreign Service in
                    1965, my draft board in Illinois had generously exempted me from military
                    service (which most draft boards in that era did not do for FSOs), but I ended
                    up in Vietnam anyway.</p>
                <p>When I started in Vietnamese language training, I had general sympathy for the
                    U.S. position in Vietnam. I had abandoned my family=s Midwestern isolationism
                    inherited from my parents, replaced by a passionate internationalism shaped a
                    great deal by John Kennedy, who inspired so many people in my generation. But I
                    think my Foreign Service experience and sharpened sense of history made me
                    conscious of America=s global responsibilities. The U.S. had been reluctant to
                    enter the two world wars and the results were tragic. We could and should not
                    walk away from Southeast Asia. So I was basically disposed toward the
                    assignment, although obviously with no background at all in Asia or anything to
                    do with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>During my ten months of language training, I had extensive area and country
                    studies, which gave me a lot of badly needed education about the region. And, I
                    think my views started to evolve and shift even while still in Washington. It
                    was partly my exposure to the intense antiwar feeling taking place in the United
                    States, which I had not experienced while in Yugoslavia. I had not fully
                    appreciated the depth of opposition that existed in the United States, and that
                    inevitably did have some impact on me. I remember in the fall of 1969 the
                    Moratorium, a major event in the antiwar movement that turned violent in
                    Washington. Even some of my Vietnamese language classmates, who were going to
                    Vietnam, participated in the Moratorium, which was a little bit beyond my reach
                    at that point. I think there was another thing that helped to shape my attitudes
                    towards Vietnam, and that was a deepening concern about a blind, stubborn faith
                    in American technology and power to win the war. I began to question the widely
                    held belief that American military and political power alone could make the
                    difference in the war, a self-deception which afflicted many in the government
                    and the military. My reaction was partly developed by exposure to the swaggering
                    Vietnam hands, civilian and military, who came back and forth through the
                    Vietnam training center at the time. They had a rather patronizing attitude
                    toward the Vietnamese, which I found disturbing and offensive. Such people
                    seemed to think it was our war and we were going to win it regardless of the
                    Vietnamese, another form of the myopic cultural arrogance which I mentioned
                    earlier. I was by no means a dove or opponent of the war. Its basic strategic
                    goals were sound, but before I even arrived there, I had become nervous about
                    the way and the people implementing our strategy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Vietnamese as a language, as a tonal language? How
                        diyou find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I had never experienced anything like it, because my language
                    background was entirely in the Slavic family, but actually I seemed to adapt
                    pretty well to it. I never became really fluent, but I managed at the
                    professional level. I never needed an interpreter and was able to travel
                    unescorted around the countryside. The tonal language is major, unfamiliar
                    challenge for any American, but once you master the tones, you really are in
                    control, because the grammar, the structure, tends to be simple, certainly
                    compared to a Slavic language. So as I look back over the languages that I've
                    studied over the many years, Vietnamese was possibly the easiest. But that's
                    maybe because I was still young and able to adapt to languages much better than
                    I could later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember, were you married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, I was. I was married, and my wife initially decided that she
                    would go to Bangkok and spend the time there because, of course, they were not
                    allowing families into Vietnam during that period. In the end, she became
                    pregnant with our first child and decided to stay with her mother in Chicago. In
                    retrospect, it was a good decision, because the home environment was better for
                    her in the pregnancy and then for the birth of our son. And it worked out, I
                    think, pretty well. I=m glad that later she was able to come and visit me in
                    Vietnam for a couple of weeks to get a taste of my experience there.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any problem with your wife? This is a question I ask of people
                    because often the wives were subjected more... I mean, you had your work to do,
                    you knew what you were going to do and you were a government officer and all,
                    but the wives were out kind of in... I'm talking about in the American public,
                    and they were getting an awful lot more pressure. I know my wife did.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: You mean during the Vietnam period.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, during the Vietnam thing. My wife was at a university while I was in
                    Vietnam, and I came back and I found it wasn't very easy.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, she had no problem being identified with someone working in
                    Vietnam. She lived in a conservative North Shore suburb of Chicago. I don't
                    think there was any strong anti-war feeling there. In fact, her main complaint,
                    I recall, was the paucity of information about Vietnam and the lack of interest
                    among the people she knew in that area. She read the Chicago Tribune and other
                    local papers, but, remarkably, in the middle of the war, the information was
                    spotty. She was getting letters from me almost daily from Vietnam and her
                    curiosity was stimulated, but she could not get much satisfaction in the local
                    media.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Q: I remember on my way out trying to find something on what was happening in
                    Vietnam, and I was in Houston, and there was, you know, a paragraph. The papers,
                    when you get beyond sort of The Washington Post, The New York Times, maybe The
                    Los Angeles Times, you're in another world.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: You're absolutely right, and she really did feel being in a sort of
                    information vacuum, but she was distracted by her first pregnancy, and when my
                    son was born while I was in Vietnam, and she was quite fully occupied.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: In January of 1970, and I was assigned by USIA in Saigon to be an
                    advisor, what they called a psychological operations advisor to the Vietnamese
                    government, in a province northwest of Saigon called Tay Ninh, approximately 60
                    to 70 miles northwest of the capital city. It had been in the '60s a very
                    prominent battleground between the communists and the South Vietnamese
                    government, the site of the infamous War Zone C, which was a vast stretch of
                    largely uninhabited jungle that had become a major base for the communist
                    forces. I was based in the province capital with the province advisory team and
                    worked with the Vietnamese information service located in Tay Ninh.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I was the advisor to the Vietnamese information service assisting
                    them in the propaganda effort supporting the war. The situation in Tay Ninh was
                    complicated because that province is the center of the Cao Dai religion, the
                    largest indigenous Vietnamese religion. It is - at least at the time - a
                    religion that numbered, I guess, three to four million people, primarily in Tay
                    Ninh and along the central coast of Vietnam. It's an extraordinary,
                    quintessentially Vietnamese religion which is eclectic and the elements of
                    different faiths, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, and animism. And
                    it also tends to be very hierarchical and authoritarian, organized along the
                    lines of the Roman Catholic Church, with a pope, cardinals and bishops, and at
                    that time they had a very powerful hold over Tay Ninh. The province government
                    and military structure was essentially a Cao Dai structure. And so what we were
                    working with was not just the Vietnamese government representative, but indeed
                    with the Cao Dai, which rippled the whole fabric of the provincial system. In
                    many ways, of course, that was a great advantage, because the Cao Dai were
                    fiercely anticommunist. Their loyalty to Saigon over the years had been mixed,
                    but at that time in the early &gt;70s they pretty well accommodated to the
                    national government, which allowed them a fair degree of autonomy in Tay
                    Ninh.</p>
                <p>What my job entailed was working with my counterpart, the head of the Vietnamese
                    information service, who was of course a well-connected Cao Dai figure, in a
                    variety of information and cultural activities ranging from publications and
                    cultural events and entertainment staged in villages to promote government
                    themes as well as small village libraries and information centers across the
                    province. Increasingly, I began to feel it was rather patronizing to believe
                    that somehow we Americans could tell the Vietnamese how to communicate with
                    their own people. I was a little uncomfortable with that, but my main value, I
                    suppose, was helping in contacts with regional and national headquarters to get
                    needed resources for the Information Service. But at times I did begin to feel a
                    little like a third wheel in that environment, even though I spoke Vietnamese
                    and, indeed, was the only civilian Vietnamese speaker in the province - and got
                    along very well with the Vietnamese - but I was still the outsider.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, sometimes these jobs, the Vietnamese experience talking to other people
                    is that often they'd say Uh-huh, but use you as a source equivalent to a supply
                    officer.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: There was an element of that and was able to help, I think, in some
                    way to support the Vietnamese Information Service chief, an educated,
                    soft-spoken, pleasant gentleman. We got along well together and he was most
                    gracious in his hospitality to my wife when she visited over the Christmas/New
                    Years period in 1970. But I always had this sense that he had been fighting this
                    propaganda war for 20 years, and who am I, a relatively young Foreign Service
                    officer coming to tell him how to do it?</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a difference between the... Did you run across a difference between
                    the Cao Dai and the government of South Vietnam's approach to information they
                    were putting out?</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, at that time, as I mentioned, there was relative harmony between
                    the Cao Dai and the government of Vietnam. They shared parallel interests in
                    resisting the communists, their common enemy, and they enjoyed considerable
                    autonomy from Saigon in terms of running the provincial administration. It was
                    in essence a Cao Dai government, although few would openly say it, but from the
                    province chief on down, they were all Cao Dai. It's interesting, even the
                    regional military force of Tay Ninh, of course a separate military unit, not in
                    the ARVN (Arm�e de la R�publique du Vi�t-Nam (Army of the Republic of Vietnam -
                    i.e., South Vietnamese Army), had uniforms that carried the Cao Dai colors.</p>
                <p>The Cao Dai historically have been inconsistent in their loyalties. At one time
                    they had been very anti-government, and back in the '50s were one of the sects
                    actively and even violently opposed to President Diem. Later on, in the '60s,
                    they began to adapt and work with the government in Saigon, which had enough
                    problems with the Viet Cong and did not want to face the Cao Dai as well.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself in any problem with your Saigon JUSPAO, I guess it was,
                    headquarters, in that here you were dealing in a province where the game was
                    somewhat different. I mean, this was not straight GVN, Government of Vietnam,
                    work. I mean you were working more with a church. Did you have trouble sort of
                    getting that across?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, I didn't. The people from Saigon were very interested in the Cao
                    Dai. We'd get periodic visits from the Saigon warriors, as they were called, and
                    they always wanted to visit the Cao Dai temple, which was, and remains today, in
                    fact, one of the great tourist Meccas of Vietnam. The Cao Dai temple is an
                    elaborate structure, which looks like something that Disney might have created
                    with its bewildering display of dragons. The camera-toting tourists from Saigon
                    loved it. A large part of my job as my tour evolved really shifted more and more
                    away from the JUSPAO information activities into a mostly political reporting
                    function. My province senior advisor for most of the tour was a senior career
                    FSO, Parker Wyman, and he did not speak Vietnamese. He relied on me to maintain
                    contact with Cao Dai political activists and to develop reporting to the embassy
                    in Saigon. So a great deal of my assignment in Tay Ninh turned out to be
                    essentially a political reporting role, which I found both interesting and
                    challenging, particularly because the so-called propaganda advisory role, I
                    believed, had its limits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any Catholic or Buddhist influence, and how did
                        the CaDai interact with these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: There was a very small population of Catholic and Buddhist residents
                    in Tay Ninh. They usually were confined to one or two villages which had their
                    own form of autonomy within this largely autonomous province. They were pretty
                    much ignored by the Cao Dai, a relationship of mutual tolerance and indifference
                    for those most part.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Q: What about the other side. I mean how effective was this Cao Dai government? I
                    mean you had War Zone Z in the middle of the jungle and all this. I mean, what
                    was the other side doing?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, in the spring of 1970 shortly after I arrived in Tay Ninh, we
                    had what was euphemistically called the Cambodian “incursion,” the major
                    military operation by South Vietnamese and American forces moving into the
                    so-called base areas in Cambodia. Tay Ninh was the principal launching pad for
                    that operation. It was fascinating to witness this huge avalanche of American
                    tanks and other vehicles as they went across Tay Ninh into Cambodia, at the time
                    the largest military operation since the Korean War. I did, in fact, briefly
                    accompany some U.S. Army public affairs people just across the border into
                    Cambodia, but most of the time I was there watching this enormous military
                    operation and helping with the flood of hapless Cambodian refugees created by
                    the offensive.</p>
                <p>Although failing in its objective to find the Viet Cong headquarters, the
                    Cambodian operation, however, did have success in pushing back the communists,
                    dispersing them, undermining their capability to penetrate the populated areas
                    in Tay Ninh, where they had actually been able to operate in preceding years. As
                    a result of this Cambodian invasion, most of my tour was a period of relative
                    peace and security in Tay Ninh. The communists were for the most part
                    disorganized, weakened, in many cases simply absent. I could by myself, during
                    daytime hours, travel unescorted virtually anywhere in the populated part of Tay
                    Ninh. At night I wouldn't do it, but in the daytime it was not a problem. War
                    Zone C, the uninhabited area in the northern part of the province, was still out
                    of bounds. But I was fortunate to have the opportunity to travel freely and get
                    to know people in rural villages and hamlets where Americans would not have gone
                    without military escort two or three years earlier.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the American military there? I imagine you would find
                    yourself more or less in a role between the military, speaking Vietnamese and
                    all, and maybe keeping relations and things in better form than they might be.
                    Did you find yourself in that?</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I had contact both with the military advisory team with which I
                    worked on a day-to-day basis, but also with the regular military units that were
                    still in Tay Ninh when I arrived, the First Cavalry and 25th Divisions, but they
                    left the province during my tour. I think, in general, that the advisory people
                    who worked closely with the Vietnamese were much more sensitive, more aware of
                    the fact that this was not just a World War II-type conflict, but in fact a
                    complicated political war. The regular combat units, I believe, were afflicted
                    more with the fixation that this was another conventional World War II operation
                    and we would just overwhelm the enemy with our technology and power. This was,
                    in my judgment, the great mistake of Vietnam; we were just re-fighting the last
                    war, trying to do what we did in Europe and in Korea, and never really
                    understood that this was a very different environment and a very [different]
                    type of war. In many ways, the tragedy was compounded by turning the South
                    Vietnamese army itself into an American-style, World War II-type organization,
                    heavily dependent on logistics and supporting firepower- all of which made both
                    ourselves and the South Vietnamese less capable of dealing with the principally
                    political challenge that we faced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major developments, incidents, or something
                        durinthe period you were there until you left in '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, the major event, of course, was the Cambodian invasion that
                    not only resulted in, at least, the temporary easing of the security threat, a
                    brief respite that we enjoyed, but also generated an enormous flow of refugees
                    from Cambodia into the province that we had to deal with as well. While I was
                    there, the process of Vietnamization was the main reality in a war-torn part of
                    Vietnam, where Americans had been fighting in great numbers for five years, and
                    suddenly they were gone. But remarkably for a time, at least, there was no
                    sudden decline in the security, mainly because the Cambodian invasion had
                    severely damaged the Vietnamese communist infrastructure and their support from
                    across the border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Cambodians treated by the Cao Dai and-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Generally, the Cambodians were not viewed with great respect or
                    dignity by the Vietnamese, in fact, looked down upon by the Vietnamese, whether
                    Cao Dai or others. Particularly when dealing with the refugees, it was not the
                    Vietnamese government but the American government that really was most committed
                    to helping these people. The Vietnamese authorities were at best indifferent. A
                    vast cultural and social chasm separated the Vietnamese and the Cambodians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there Montagnards in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, there were no major minorities at all because iwas so heavily
                    Cao Dai in the province.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of going back to Saigon and seeing the folks at the
                    top and all that?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It was in many ways a surrealistic experience to visit Saigon, as I
                    did occasionally, because there the American military and civilian presence
                    remained pervasive despite the rapidly dropping levels of U.S. combat troops.
                    Vietnamization certainly didn't take hold there. And, frankly, I was somewhat
                    troubled to see the Americans, many had been there for years, living in the lap
                    of luxury as a result of this war. Saigon was always (and remains today) a
                    dynamic, entrepreneurial city. I left Vietnam with enormous respect for the
                    Vietnamese as a people. They are intelligent, industrious people. They make the
                    best of what they can. But at that time they were simply taking advantage of the
                    fact that you had a lot of Americans throwing around a lot of money. The problem
                    was that in the process they lost track of their own fate and their own destiny.
                    I remember specifically several times Vietnamese telling me in unguarded moments
                    over a few beers at night, that they really believed it was our war, the
                    American war, and they were just sort of bystanders or minor players in these
                    events. I think that problem persisted right up to April of 1975, the belief
                    among the Vietnamese that the Americans never really would walk away from their
                    war. It was certainly true in 1970 and probably the same in those last days in
                    1975.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, getting this experience under your belt, whither - 1971, what were you
                    thinking about, what did you want to do, and what did you do?</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I didn=t have any real strong preference or expectation about
                    any particular assignment or job. My tour in Vietnam was shortened abruptly by a
                    few months. I was back in Chicago visiting my wife and expecting to go back to
                    Vietnam for my last months. Literally on the day before I was to get on the
                    plane in Chicago, I received a call from Washington telling me that as part of
                    the draw-down in the American presence in Vietnam, my position was eliminated
                    and I was not to return. Maybe they were just trying to save travel funds since
                    I already was back in the States. As a result, my colleagues had to pack me up
                    there and return my belongings, and I went back to Washington. In a sense, it
                    was a somewhat anticlimactic way to end a tour and particularly disappointing
                    not to say goodbye to my Vietnamese colleagues and friends. I knew a large
                    number of people in Tay Ninh and was disappointed it would happen that way, buI
                    had a new son and my wife, and it was good to be reunited with them. But it
                    still was not a good way to come to closure with such an experience. Maybe it
                    finally did come to closure just last year when my son, who had been born while
                    I was in Vietnam, went to Vietnam himself as part of a graduate business school
                    project and spent three weeks in Vietnam, mostly in Saigon and Hanoi. He took
                    one day to visit Tay Ninh because he knew I had been there. He saw the Cao Dai
                    temple and the city of Tay Ninh, tried to look for some landmarks I had told him
                    about - never found them - but, I guess everything comes full circle and I=m
                    glad that he could help to bring some closure for me. I=d like to visit Tay Ninh
                    myself someday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, what was in store for you? They shortened your
                        tour,and you were in Chicago with a wife and new son. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Then I returned to Washington in the fall of 1971. I was assigned to
                    the European Office of USIA as the Yugoslav Desk officer, building upon my
                    experience before Vietnam, and also had responsibility for Bulgaria and Albania,
                    but our activities in those countries were not significant. I mostly worked on
                    Yugoslavia, one of USIA=s largest programs in the world.</p>

                <p>PENDERGRAST: 1971 and 19'72. I spent only one year in that position, although it
                    was a productive period, because I worked closely with the then USIS PAO in
                    Belgrade, Pic Littell, in actively expanding the regional reach of our USIA
                    programs and operations in Yugoslavia. At that time, of course, we, like the
                    State Department, had posts only in Belgrade and Zagreb. Based on my personal
                    experience in Yugoslavia, I believed that we really needed to move toward a more
                    decentralized operation because of the increasing role the republics were going
                    to play in the country. There was some resistance in the Department and
                    elsewhere in the government, not an easy thing for someone relatively junior to
                    deal with, but I worked different parts of the government and found some allies,
                    with strong leadership from both USIA management and Pic Littell in Belgrade, we
                    were able to establish new USIS - not State Department; just USIS at that point
                    - operations in Sarajevo, Ljubljana, and Skopje. Later on we added one in
                    Titograd as well. It was the first time that the U.S. government had reached out
                    officially to the three republics oSlovenia, Bosnia, and Macedonia. We were well
                    ahead of the entire U.S. government on this issue. Curiously, the first director
                    of the USIS program in Sarajevo, whom I helped to recruit and select, was a
                    bright, young USIA officer, Vic Jackovich, who later would become the first U.S.
                    ambassador to Bosnia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did these new posts - let's take Skopje, for example -
                        mean, how was it set up and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: They were small, modest information and library centers for a
                    variety of cultural, educational, and media programs. There was no consular or
                    other official function at all. This was actually part of the problem that we
                    had to address in terms of negotiating, not just with the Yugoslavs, but also
                    within the U.S. government because they were not going to be diplomatic posts
                    and the people there would not have formal diplomatic status. In a communist
                    country, this caused some security-conscious people a great deal of concern,
                    assigning people without diplomatic protection to these remote republics in
                    Yugoslavia. Trying to work out the modalities of official Americans in
                    non-official positions was not very easy. Ultimately, we found a way of doing it
                    where they had both diplomatic passports and regular passports and they were
                    able to play use both passports depending on the occasion. It worked out, but it
                    was not an easy thing to accomplish. But I'm glad we did it, because it was
                    important for the United States to have this presence as Yugoslavia moved down
                    the road toward decentralization and eventual unraveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that Slovenia, Ljubljana, you'd get
                        much more of a response than you would in Skopje in those days, or maybe I'm
                        wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, because in many ways the Macedonians were thrilled that the U.S.
                    government was giving them this recognition and unlike, Slovenia, which had
                    proximity to the West, especially Austria and Italy, Macedonia was a very
                    isolated republic and welcomed this new point of contact with the outside world.
                    They were delighted to have a Macedonian-speaking USIA officer there. I think we
                    really did accomplish a good deal by establishing these republic centers, a very
                    rewarding part of my one year there in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously we're speaking from 1999, when we've just gone through a military
                    exercise in Kosovo. Were we thinking, when we were in Macedonia, which has a
                    fairly large I guess we'd call it today an Albanian population - were we
                    thinking about them at the time?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I don=t think at that time the Albanian minority in Macedonia was
                    something on our radar screen. The Albanians there were not that numerous in
                    those days. That, of course, was not the case in Kosovo, where you had had
                    violent demonstrations by Albanians back in 1968.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting any reflections from Zagreb, because as I recall was it '71
                    where Croatian nationalism sort of spilled out and flags were flown at a concert
                    and there were some demonstrations and Tito went bonkers?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, there was a major Yugoslav crackdown on Croatian nationalism in
                    the early 1970s. It may have been a principal reason thaTito moved toward his
                    own political decentralization in Yugoslavia during the 1970s, a significant
                    power devolution to the republics. No doubt about it, in my view, he clearly
                    feared nationalism, which three decades of Yugoslavia had not eroded. Wherever
                    nationalism surfaced, whether in Kosovo or Croatia or even in Serbia, he
                    responded vigorously, but I think that he was trying to have it both ways
                    through repression and concession, and that's one reason he did move to
                    decentralization.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were on the Desk, were we playing close attention in trying to do
                    what we could to keep the Brotherhood and Unity theme going as far as Yugoslavia
                    was concerned?</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I don=t think that there was really that much that the United States
                    could do to strengthen unity in Yugoslavia. Our official policy of course
                    remained one of support for a united Yugoslavia, a strategic buffer between the
                    West and the Soviet Bloc. We welcomed an independent Yugoslavia and associated
                    unity with independence. But I think that defensible strategic policy was based
                    on wishful thinking more than reality. The superficial unity of Yugoslavia was
                    fragile, particularly after the Stalinist threat in the 1940s and 1950s
                    dissipated. The national divisions in Yugoslavia do not necessarily go back four
                    or five hundred years, as some would argue but to the period of Ottoman rule in
                    the 19th century and its gradual decline, which allowed different South Slav
                    nationalities to follow different paths. Before World War II, the country was
                    held together by the power of the Serbian monarchy, and then after World War II
                    by the power of a communist dictator. But by the late 1960s, you could clearly
                    sense that Yugoslavia as an authentic national unity was not taking hold. It was
                    not something that was going to endure.</p>
                <p>Q: Of course, too, we have to remember the time. You had the Soviet Union sitting
                    there, and I always felt that our real policy was not particularly Yugoslavia,
                    but if Yugoslavia got soft and started to split, it meant the Soviets would get
                    involved - as, hell, they have just in the past couple of weeks in Kosovo. And
                    so that was sort of a pressure that was keeping things together, and that's how
                    we were viewing it.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I think that's certainly a large part of it, particularly a sense
                    that the Serbs, with their more pronounced Slavophile tendencies, would be more
                    receptive to the Russians. It was certainly less true in other parts of
                    Yugoslavia, especially Croatia and Slovenia, much more Western, Catholic, and a
                    balancing force inside the Yugoslav federation. But the nationalist centrifugal
                    forces were very strong in the late '60s and early '70s, and particularly with
                    the end of the Cold War, the strategic impulse for a united, nonaligned
                    Yugoslavia completely disappeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, in '72 you finished this year on the Desk.
                        What then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, my Foreign Service career, in its peripatetic style, involved
                    then a year up at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, for what they called
                    at that time, Mid-Career Training. It basically was a year of study at the
                    Fletcher school, primarily in Soviet area studies, which suddenly had become my
                    specialty, I guess, and I profited from some very engaging professors there and
                    the entirely stimulating intellectual environment there, especially the young
                    people who had gone through the '60s and early '70s, people that I had not the
                    opportunity to know well because of my overseas assignments. I think that I
                    understood them and I understood where our own country was going a lot better
                    after that year.</p>
                <p>Q: Talking about this relationship with these students - these are creatures of
                    the Vietnam... I mean, we still were involved in Vietnam, but it was the
                    endgame.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, it was, because when I was there, there was the Christmas
                    bombing of Hanoi and then the peace agreement in '73, the formal end of
                    America=s involvement in the war.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the attitude of the people you were working with,
                    particularly the students and also the faculty, toward somebody who'd both
                    served in a communist country and in Vietnam?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I sensed there was authentic curiosity and respect for what I had
                    done. I didn't detect any hostility at all. I think the Fletcher School tended
                    to be a fairly conservative institution academically and politically. I was
                    comfortable there and enjoyed the contacts I had both with the faculty and the
                    students.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the attitude that you were getting? I'm not going to say attitude,
                    but as you were pursuing your studies, were you working on the Soviet Union
                    itself?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: That was the assignment that I had, or what I had proposed to do, to
                    work on Soviet anEast European studies, and I had a number of courses and
                    seminars dealing with that, but I also did other work in the national security
                    area as well as diplomatic history. I did not - because I'd already had a
                    master's degree - I really didn=t feel strongly committed to a master's program,
                    which would have put me into a fixed curriculum. So I was able to pick and
                    choose, and I enjoyed the experience there. I think the experience helped a
                    great deal in organizing and developing my ideas about Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>Q: It was to be 15 years later, a little more than that, that the Soviet Union
                    and the Eastern Bloc were to fall apart. From what you were sampling in the
                    academic cafeteria, were you picking up any hints about the greater Soviet
                    system and its weaknesses and problems?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I don=t think there was at that time in academe or government any
                    strong sense about the weakness of the Soviet system or the Soviet Union. This
                    was, of course, when we were moving into the era of superpower d�tente, working
                    actively to develop a strategic relationship with the Soviet Union to forestall
                    nuclear war. The idea that the Soviet Union was this great superpower essential
                    to the peace of the world seemed to be the dominant mood, not only at Fletcher
                    but I think elsewhere in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon were at
                        theipeak.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: That's right, and that was a period when there was this sense that
                    the Soviet Union was the indispensable superpower partner we had to work with. I
                    think that my instinct for Eastern Europe and the flaws in the Soviet system
                    would only come later, in my next assignment, where did begin to think about the
                    nature and underlying weakness of communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you come to your next assignment. What was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I was assigned after my year at Fletcher to Polish language training
                    in Washington and moved back again to the nation's capital, by then close to
                    having our second son, who arrived literally within a few weeks after returning
                    to Washington for language training. It was a heavy burden on Tula, my wife,
                    moving twice in less than a year and then coping with a new baby. I was fully
                    occupied, of course, during 10 months at FSI in Polish language training, but
                    the Polish came to me pretty easily given my experience with Serbo-Croatian from
                    Yugoslavia and with Russian in my school years. Each Slavic language has
                    distinctive features, but they share a lot of common structure and similar
                    vocabulary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from your language teachers about
                        Polanand from your reading? What were you expecting out of Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The instructors were undeniably from the old Poland, the
                    anti-communist Poland, with predictably no sympathy for the communist
                    government. But as I talked and read about Poland, it became quickly evident
                    that the country was superficially communist with a rich, resilient national
                    character that defied the relatively short-lived communist state. Poland was a
                    long way from the usual stereotype of a faceless communist bureaucracy or
                    authoritarian state, a conclusion reinforced in my contacts with the many Poles
                    I met during language training. Curiously, I had not had much contact previously
                    with Polish-Americans, although they have a large presence in Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the second largest Polish city in the world, after
                        Warsaw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: After Warsaw, yes. I think it remains true today, although many
                    Poles in Chicago have moved to the suburbs. My family moved to Poland in the
                    summer of 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I was in Poland from the summer of '74 to the summer o'77, three
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I was assigned to Warsaw as the USIA information officer. Press
                    attach� was the working title we used. Poland was, as I think back over 30-some
                    years, probably the most rewarding and engaging Foreign Service tour that I had
                    in my whole career. I think partly because I became increasingly aware, as I
                    hinted moments ago, that we were indeed on the cusp of history, that we were
                    beginning to see the slow but detectable unraveling of communism. And of course
                    if anywhere in Eastern Europe, it would take place in Poland, the largest, the
                    most resistant, country of the whole Soviet Bloc. While there we witnessed the
                    beginning vibrations of the disintegration of communism that would take another
                    15 years, but it was clear it was going to happen - at least to me, and I think
                    to others as well in the embassy. In 1975 there were violent outbreaks in the
                    Warsaw area against an increase in food prices. And remarkably, the communist
                    government backed down and withdrew the food price increases, which only
                    deepened the spirit of resistance and sense of empowerment among the Polish
                    people. But most significant at that time - and this is really where the process
                    of communism=s demise began - was that you had for the first time the
                    collaboration of workers and intellectuals, two forces in Polish society which
                    historically had been usually separate but for the first time united in what was
                    called the “movement for the defense of the workers.” That movement evolved
                    ultimately into Solidarity later in the 1970s. Walesa wasn't part of it at that
                    time, but some of the figures that knew, like Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik, were
                    people who eventually became major figures in Solidarity and ultimately in the
                    post-communist r�gime that came to power in 1989. But all of that really started
                    back in the mid-1970s. That was the real watershed in modern Polish history and,
                    indeed, for the rest of Eastern Europe, too.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived in '74, what were you getting from your ambassador - who was
                    he? - and from the embassy about whither things were going, and then-</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, to be very honest, I think that something that troubled me a
                    little bit about the embassy, something that somewhat divided the embassy, the
                    tendency toward a clientitis-type relationship with the communist regime, the
                    government of Edward Gierek, who came to power perceived as a “reform” communist
                    who would move Poland and Poland's economy towards the West, which the U.S. and
                    the embassy wanted to support. My impression is, however, that others in the
                    embassy were more inclined to support and identify with the dissident and
                    anti-communist forces beginning to gather force in the country, which in many
                    ways threatened the Gierek regime and jeopardized their economic opening to the
                    West. This is something that often has unsettled me about the systemic
                    differences between public and traditional diplomacy. The public diplomacy we
                    usually practiced at USIA has always focused on the long term, on what lies down
                    the road, the ultimate outcome we're trying to accomplish and encourage. Too
                    often, in my judgment, traditional diplomacy is fixated on the immediate needs
                    and health of the relationship with the ruling regime. The management of that
                    relationship becomes paramount and sometimes, perhaps not always, overshadows
                    long-term goals and values. That, very frankly, is something that concerns me a
                    great deal about USIA's integration into the State Department. I fear that the
                    dominant priorities and impulses of traditional diplomacy - the management of
                    today's relationship with a particular government - will usually prevail at the
                    expense of what we as a nation and a society really should be promoting. My
                    State colleagues may view such sentiment as overly idealistic or unrealistic,
                    but I sincerely think that clientitis is the most serious, endemic problem I=ve
                    seen over the years in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there concern at the time, at the embassy, that if the Poles go too far...
                    I mean, Poland, more than anything else, was sitting astride the Soviet main
                    supply lines, where its troops were in East Germany, and if the fighting was
                    going on, the Poles had to be quiet as far as the Soviet military was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I think you're absolutely right. There was certainly this sense both
                    in the embassy and in Washington about the emotional, adventurous Poles pushing
                    too far, about disrupting the equilibrium too much, that would arouse the
                    Soviets. For an example, a constant irritant between the embassy and the Radio
                    Free Europe in Munich was perceived bombastic language emanating from the Polish
                    service of Radio Free Europe. It was never quite put so bluntly, but that was
                    exactly what divided the exiles in Munich and the diplomats in Warsaw. I found
                    myself personally in the middle, not necessarily adhering to either side. There
                    probably was clientitis on one side and extremism on the other, which both made
                    me uncomfortable. But the bottom line was that we saw the early impulses of
                    communism=s fatal decline in the mid-'70s. And, it was, I thought, a perfect
                    example of public diplomacy=s success, the triumph of the long-term cultural and
                    educational and information approach that was having, over a period of time in a
                    steady, deliberate way - a profound impact on these societies. And a lot of it
                    was just personal contact by the embassy=s Polish-speaking officers, who
                    circulated freely and actively in cultural and intellectual circles.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I remember getting to know at that time a very unassuming, modest, soft-spoken
                    gentleman who was editor of an obscure Catholic journal that was on the edge of
                    dissidence. I never imagined at the time that my acquaintance would become the
                    first non-communist prime minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. It was just
                    amazing. But he was the type of people that we did get to know and tried to work
                    with. I think our main accomplishment, however, was just simply conveying to
                    such people America=s interest and sympathy through our regular contacts with
                    them. They were not alone or ignored. We tried to get Mazowiecki an
                    International Visitors grant to visit the United States, but he could not a
                    passport despite our intervention. But we did get a lot of people out on such
                    exchange programs, and I think we worked the edges of the society quite
                    effectively without belligerence or arousing the Polish government too much in
                    getting the American message to the Polish people - although it was admittedly a
                    very receptive audience. I=ve always thought that in my experience, Poland was
                    easily the most the most pro-American country in the world-</p>
                <p>Q: I interviewed somebody - I think he was your predecessor - who said he thought
                    there probably were about three dedicated communists in Poland when he was
                    there.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: That probably is stretching a little bit. Actually, I'm not even
                    sure about those three. But still there was certainly the so-called communist
                    elite of Poland whose exclusive motive was power, their privileges, just keeping
                    control. And, sometimes these elites misrepresented themselves to us. I remember
                    a wonderful example, a Polish journalist I got to know very well, who was quite
                    open in professing anti-r�gime views, trying to make himself a sort of
                    dissident, although he seemed to enjoy a fairly comfortable life in the
                    communist elite. Then, in 1980 immediately after the martial law r�gime took
                    power, I turned on my television set in the States, and there was my former
                    friend of mine, Wieslaw Gornicki, who turned out in a military uniform and was
                    the spokesman for the military r�gime. He was obviously someone who made his
                    choice and sided against the democratic forces in Poland, but it amused me
                    remembering his rhetoric from the time when I was there. A fascinating, often
                    unpredictable country and people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the Polish press? I mean, as
                        informatioofficer, this is one of your main targets, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Obviously, the Polish press was controlled by the Communist Party,
                    either directly or indirectly. I think one of the things that we tried to do was
                    to identify and work with those journalists who had a certain degree of
                    independence, who were able to express views that slightly bent the party line,
                    a nuance away from the official position. We couldn=t do anything in a covert
                    way that would endanger them, but we developed good relations with them, for
                    example, the highly respected weekly Polityka, which was an “official”
                    publication, but featured a number of journalists who were independent,
                    thoughtful and did some interesting, even provocative things, even in the
                    columns of a Communist Party newspaper. There was also a truly independent
                    publication, which was based in Krakow, Tygodnik Powszechny, a Catholic
                    newspaper edited by the irrepressiblJerzy Turowicz, its long-time editor and a
                    persistent sore in the side of the r�gime. But he was an extraordinary,
                    courageous man, one of the most fascinating I knew while in Poland. He really
                    exemplified the courage, integrity, and spirit of Poland, I think. His
                    publication was constantly pushing the edges of legitimacy and official
                    acceptance with predictable conflicts with government censors.</p>
                <p>So although not an open press where we could place articles, like we would in
                    many countries of the world, the Polish media allowed us to work the margins,
                    and I think with some effectiveness, because there were some enormously
                    intelligent journalists who perhaps had a Party card but they were not
                    communists but were intellectuals and professionals who did their best in that
                    type of political environment.</p>
                <p>Q: What about dealing with sort of the government spokespeople? Were these pretty
                    much apparatchiks, or were they sort of going through the motions or were they
                    true believers, or how did you find that?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Most of them did, on the surface at least, echo the Party line and
                    rarely deviated in official contacts. But when you got to know them better and
                    got them away from their offices, it usually began to break down. I remember
                    particularly one night being entertained by a group of people, most of whom
                    worked for various government institutions in Poland, and as the evening wore on
                    and the vodka flowed and the spirits relaxed, suddenly everybody was in a circle
                    and, fueled by the lubricants of the night, started to sing. And what were they
                    singing? Not Polish folk melodies. They were singing old czarist songs - the
                    songs of old pre-revolutionary Russia, which I was told later, was a deliberate
                    act of rebellion against the Soviets. But generally in Polish society, there was
                    mostly what we called “radish communists,” red on the outside and white
                    underneath. No one, I think, really took ideology very seriously.</p>
                <p>Q: How about were you able, if nothing else but for your own amusement, to twit
                    your official contacts about their wonderful relationship they had with their
                    Soviet brothers and all that?</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Oh, this was always something clearly in the background of your
                    conversations and the bantering. What does the Big Brother think of this? That
                    was a common refrain with raised eyebrows and looks of disdain. But you had to
                    careful and discreet in touching that subject because even the Polish communists
                    were sensitive about it. They did not like to think that they really were simply
                    an extension of the Soviet government. I remember in 1976, during the U.S.
                    presidential election, and there was the famous gaffe by- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>-Gerald Ford in his campaign debate with Jimmy Carter. Ford made the somewhat
                    astounding claim, perhaps just a collapse of syntax, that the Polish people are
                    not dominated by the Soviet Union, and it was played internationally as a great
                    disaster in his campaign. What was curious, I found, is that most Poles seemed
                    to get it much differently, that they - at least most of the people I spoke with
                    - saw that statement as a recognition by President Ford that the Polish people
                    were not spiritually or culturally dominated by the Soviets, that they retained
                    their sense of dignity and identity despite Soviet rule. And so the reaction in
                    Poland, I believe, was much less scandalized or shocked than you found in the
                    United States or elsewhere in the world. But as Isaw repeatedly during my three
                    years in Poland, these were people who over the centuries were so tough and
                    courageous and resilient. They had been basically a parade ground for invaders
                    for many years and somehow always survived. The Polish national anthem, “Poland
                    still survives,” says it all, really, about the Polish people.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought, although you weren't on the cultural side, obviously
                    you'd be involved, that in a way the culture was almost pre-sold, wasn=t it as
                    American culture?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, it was. I worked on the cultural side as well, because there
                    was always an information or media element in what we did with the major
                    cultural events there during that time. One was quite extraordinary in its
                    daring content: a U.S. Bicentennial exhibition in 1976, a major museum-size
                    exhibition called the world of Franklin and Jefferson. In that exhibit we were
                    able, remarkably, to incorporate the words and the wisdom and the beliefs of
                    Franklin and Jefferson, in writing, and it was amazing the Polish government
                    allowed it to happen. I think partly it was that they were so proud and honored
                    to be participants in an official American Bicentennial celebration and trying
                    to censor anything like that would have jeopardized their international
                    reputation. But the exhibit with its unambiguous affirmation of democracy and
                    freedom had a great deal of impact with Polish audiences. Anything American, of
                    course, had a great deal of appeal in Poland. But in their economic situation,
                    they couldn't afford American culture, particularly major symphony orchestras or
                    other top-quality events of that kind, so we did fill a vacuum. There was,
                    however, an insatiable interest and curiosity about American culture, in fact
                    everything American. In part, I suspect, such interest was another form of
                    indirect challenge or resistance to the communist regime.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Oh, yes, it was certainly part of it, because the Polish-Americans
                    were very active in their educational and cultural outreach to Poland. There was
                    a great deal of movement back and forth. The fact that virtually every Pole had
                    a cousin in Buffalo or Chicago was another powerful link between the two
                    countries, which I think created a real dilemma for the communist rulers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, actually we arrived a month or so before Nixon=s resignation. I
                    think it baffled most Poles, like it did people in many parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I think that no one really could figure out what was happening, what
                    these Americans were doing to each other. They could not understand how the most
                    powerful chief of state in the world could suddenly be deposed so easily, in
                    fact would himself decide to resign. Among some Poles - and especially those in
                    one way or another connected with the r�gime - the uproar over Watergate was
                    seen as part of an anti-d�tente conspiracy by people within the United States
                    who wanted to revive the Cold War and reverse the direction that Nixon and
                    Kissinger were taking in their relationships with the Soviet Union and the
                    Soviet Bloc. This is a theory we did hear fairly commonly during that time,
                    including in the media. But that was the only reaction. I think for the most
                    part the Poles were, like the rest of the world, more confused and stunned by it
                    than anything else.</p>
                <p>Q: Now a theme that I'm going to start hitting more as I do these interviews, I
                    think, now because it seems to be more prevalent, and that is these, as you were
                    mentioning, conspiracy theories. Whereas I think most Americans think,
                    particularly the way we act and sort of the unplanned lurching or what happens
                    at a particular time, did you find that the Poles sort of thought that somewhere
                    deep down in the American apparatus people were plotting exactly what to do, and
                    that we were more in charge than I think most Americans feel?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Do you mean in terms of Watergate, or-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I mean just in general.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I think that generally speaking, in my experience in Eastern
                    Europe, you find a much stronger inclination there to see conspiracies working
                    behind the scenes. There's no doubt about it. It is perhaps a result of their
                    own experience dominated by a great deal of clandestine and shadowy movements
                    struggling against each other. That has been often a major element in their own
                    survival against powerful occupiers, whether the Germans, Russians, Turks, or
                    others. The open, transparent, direct style of political engagement was pretty
                    hard to understand for most Poles and other East Europeans. And of course this
                    was particularly interesting in Poland because the Poles probably knew,
                    understood, and liked Americans better than anybody else, given all of the
                    family connections - and there was a fair amount of travel back and forth, even
                    during that period - but they still didn't get it. I don=t think they fully
                    appreciated the way we are, particularly in the values and ideals that drive our
                    system and that really, in the end, caused the downfall of the Nixon
                    Administration. But this was probably also true in Western Europe, too; they
                    just couldn't understand what Nixon did would offend people or challenge the
                    system.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, well, were you getting sort of the thought of - something would happen,
                    and they'd sort of wink at your or tap their finger to their nose and say,
                    “Well, we understand,” with the assumption that the CIA was behind whatever the
                    hell it was?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Certainly among some Poles, particularly those connected with the
                    communist government, there was a strong belief that the CIA and other people
                    who had an investment in the Cold War orchestrated this anti-d�tente conspiracy.
                    I don=t think necessarily that that was the dominant perception in Poland, but
                    it certainly was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with the Catholic Church? How did you
                        finthat in your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The Catholic Church in Poland was undeniably the most powerful
                    symbol of resistance to the communist r�gime, a very bitter and difficult
                    conflict that had gone on from the 1940s onward. The Church was a place where
                    people could find a way to express opposition to communism and the Soviet Union.
                    The churches were packed with young people, older people. But it was clear that
                    the devotion was not really religious piety for most people. It was nationalism;
                    the Church was the reservoir of Polish nationhood during the period of communist
                    rule. It was, in effect, a strong political act when people went to church every
                    Sunday. The Church=s religious and social influence was much less pronounced.
                    For example, the dominant form of birth control in Poland was abortion. It was
                    very common, because other forms of birth control were simply not available or
                    too expensive. So abortion was the customary way of controlling birth in Poland,
                    a Catholic country - not only a Catholic country but a Catholic country with a
                    very conservative church hierarchy. But everybody still went to church every
                    Sunday, indeed, on any given Sunday, not just holidays, you could barely get
                    inside a church.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The Church exercised a powerful political force in Poland both in the &gt;70s and
                    then through the martial period and finally with the collapse of the communist
                    regime. And, that historical fact was closely linked to one single Church
                    figure, whom I was privileged to meet when he was still the bishop of Krakow,
                    Karol Wojtyla, a charismatic individual who after he became Pope was an
                    extraordinary lightning rod for nationalist feeling and pride across Poland.
                    Some argue these days that, in fact, John Paul II was the main force behind the
                    collapse of communism throughout the region and a strong case can be made for
                    that view. He was a commanding advocate of human freedom and human dignity that
                    resonated loudly in the tired, decaying communist societies.</p>
                <p>We did have a fair amount of contact with the priests in Poland. Very often we
                    would provide them with films and magazines and do what we could to help them,
                    but of course they had their own church-related sources as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about students? What was our contact working with the
                        Polisstudents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: We had a fairly well-developed Fulbright exchange program and
                    generated a number of other initiatives which involved students. We tried as
                    much as we could - and very often the Polish r�gime was not happy with this
                    focus on the students - but we would organize sometime film showings; we would
                    distribute publications; I went and lectured a number of times on non-political
                    subjects in Polish universities and high schools. The Polish students were
                    always friendly toward the United States and intensely curious about us. You
                    could see in those faces that this was a country whose future did not accept
                    communism indefinitely. It gave you real hope and inspiration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you gathering about how they felt about
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, Germany was-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean we're really talking about Germans.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Germany was, of course, a very different factor in their lives, both
                    positive and negative. The Poles had enormous respect for the Germans,
                    particularly their technology, economic power, even cultural achievements and
                    what they had accomplished over the centuries; but there was also a strong
                    antipathy toward the Germans based, of course, largely on the World War II
                    experience. So it was in essence a love-hate relationship between the Poles and
                    the Germans, with most of the emphasis on the hate. I don't think they cared for
                    them very much in a personal sense either. They respected them, but they did not
                    really like them and certainly were outraged by what the Germans did in Poland
                    in the war. One-fifth of Poland=s population died in World War II, mostly Jews,
                    but also many, many non-Jewish Poles. And the r�gime really played on the
                    anti-German theme to legitimize the close ties with the Soviets as a protection
                    against so-called German revanchism. It was not easy to be a German diplomat in
                    Poland, I have to admit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American movies? Did they get-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: They got American movies but usually months or even years after
                    release in the States, mainly for economic reasons. One of the things we used to
                    do was acquire newly released films from the Motion Picture Association of
                    America and organize special representational showings. It was always a great
                    drawing card because the American film was, as elsewhere around the world, a
                    magnetic cultural force.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there within Poland at that time a certain Poles for . . . a Polish for
                    Poland. . . . I'm thinking about France, where there's a real antipathy among
                    the intellectual class about too much American influence.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: In Poland?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Poland - was there any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, to the contrary. We could never come close to satisfying the
                    appetite for American culture. If anything, the Polish government, pleading
                    poverty, usually tried to hold back and limit American cultural imports, but
                    there was an intense curiosity and fascination with American culture, among
                    students, intellectuals, professionals, all educated groups in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Dick Davies. He was the ambassador during that time, and the DCM was
                    John Davis, who of course later on went back as chief of mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Two PAOs. One was Leonard Baldyga and then JiBradshaw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were getting... How did you work
                        with botthe ambassador, DCM, and with the PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I had basically good relationships with all of them. Frankly,
                    I thought the DCM, John Davis was much closer to the reality of the unraveling
                    communism. He was very closely connected with many of the dissidents and
                    intellectuals who were clearly moving in that direction. The ambassador, I
                    think, was more occupied with managing the relationship with the Gierek regime,
                    particularly because we were looking to expand our commercial access in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe you have to play both sides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, in some ways I guess you do. Certainly, the U.S. had a
                    responsibility to deal with both official Poland and with the rapidly building
                    anti-communist forces in the country. Our PAO, Len Baldyga, was a Polish
                    American close to the Polish-American community in the U.S. and also with a vast
                    circle of independent Poles. He was very, very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, were there any major incidents or situation
                        durinthis '74-77 period that you can think of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The most significant events, in terms of the political impact, was
                    the series of riots in 1975 against the food price increases. I got involved
                    mainly in support for the American press as they flocked to cover this news
                    event that stood in the world=s spotlight. I remember one incident when John
                    Dancy, then a European correspondent for NBC Television, came to report on the
                    riots for several days with a visa and approval from the Foreign Ministry. There
                    were no real problems during his stay. He gathered material using a locally
                    hired film crew working for him, and he had it all in his carry-on bag as he
                    went to board his plane for Frankfurt. He asked me if I would escort him to the
                    airport. I was extremely busy at that time with all that was going on with the
                    press and other things, but I agreed to do it. He just had some sort of a
                    premonition. So we went out to the Warsaw Airport and I took him to the passport
                    inspection area where we said our good-byes. He went off into the customs area,
                    which was still visible, and suddenly, it was apparent that he was having some
                    trouble, because of a burly Polish border guard questioning him and pointing at
                    his bag, in an animated, disagreeable manner. And I didn't know quite what to do
                    at that time, but I finally said, I've got to get in there. With probably a
                    greater sense of authority than I should have exercised, I waved my diplomatic
                    card in front of the passport guy and barged into the customs area - everybody
                    standing there looking at me in amazement, Well, who is this guy? The Polish
                    border guard obviously wanted to inspect the canvas bag with all of the notes
                    and the videotapes which Dancy carried. Mustering every bit of arrogance I
                    could, I took on this border guard and told him that this is a representative of
                    a major world television network here on a visa from the Foreign Ministry, and
                    if they didn't let him pass, there was going to be big problems with higher
                    authorities, the always ultimate appeal in a communist country. Well, there was
                    a long, stony silence for a while, and finally the border guard realized that
                    maybe this was more trouble than it was worth for him, so he shrugged, and Dancy
                    went off to his Lufthansa flight. He came close to losing his videotapes and not
                    being able to tell his story very effectively about what was happening in
                    Poland. So a small, modest contribution on my part.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I was going to put here at the end - I think this is a good place to
                    stop - when you left Poland in 1977, and I'll just put at the end, where did you
                    go?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I went back to Washington, and I returned to the European Office of
                    USIA, where I became the director of policy in that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we'll pick it up then, 1977.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 6th of August, 1999. Dell, you were with
                        policy aUSIA from '77 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Until 1980.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Q: Can you talk a little about the policy side of USIA at that time? What sort of
                    things would one tackle, and how did it translate into actual policy?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: My responsibility as to ensure that the USIA posts in Europe were
                    adequately informed about and acting upon policy as determined by the U.S.
                    government, by the President, and the Department of State. So a lot of my work
                    involved close coordination with other government agencies, particularly the NSC
                    and the State Department to define policy and how it would be translated for
                    USIA and how specifically USIS posts in Europe would assist in promoting and
                    supporting a particular policy. So I did a great deal of liaison with the
                    various other agencies in government as well as, of course, obviously, with the
                    USIA posts across Europe, both east and west.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of USIA at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: During that period the director was John Reinhardt, in fact the
                    first and only career Foreign Service officer who ever headed up USIA, a quite
                    interesting development that I think most people in the Agency certainly
                    welcomed. His leadership reflected, of course, the Administration of Jimmy
                    Carter; which was generally reacting against the Realpolitik and the strategic
                    priorities of in the Kissinger-Nixon era. The Carter era was focused heavily on
                    reaching beyond traditional strategic relationships to deal with the Third World
                    in particular - Latin America, Africa, and so on.</p>
                <p>John Reinhardt also reflected this basic Third World bias, but he had a strong
                    view that Europe had occupied too central a place in USIA operations and
                    resource allocations in the past. He had never served in Europe himself and did
                    not fully appreciate, I think, the importance of what USIA did in that part of
                    the world. He seemed to think that these nations were close allies with already
                    close cultural and media ties to the United States. USIA really wasn=t needed or
                    could not have the same impact that it did in the Third World. And so in that
                    time, there were some strong built-in tensions inside USIA, especially involving
                    my office, the European Office, waging essentially a bureaucratic guerilla war
                    against those, including the Director himself, who felt that too many resources
                    went into Europe. I don=t think the struggle ever was resolved one way or
                    another, although by the end of the Carter Administration, there probably was
                    better appreciation of Europe and our important relationships there.</p>
                <p>Q: In arguing, how did you, at that time, to the best you could, meet the charge
                    that after all, these people are with us, they're educated people and all, they
                    can get their own information about the United States in Europe, and isn't it
                    much better to make the Africans more aware of what we're doing, or something
                    like that?</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, one tactical approach we made, and I was one of the two
                    principal authors, was what we called the “successor generation” in Europe. This
                    was something that actually had originated with our PAO in Germany at the time,
                    but I developed a paper that had wide circulation around the government -
                    indeed, later outside the government - which spelled out the analysis that we
                    were dealing with an entirely new generation of Europeans, whose values and
                    attitudes were not shaped by World War II or by the immediate postwar
                    relationship with the United States. The appreciation for the Marshall Plan and
                    NATO had faded, and young people still in the universities as well as coming
                    into government at that time had a more detached, less sympathetic attitude
                    toward the United States, partly influenced by Vietnam War. References to Athe
                    war@ for this generation evoked images of Vietnam, mostly negative, rather than
                    of World War II. And their prejudices and attitudes reflected that mindset. And
                    so we put onto the front burner of the bureaucratic stove this successor
                    generation concept and it had a great deal of resonance within the government
                    and outside the government. We became actively deeply involved with the Atlantic
                    Council of the United States, which was very interested in the idea of the
                    successor generation, which we had formulated. There were a number of
                    conferences and a major Atlantic Council paper, which I helped to draft, was
                    distributed. I think our efforts did have an impact, inside USIA and elsewhere
                    in effectively highlighting the fact that we did have a stake in Europe, that it
                    was a new Europe, one that had changed demographically as well as in other ways,
                    and the United States - in particular USIA - had a very strong interest in
                    trying to communicate with this new generation of Europe.</p>
                <p>Q: In your studies and all, did you find - we're really talking about Western
                    Europe at this point - that there was much in the way of appreciation of the
                    history of the United States, how we worked, because I know when I sampled
                    what's happening in Europe from time to time, I find there are very few courses
                    in American history or American literature or culture per se? Most of the people
                    seem to get what they know about the United States from either seeing GI's on
                    the street or TV or Hollywood.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Exactly, and I think that was a major theme in our analysis: that
                    American popular culture and the popular media images of the Vietnam War had
                    shaped an entire generation in Europe in their attitudes toward us. One of the
                    things that we've done over the years, starting during the '70s, is to emphasize
                    American studies in European schools, both secondary and higher education. One
                    of the things that we found at that time was that American studies, so-called,
                    was really nothing more than literature. Now of course, there's nothing wrong
                    with literature, and Europeans really appreciated the Hemingways and Steinbecks,
                    but it was just a small, incomplete window to American culture and society. The
                    Europeans did not have a real understanding for the political, social, and
                    economic complexity of the United States, and it was one reason why we tried
                    hard to push American studies. I think we still have a long way to go there.
                    Based on my own experience in Europe over the years, one sees people clearly
                    mirroring cartoon-like perceptions and attitudes about the United States more
                    than any serious informed analysis - even in our closest allies, and that would
                    include Canada, where, of course, I later served as well. Americans are, in many
                    ways, ethnocentric. We like to think that the rest of the world knows us,
                    understands us and likes us, but the fact is that it's superficial at best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also, I think on the other side - I'm not sure what's
                        happening today, but when I graduated from college and really through the
                        whole system, I got a good solid dose at least of European history - I mean
                        a really solid dose of European history - and I think most educated
                        Americans did. I don't think most educated Europeans get even a moderate
                        dose of American history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, certainly we found in our work in the '70s in the European
                    office of USIA, very limited, superficial treatment of U.S. history in European
                    classrooms, and I don't think it's changed much in the decades since. It's hard
                    to explain exactly why. Part of it, I suspect, is the lack of teachers with the
                    experience. the training and the background. I think also there is a certain
                    ideological bias among teachers in the secondary and higher education
                    institutions, a left-wing perspective instinctively critical of American society
                    and preferring to stress the negative features and problems in our country. We
                    started to see this problem in the 1970s as the older generation, the World War
                    II generation, started to fade away and was replaced by this new generation, the
                    successor generation. In the last 20 years, the Atlantic Alliance has not
                    collapsed, but there is greater ambivalence and reserve among Europeans. They no
                    longer applaud or salute U.S. leadership and may be often openly critical in a
                    way that was rare in the 40s and 50s. In a way, of course, it is the inevitable
                    maturity of the U.S.-European relationship and the emergence of a new, more
                    self-confident generation of European leadership that does feel dependent
                    anymore on the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, what does one do about this generational thing - I mean, not now, but at
                    that time? You can point out the problem, but what was the - I won't say
                    solution, but maybe a remedy?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: We were at that time fighting a difficult rear-guard action against
                    a determined effort to cut back the USIA resources in Europe, whether it was
                    educational exchange, cultural programs, information programs, or most
                    significantly, USIS personnel, and that reduction did continue to take place,
                    but not as drastically as we feared at one point. Clearly, we wanted to deal
                    with the successor generation by emphasizing more programs centered on young
                    people, and this included educational exchanges as well as programs conducted at
                    American cultural centers, including the network of the Amerika H�user in
                    Germany, but we never could escape the resource pinch.</p>
                <p>Q: Again going back to leadership, I've talked to some people who during this
                    time worked with John Reinhardt, and as a person they respected him but not very
                    much as a leader. How did you feel about that?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: He was a person that we all respected as a career officer with a
                    superb record, who also served as an ambassador. On a one-to-one basis, he was a
                    very congenial, pleasant person. His problem of leadership was that he tended to
                    be distant and remote - maybe it was shyness. It was difficult for him to
                    articulate and communicate his leadership to the rest of the agency. And, as I
                    suggested earlier, he did have a certain bias against Europe and against the
                    European programs, which caused some unhappiness in our office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the European Bureau in which you were dealing include
                        thSoviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, it did. The European Office went, as we said, from Vancouver to
                    Vladivostok, most of the world=s time zones, a sprawling area that included not
                    only the Soviet Bloc but the Mediterranean countries, including Turkey and
                    Greece. So I had to stay engaged, not only with Western European issues but of
                    course I was involved at that time with the Eastern European world, which had
                    become essentially my professional specialty. Most significant then, during that
                    time, was the death of Tito in 1980. There was in Yugoslavia an immediate
                    attempt to bolster the country=s unity in the crisis and to hold things together
                    through a new collective leadership, but at that time, I still did not have
                    great hopes for Yugoslav unity, which later did unravel. I guess we were only
                    surprised that it lasted a decade, but I think it was crumbling under the
                    surface the whole time.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, of course, probably the gel was the fact that if it started to fall
                    apart, you had the Soviet Union, which would be ready to fish in troubled
                    waters. And I think we felt this, and I imagined the general Yugoslav citizen
                    felt this, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I think there was that element and when the USSR weakened and
                    collapsed, the cement of the Soviet threat disappeared. I think it was also, at
                    that time, a great deal of uncertainty about what would happen if Yugoslavia
                    came apart, and would the Serbs or the Croats take advantage of it and try to
                    annex territory elsewhere in Yugoslavia. They were all basically looking
                    nervously at each other and worried about what would happen if it fell apart.
                    For a limited time, I guess they shared a vested interest in holding it
                    together, which they managed to do, but of course it finally did fall apart in
                    the early 90s.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, as an Eastern European, dealing-with-the-communists hand and all, what
                    was our impression, what were we doing during this - this is the Carter
                    Administration - and we'll go up to December of 1979, because that's obviously a
                    real change? But up until that time, Carter had the idea that you could deal
                    with the Soviets, and he was trying to break the mold and have a different
                    approach. How did that translate into what you all were doing?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: There was a continued effort to use the persisting climate of
                    d�tente to expand exchanges and our programs in the Soviet Union and other East
                    European countries. Once again, we were caught in the general resource decline
                    that USIA experienced. We probably did not do as much as we could in the
                    circumstances. It was, of course, as you suggested, dramatically changed after
                    the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan when d�tente basically came off the tracks
                    and in the Soviet Union, we virtually closed down our operations and called off
                    our participation in the Olympics, along with other measures taken against
                    Moscow, including suspension of exchange activities. And we were back in the
                    Cold War freezer again.</p>
                <p>Q: As you looked at Eastern Europe during this, prior to the Afghan invasion, how
                    did we look upon the receptivity of what we were doing and the difference
                    between Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and those?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Our programs in Eastern Europe varied dramatically because each
                    country, historically, politically, and culturally, was very different. We could
                    do a great deal in a country like Poland or Hungary, but we were severely
                    restricted in Czechoslovakia or East Germany or Bulgaria. We were constantly
                    trying to push the envelope, to expand our activities in those countries, but it
                    was still difficult, despite the d�tente in East-West relations. I think the
                    Hungarians and the Poles had more confidence to pursue these exchanges with us.
                    There was also in both countries a much stronger democratic movement and impulse
                    that helped to open up doors for us.</p>
                <p>Q: In France, I would think, at least from the officials there, they would not
                    look with pleasure upon our trying to introduce too much about the United
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I don't think that bureaucratically or politically we encountered
                    any strong resistance to what we did in France. The French government has always
                    had an almost arrogant self-confidence about their culture and their society
                    that they feel forced to restrict official U.S. activities. They have a more
                    anxious and critical attitude toward American popular culture, which they do see
                    as a powerful, real threat. But I don't think that they worried about the
                    Fulbright Program in France or anything else that USIA administered in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, December, 1979, was
                        there perceptible shifting of gears within the European Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Absolutely, we essentially closed down our exchange program with the
                    Soviet Union, which was quite large by that time. We did not close down in other
                    parts of the Soviet Bloc, because we followed the policy of “differentiation,”
                    treating each of the communist countries on their own merits and not as a single
                    entity. We tried to keep our programs going elsewhere, although clearly the
                    Afghanistan episode had an impact everywhere. And of course, eventually in
                    Poland, and this of course happened after I left Washington, but there was the
                    crackdown on Solidarity and imposition of martial law in 1981, which totally
                    closed down our programs there.</p>
                <p>Q: The European Bureau, Europe being the source of major immigration to the
                    United States, did that translate itself - the German-Americans, the
                    Irish-Americans, the Ukrainian-Americans and what have you - did that translate
                    itself into anything you were doing, or was that-</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, I think that if you're dealing with Western Europe, the
                    traditional European nationalities, the Germans, the Irish, the Italians, the
                    Scandinavians, who came to this country mostly in the 19thcentury, if not
                    before, that they have pretty much assimilated and do not exercise on the U.S.
                    government any united or identified influence. But the East Europeans, more
                    recent immigrants to the country, remain pretty well organized and had an impact
                    on U.S. government policies, including our programs. The Polish-Americans are a
                    large, powerful political force in the United States, and of course a strongly
                    anticommunist force, which we had to take into account. Our programs had to
                    clearly demonstrate outreach to the Polish people and not to the Polish regime.
                    There was strong support for our programs among the Polish-Americans provided we
                    did not suggest any capitulation or weakness in dealing with the Warsaw
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, by 1980, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I went off first to language training in French, to take on
                    for the first time a Romance language after all the years with Vietnamese and
                    Slavic languages, and then in the summer of 1981, I went to Brussels, Belgium,
                    to become the head of the USIA office at the U.S. mission to the European
                    Community, the predecessor to the European Union, the massive bureaucracy that
                    runs the European organizations there. It was, I think, a logical step from my
                    previous job, because it kept me engaged with the new and evolving relationship
                    between the United States and its principal allies in Europe. Our experience
                    with the European Community demonstrated that the dynamic of transatlantic
                    relations had definitely changed - permanently - into a complex mix of
                    cooperation and competition and tension and affinity. We were not quite equals,
                    certainly in a military sense, but economically and politically there was a
                    greater sense of partnership than had been true before. The old
                    patron-beneficiary relationship really was dead. So it required a lot of
                    creative diplomacy for the United States and for Europe to manage the
                    relationship and work out their differences. It was not easy. It was a time, of
                    course, when the Reagan Administration had arrived in Washington reasserting
                    confidence in American power and American preeminence in the world. It was not
                    easy to deal with Europe from a Washington perspective, but it was something
                    that we had to do, and there were day-to-day problems, such as all sorts of
                    commercial disputes over steel and pasta and wine and something called corn
                    gluten that probably no one will ever want to hear much about because you feed
                    it to pigs, but the bottom line is that these were major explosive, complicated
                    issues. There was a major dispute over the famous European gas pipeline to the
                    Soviet Union, which the U.S. adamantly opposed in the post-Afghanistan period,
                    but the controversy aptly showed how the two sides of the Atlantic were indeed
                    beginning to look quite differently at the world.</p>
                <p>And all of this imposed a great deal of work on what our Mission was doing in
                    Brussels, particularly dealing with the European media in Brussels, a very
                    sophisticated, savvy press corps that knew these issues and knew everything
                    about how the United States and Europe viewed those issues. It was very hard to
                    conduct private diplomacy because, in the end, everything was public there;
                    everybody was leaking all over the place, especially in the European Community
                    bureaucracy. It was a challenge to keep up and try to deal with it. Our big
                    advantage and, indeed, the joy in working those four years in Brussels was our
                    extraordinary chief of mission, Ambassador George Vest, probably the most
                    impressive career officer I've known in my 30-plus years in the Foreign Service,
                    a person of flawless professionalism with a keen knowledge and understanding of
                    the transatlantic relationship - he had been an assistant secretary for Europe -
                    from his many years of experience in Europe. He knew Europe like the back of his
                    hand. But even more important, he was a genuine, warm, sincere human being.
                    People instantly relaxed with him and it was a real asset in dealing with the
                    sometimes difficult Eurocrats or journalists we encountered at the Mission. I
                    don=t think postwar America has had a finer Europeanist than George Vest and I
                    know that puts him above some pretty distinguished company.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Q: I had a long interview with George and have the highest regard for him, as
                    does everybody who's dealt with him. Well, in a way, I would think that the USIA
                    basically, I take it, was mainly press functions, what you were doing, because
                    you were dealing in a capital with bureaucrats who were assigned to a place, and
                    so it's not a country type thing.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, you're right, and this is in fact one of the things I tried to
                    do in my four years, to move the traditional media-oriented operation of USIA at
                    USEC Brussels into a more proactive, goal-centered institution featuring
                    exchange activities with Europe. It wasn't easy because people in Washington and
                    in the capitals around Europe - the USIA people - mumbled, “What are you doing
                    talking about a Fulbright Program with Europe? Why have exchange programs with
                    Europe when we have programs in each country?” But I think that it was important
                    to do this and affirm the fact that the United States was comfortable and
                    realistic with Europe and the emergence of unified European institutions. We
                    were indeed one of the principal architects of European unity. Through the
                    Marshall Plan and other initiatives, we had deliberately fostered the type of
                    cooperation that resulted in the Treaty of Rome and the European Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's been the cornerstone of our policy for the last 50
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: And we felt particularly - and here it gets back to the successor
                    generation - we recognized that young Europeans considered themselves European
                    as much as they did German, Italian, or French. It was important, I concluded,
                    to adapt our programs to this new European generation. And, so I initiated a
                    number of programs along these lines, including the Fulbright Program, to the
                    European Community. One specific exchange was that we launched an internship
                    exchange where European and American interns on both sides of the Atlantic would
                    exchange positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say interns, what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The European Commission had an internship program and we arranged to
                    have many of these young people spend a period of time in the States, primarily
                    visiting federal and state government offices, to get a solid, substantive
                    American exposure. A number of Americans also came over and worked an entire
                    year as interns at the European Commission. We also developed a speakers program
                    bringing over U.S. specialists of all kinds to address seminars and other forums
                    before audiences of European Community officials. There was also the College of
                    Europe, a celebrated academic institution connected with the European Community
                    and located in Bruges, Belgium. We were actively involved in a variety of
                    programs there, too. The whole purpose was, indeed, to develop a series of
                    exchange initiatives aimed at Europe and the emerging European institutions
                    rather than only through individual countries. Obviously we never had the size
                    of a program comparable to USIS in France or Germany or Italy. It was modest,
                    but I think an important step, particularly with the benefit now of having seen
                    the further evolution toward European unity.</p>
                <p>A second area emphasized during my four years was to try and see the U.S.
                    relationship with Europe as being not compartmentalized - security here and
                    economic here - that we worked on having Europeans and Americans thoughtfully
                    examine how the economics and the security dimensions interacted and were
                    dependent on each other. I did this in close collaboration with my colleagues
                    out at the U.S. mission to NATO, which was right across town but for years might
                    as well have been a continent away. There was little interaction between USIS
                    operations at the U.S. mission to the EC and the U.S. mission to NATO. But I
                    think we made some progress there. We had several major conferences which
                    brought security and economic specialists together to look at these problems in
                    a broader, more open-ended way. And, we profited at the time in having strong
                    support from George Vest and on the NATO side from Ambassador David Abshire.
                    Both had forward-looking, unbureaucratic perspectives on U.S.-Atlantic
                    relations. And, the same could be said by our PAO at USNATO, Stan Burnett, a
                    USIA colleague whom I respected a great deal. He was also actively engaged in
                    this new effort to bring together and address the security and the economic
                    dimensions in the same context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived there when, in early '81 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that one of your prime tasks to begin with would be the
                    selling of President Reagan, because President Reagan was considered. . . . I
                    mean, people had seen him as not a . . . sort of a class B movie actor, and he
                    had the reputation of being kind of a cowboy and a rather unpredictable person,
                    and I would have thought that it might not have been spelled out but this was
                    the task. They say, you know, this is a-PENDERGRAST: I don=t think we ever had
                    any instruction or guidance to “sell” Ronald Reagan. I think he did it quite
                    adequately by himself. He was a splendid communicator and his natural charm and
                    affability and sincerity did come across to the Europeans. There may have been
                    initially some skepticism about this movie actor turned President, but that bias
                    did not endure long. By 1981, the Europeans had become distressed by what they
                    viewed as a certain paralysis of American leadership, a result largely of
                    Iranian hostage crisis, the perceived erosion of American power in the world,
                    and the perception that Jimmy Carter was regarded as a lightweight in terms of
                    leadership. Ronald Reagan, whatever one may think of his policies, exuded a
                    confidence and sense of purpose that impressed Europeans as well as
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>There were a number of issues that did, of course, strain U.S.-European
                    relations, a product of the differing perspectives and priorities on the two
                    sides of the Atlantic. One, of course, the most serious perhaps in that period,
                    was the proposed European gas pipeline into the Soviet Union, which the Reagan
                    Administration saw as a violation of the embargo with the Soviet Union after
                    Afghanistan. And there was clearly tension in terms of the policy toward the
                    Soviet Union, but I don't think it was ever reduced to a personalized criticism
                    of Ronald Reagan. It was more an attitudinal divergence between Europe and the
                    United States more than a personal one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the European Parliament in Strasbourg exist at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, it did, and it was part of our portfolio. We did a limited
                    amount of exchange work with the European Parliament and the U.S. Congress. I
                    went down to Strasbourg several times a year, but there was not a great amount
                    of effort, because the European Parliament at that time had still not yet
                    developed into a very active legislative forum and was in session only for
                    relatively brief periods.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression, as the European Union was forming? It seems to me in
                    1999 that, while in the long run it's “a good thing,” it seems to be too much
                    bureaucracy and it seems to exist to put a lot of controls in the economy and
                    all that.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: There's no doubt that the European Commission, the executive arm of
                    the European Community and now the European Union, was a large, heavily
                    bureaucratized institution. A major philosophical divide between Europe and the
                    United States has been the European readiness to accept a larger government role
                    in society, whether in terms of regulation or a more proactive force in
                    employment and welfare programs. The United States, by virtue of its history and
                    its tradition, has been less comfortable with the idea of big government. And I
                    think that this is really at the heart of many differences we've had over the
                    years with Europe, and particularly the European Community. Agriculture is an
                    apt case, because they have what they call the Common Agricultural Policy -
                    enormous subsidies that maintain European farmers far in excess of even the
                    relatively modest subsidies that we give our own farmers. And this was a
                    critical issue because American farmers had to compete with these heavily
                    subsidized, largely inefficient European farmers - who work mostly small plots
                    of land rather than the large-scale farming in the States. But Europe was and
                    remains absolutely trapped by the entrenched social policy of wanting to support
                    its own agriculture at any cost. It often amazed me that European consumers
                    accepted artificially inflated food prices so readily, but that explains the
                    basic philosophical and psychological differences involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues that particularly grabbed you -
                        yomentioned the pipeline - and other ones that caused real problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The pipeline issue was undoubtedly the most dramatic which involved
                    a great deal of tension and time during that period and, as indicated, reflected
                    a basic divergence of approach to the Soviet Union. There were also a series of
                    commercial disputes that took place. One major issue was the fact that the
                    American dollar was so heavily valued and tended to distort the economic
                    relationship. It hurt U.S. exports, which only exacerbated the European-U.S.
                    trade relationship. Our trade deficits soared higher and higher, which
                    intensified the pressures in the United States against the alleged European
                    infractions in the trade area. And this came down on a day-to-day basis with
                    some real knotty problems involving the United States and the European
                    Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your method of operation? I mean how did you go
                        abouon a daily basis? What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I mentioned the various non-media activities that we tried to
                    develop with various European institutions, and that was operationally something
                    we tried to do differently than had been done before in that office. But there
                    was a steady flow of policy and commercial issues taking place on a day-to-day
                    basis, which emphasized the media relations of our work. Early in any working
                    day, we had to have close coordination with other elements of the U.S. mission,
                    including the ambassador, to identify the most pressing problem, the approach we
                    wanted to take, and then in phone calls and personal meetings or press
                    briefings, tried to get out our position to the European media, the press
                    community that specialized in European affairs. It was a difficult,
                    knowledgeable audience to deal with, a real challenge. We worked on it very
                    hard. We also coordinated closely with our USIS missions elsewhere in Europe, in
                    other countries, and tried to work with them in terms of mobilizing support for
                    the U.S. position on a particular trade issue.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get involved in the missile situations where the Soviets put in the
                    SS-20 and we were putting in Pershings and all, or was that more on a
                    country-to-country basis?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: That was primarily addressed on a country-to-country basis and, of
                    course, through NATO. It wasn=t something directly involved in the U.S.
                    relationship with the EC. But the public debate about the medium-range missiles
                    was also the background in Brussels for an eruption of a major terrorist threat
                    from extreme left-wing elements adamantly opposed to Pershing missile
                    deployment. I remember on a number of nights being abruptly awakened by large
                    explosions that shattered windows across Brussels, and they were aimed at
                    American official targets. Fortunately, it didn=t happen at our mission or any
                    of our homes. One American company, I think, was also bombed. No one was hurt
                    because the bombings took place in the middle of the night, but we were
                    naturally edge for some weeks in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they identified? I mean, were these part of the Red

                <p>PENDERGRAST: Bader-Meinhof, Red Flag - they came with various titles and
                    identities that crossed national lines, but it was clearly an extreme left-wing
                    phenomenon hostile to NATO and the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the European press that you dealt with? I mean,
                    was it professional? Was it ideological? Or all of the above?</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, my experience was dealing with the Brussels press corps - he
                    Europeans representing newspapers and media institutions from elsewhere in
                    Europe - that these people were almost universally professional, bright, not
                    really signaling any ideological bias. I was never conscious of any
                    anti-Americanism, at least in this particular media community. Now obviously in
                    the European national capitals, the media often did have an anti-American
                    bias-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: L'Humanit� and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The people that I dealt with on a day-to-day basis in Brussels - and
                    these were from essentially the mainstream press of Europe, The Financial Times,
                    Le Figaro, Frankfurter Allgemeine - these people there were first-class
                    journalists, and I enjoyed and was challenged working with them. These people
                    knew their business and the issues. One of great tasks was just being on top of
                    the technical details in these trade issues. The intricacies of a steel dispute
                    between the United States and Europe normally would not engage my interest and
                    certainly in many ways went beyond my competence, but I had to force myself to
                    deal with those issues because as the spokesperson for the mission, it was my
                    responsibility to address and respond to questions from people who knew what
                    they were talking about. But I basically felt pretty good about the journalist
                    community in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, in 1984 you moved on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: 1985. I was there four years, from '81 to '85, and then returned to
                    Washington, where I spent a delightful year in the State Department Senior
                    Seminar, a rewarding experience, mainly from the standpoint of getting
                    acquainted, almost for the first time, with my own country, because I had spent
                    so many years away from the United States or working in Washington. A major
                    priority for thSenior Seminar was travel and study related to what was going on
                    in the United States. I really profited from that opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What particularly struck you about the United States from
                        thiexperience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Based on the Seminar travel to every region of the United States, I
                    came away more enthusiastic and more confident than ever before about the
                    strength and vitality of our country. Visiting cities from Atlanta or San
                    Antonio or Seattle or Detroit - I was impressed by the quality and work of local
                    community organizations and community leaders, which I don=t think is found
                    anywhere else in the world. I really believe we underestimate the vitality and
                    energy of our local political institutions and the various community groups in
                    the local orbit. It was very encouraging, even inspiring. I think a second
                    impression, clearly evident in the mid 1980s, was that the United States was
                    moving aggressively into the new technologies, into the new information world,
                    and that our industries and communities were adapting and changing much more
                    rapidly than they were iEurope - a process that of course accelerated going into
                    the '90s. We were on the cutting edge of this third industrial revolution. So I
                    came away from the year invigorated and enthusiastic about what was ahead for
                    the United States, because we had such tremendous resources to build upon, both
                    economically and politically. I think another impression was the major impact of
                    immigration on the United States. Europe, at that time, and in later years, has
                    always seemed to resist immigration. They somehow are not comfortable with the
                    idea of different peoples and cultures coming into their society. The United
                    States generally has been more receptive, and certainly in the last 20 years,
                    starting in the '70s and moving into the '90s, we have welcomed from Asia and
                    Latin America in particular an enormous number of people who have enriched our
                    society. And, that reality was also evident in the mid-80s, a society that was
                    more dynamic, more flexible, more accommodating to both technical and social
                    change. It was the foundation for the spectacular growth we have seen in the
                    1990s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1986, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: In 1986 I was in Washington and went back into USIA to the European
                    Office, the same one where I'd worked before. This time I became the deputy
                    director of Europe, but in the division of responsibility there, I was in charge
                    of USIA operations in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. And coming into that
                    job in 1986, it was both fortuitous and fascinating because we were at that
                    moment beginning to enter the Gorbachev period of Glasnost and Perestroika,
                    which had enormous impact upon not only the Soviet Union but also upon Eastern
                    Europe. No one in 1986, specialist or not, really predicted everything that
                    would unfold just three or four years later. But I did see that this was a
                    promising opportunity for the United States and USIA. As Gorbachev clearly
                    signaled readiness for communist societies to open up, adapt and reform,
                    something we had never witnessed on such scale before in the communist world.
                    And, it gave USIA an opening to expand our access and our activities in that
                    part of the world. And so, starting in 1986, I made a concerted effort as
                    manager to get the resources and the programs that would seek to reinforce the
                    trends and possibilities for reform in the region. Perhaps, my success was
                    mixed, but I think that we - that is, USIA - were at the cutting edge in the
                    government in responding to the Gorbachev era.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I think what happened in 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of
                    communism was certainly attributable to many factors, mostly internal dynamics,
                    but I do honestly believe from experience in that part of the world for 30 years
                    or more, that what the U.S. government and particularly USIA did in terms of
                    information, educational, and cultural programs was a major factor in the
                    process of democratic change and reform. There's no doubt that the ideas, the
                    programs, the contacts - everything that we did over a long-term period - had a
                    cumulative effect in supporting the forces of change that brought down
                    communism. It is probably an underestimated, largely neglected story in the Cold
                    War, which historians might study in the future. But I feel a real sense of
                    reward and satisfaction having been involved in the whole process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '86 to '90.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: '86 to '90, and it was exactly when everything was happening,
                    sparked by the emergence of Solidarity power in Poland, and it was exciting to
                    see how the old apparatchiks of communism simply could not hold back the flood
                    of history, even in places like Bulgaria and East Germany. Their time had come
                    and gone. Of course, Gorbachev was crucial because his Glasnost and Perestroika
                    offered legitimacy to the forces of reform in Eastern Europe. I think Gorbachev
                    himself never wanted or anticipated that the USSR and its allies would unravel.
                    He really wanted to strengthen and modernize communism and make it more
                    competitive in a rapidly changing world. But he underestimated both the internal
                    decay of communism and the powerful, suppressed nationalist and democratic
                    impulses inside Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Once Gorbachev pushed the
                    stone down the hill, it gained momentum and could not be stopped.</p>
                <p>Although certainly a rewarding time in my career, it was also to some degree
                    frustrating to witness some degree of bureaucratic resistance to the pleas I was
                    making, to get the money and the programs which the opportunity required. We had
                    modest success, but not everybody was convinced. Large bureaucracies change
                    slowly, and my only regret is that we did not move quite as quickly and
                    aggressively in response to the opening which Gorbachev handed us.</p>
                <p>Curiously, I must admit, the principal support that we had for major initiatives
                    was not among the career people - either USIA or State - but in the White House,
                    in the NSC. I think President Bush and people around him very much did see the
                    opportunity and we were very responsive. I got a great deal of support from
                    Condoleeza Rice at the NSC, among others, who sensed we were on the verge of
                    something really big.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're saying support, I mean, what are we talking
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I'm talking basically about money and programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about programs. In other words, what were we
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, for example, one initiative that never would have happened if
                    left to the foreign affairs bureaucracy, was the 1000/1000 program, a new
                    initiative that announced by President Bush to exchange one thousand U.S. high
                    school students with one thousand Russians and the numbers eventually far
                    exceeded that level. Within the USIA bureaucracy there was great resistance,
                    because everyone fears that their own program or budget will have to pay for
                    something new. But the White House wanted it, perhaps with some political
                    motivation as well, but this and some other initiatives never would have
                    happened without White House support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk on that. Putting a thousand Russians or Soviets
                        intthe United States, where were they going? I mean, this is quite a
                        job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, certainly there were major administrative problems, but in the
                    United States, the infrastructure was there because international exchange is
                    well established at the community level across the country. We had the
                    educational exchange organizations with the experience to run these programs at
                    the grassroots level and a strong tradition of volunteerism, which is unique to
                    the United States. It was not an insurmountable problem. The main hurdle was
                    finding the resources within the U.S. government, which we did.</p>
                <p>There were other initiatives that we also put forward, and with, again, White
                    House support, we were able to get many done. I'd think we could have done more,
                    but we were on the whole reasonably successful. Once the Berlin Wall came down
                    and the communist dominoes started to fall, programs in Eastern Europe and the
                    former Soviet Union became the bureaucratic bandwagon everyone wanted to board.
                    It became the new flavor of the month, but it wasn=t that way back in the
                    1980s.</p>
                <p>Q: But what about our response - exchanges, but what other things? Just
                    increasing what we were doing - publications, things like this - or were we
                    finding sort of new opportunities?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: During those last years, it was to a large degree trying to
                    basically expand all of our limited programs in that part of the world in any
                    way that we could. In that period, I was heavily involved in the negotiation of
                    a number of formal exchange agreements with the communist world and we worked
                    hard to increase the numbers and widen our access to these societies in every
                    way possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about broadcasting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, broadcasting was a principal information tool dealing with the
                    Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, which of course took on added importance in the
                    last years of the Soviet empire. But we were doing many different things in the
                    exchange area as well, trying to diversify our exchange programs, not just with
                    students and professors but to involve a wide range of other professional
                    groups, the new modernizing class sensitive to the information revolution and
                    everything else happening in the Western world. And it was a challenge,
                    particularly because in places like East Germany and Rumania and Bulgaria, where
                    the governments fiercely resisted Gorbachev's initiatives and naturally were not
                    receptive to our own initiatives. Actually, we probably could do more in the
                    Soviet Union at that time than we could in East Germany or Bulgaria. But we
                    worked hard at it, and things definitely began to move. In Poland, of course, a
                    particular interest of mine, when marital law had been declared back in '81, one
                    of the first steps by the military r�gime, hardly coincidental, was a ban on all
                    operations by USIA in the country, which continued through the '80s. One of the
                    things I set out to do and eventually did accomplish was to negotiate a
                    reopening of USIA operations and programs in Poland in 1988. They agreed
                    grudgingly because the military r�gime, indeed, was still in power. But I think
                    that they yielded slowly because, first, they recognized the forces that were at
                    work in their own society which demanded greater access to the outside world,
                    and they also recognized that if they were going to have a relationship with the
                    United States government, they could not just basically tell USIA to stay out.
                    There was an implicit quid pro quo with the overall official relationship moving
                    forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Rumania fit in at this time. Ceausescu was in
                        poweuntil, well, just about the time that you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: And this was a country defiantly and consistently hostile to any
                    sort of opening. It was difficult for us to have programs in that country. But
                    it was the only country in the Soviet Bloc where we actually had a separate
                    cultural center, and a very nice one, in Bucharest, that had been the result of
                    the Nixon visit back in the late '60s. It was a showpiece but tightly controlled
                    and monitored by the Rumanians. They were tough on our programs there, and it
                    was only after the uprising and the eventual overthrow of Ceausescu that things
                    opened up for us.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you were sitting with a bunch of Soviet experts at USIA, and I guess it
                    was probably more than a matter of allocation of resources and favorite programs
                    getting lopped to do other things, but what was the attitude of many of the
                    people dealing with the Cold War Soviets for so long as Gorbachev - we're
                    talking about the crucial years - came on? Was there considerable
                    skepticism?</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I think no one back in the mid '80s predicted any of the
                    events that took place so swiftly in '89, '90 and '91. We were all surprised
                    that things fell apart so rapidly - less so, perhaps, in Eastern Europe, where
                    in some countries the Soviet hold was always fairly loose. I think those of us
                    who had served in that part of the world recognized back in the '60s and even
                    the '50s, that the region was only artificially and superficially communist,
                    that communism had never really taken hold there. It dominated only because of
                    what the Red Army did in 1945. And so I knew back in Poland in the '70s - I
                    always was confident communism someday would disappear, maybe in a very
                    evolutionary rather than in a sudden eruption, but I certainly did not see the
                    system as permanently rooted there.</p>
                <p>But most specialists were clearly taken by surprise by what happened inside the
                    Soviet Union itself. Many so-called Soviet experts in the mid-'80s were not
                    sanguine that Gorbachev was even going to be able to even survive the challenge
                    by the hard-line orthodox elements or produce anything that we saw emerge in the
                    1990s. My own view is that Gorbachev did not really want or expect the result,
                    in other words, the breakup of the Soviet Union and collapse of communist
                    institutions. Whatever he may say in retrospect now, he really wanted to save
                    the Soviet Union and communism. HiPerestroika was designed to preserve and
                    strengthen rather than to overthrow. I think what happened, of course, was that
                    people began to take the opportunity for change and reform much more seriously
                    than he ever imagined, starting in the Baltic countries and then moving
                    elsewhere to the Ukraine, Russia and other places. Across Eastern Europe as
                    well, the democratic forces clearly exploited the Gorbachev policies as an
                    opening for their own benefit, which particularly frightened the hard-line
                    regimes in the GDR and Czechoslovakia. There was a demand for reform across the
                    entire communist world that went well beyond what Gorbachev intended. But that
                    is what happened and no one that I know - even the most eminent Sovietologists
                    inside or outside government - saw it coming in the mid-'80s. We knew that
                    Gorbachev was a very different leader than before, but Nikita Khruschev had been
                    also seen as a major departure from the Stalinist era and he eventually, of
                    course, failed. And I think that there was, among the Soviet specialists, a
                    certain unease that Gorbachev might face the same fate, whether taken down by
                    the military, the Party bureaucracy, or both. Gorbachev obviously did ultimately
                    fail, but the whole system went down with him, too. So much of history is
                    unintended consequences.</p>
                <p>Q: In the events of November-December of 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall,
                    were you all sitting around figuring, Well, this is back to the drawing board,
                    and What do we do now?</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, frankly, I think the U.S. government and USIA - I mean
                    everybody really was stunned, particularly with the rapidity that the communist
                    states came apart. There was a clear sense that we have whole new ball game and
                    new opportunities and new societies to deal with. And, so just as I was leaving
                    the job, Eastern Europe was discovered and people jumped on the bandwagon. After
                    having spent three or four years walking up and down the hallway trying to get
                    people to recognize that things were brewing there, that something was indeed
                    happening, at least in Eastern Europe, trying to get the programs and the
                    resources, suddenly Eastern Europe became the bureaucratic flavor of the month.
                    I had a certain cynicism to see such a response after all that I been pushing
                    for years with mixed success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as Eastern Europe changed hands, whither you? What
                        did yodo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I was initially assigned to become the public affairs officer at The
                    Hague in the Netherlands. It wasn=t a particularly big job given the size of the
                    country, but having served in Belgium and visited the Netherlands a number of
                    times, it was a reasonably interesting and challenging environment. I also had a
                    school-age son, and the schooling situation for Americans was very good in The
                    Hague. I think my family looked forward to the assignment. I started to take
                    Dutch and was at FSI for about two months when I got a call offering me the PAO
                    position in Ottawa, Canada, the result of a broken assignment by another
                    officer. I thought about the opening for a short time, and the more and more I
                    considered it, the job intrigued me because Canada was a country I didn't know
                    much about - in fact, very little. But it was a very large operation in terms of
                    USIA programming, certainly larger than the one in the Netherlands, with branch
                    posts in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Yes, very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: And, of course, the country had the added advantage of being close
                    to the United States where we had a son in university and an elderly parent to
                    monitor. It was also in the same time zone with Washington, but I didn=t know
                    yet whether that was an asset or a disadvantage. In any case, I left Dutch
                    language training, had some French refresher, and then in the summer of 1990,
                    went off to Ottawa, Canada, and spent four years there.</p>
                <p>In many ways it was probably the most illuminating and educational experience
                    I've had in my Foreign Service career because I went there with virtually no
                    knowledge of Canada. Like most Americans, I took it for granted. It was there.
                    Canada, I thought, was a de facto extension of the United States, but as I
                    arrived and got into the job, I realized that you're dealing with a creature
                    very different from the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Q: Also, I would think, particularly in the kind of work you're dealing with, I
                    won't say it's hostile, but it's one that - particularly in the media and all -
                    there are real tensions and concerns. I mean, you're talking about a very touchy
                    group of people.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: You're absolutely right, and I say this quite honestly after
                    substantial overseas experience, but I have never witnessed a more virulent,
                    almost pathological anti-Americanism than I did in Canada. I've been in Germany
                    and in Belgium and other places, but it was almost an insidious anti-Americanism
                    exhibited by people who are superficially very much like us, who have similar
                    cultural background, but the Canadians - and obviously there are variations -
                    had a very strong resentment of the United States for our power, culturally,
                    politically, and militarily, as well as our proximity. It's a significant
                    reality I don=t think fully appreciated in the United States, where people
                    assume the Canadians are just like Americans. The intensity varies from one
                    region to another. Strongest by far in Ontario, the largest province of Canada.
                    That's important, of course. The anti-Americanism weakens as you go toward the
                    coasts, and if you get to Alberta or British Columbia or into the Maritimes, the
                    anti-Americanism is muted or doesn=t exist at all. Quebec is a separate case.
                    The Quebecers tend to be basically positive to the United States, mainly because
                    we're viewed as sort of a balancing force to English Canada. But the bottom line
                    is that particularly in the dominant English Canadian establishment concentrated
                    in Ontario, a strong undercurrent of anti-Americanism persists. I ran into it
                    constantly in the media and the universities. On the personal level, I hasten to
                    add, the Canadians are friendly, open, hospitable. But probing beneath the
                    surface, one finds an often hidden impulse of resentment as well as a sometimes
                    patronizing attitude that the United States is a violent, cold, culturally
                    defunct society in contrast to Canada.</p>
                <p>The attitude is not just the result of envy and insecurity but also a misguided
                    arrogance of presumed knowledge. One of the things I always used to say to the
                    Canadians (to Americans as well) was that the Americans know very little about
                    Canada, which is true, but the Canadians think they know more about us than they
                    really do. They have this arrogant belief that they know all about America=s
                    weaknesses, problems, and shortcomings, but it is, however, a distorted image of
                    the United States shaped by popular culture and American network news, which of
                    course are accessible across Canada. Their direct knowledge - and this is true
                    of most Canadians - of the United States is limited to Florida...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or Myrtle Beach.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Or Myrtle Beach or maybe New York City, which they like to visit.
                    But one USIS activity was the International Visitor program, where we selected
                    individuals from a variety of fields and send them around the United States to
                    get acquainted with our country. And we had a fairly large program in Canada,
                    and people would always ask, particularly in Washington, “Why do you have a
                    program for Canadians to come visit the United States? They can just go across
                    the border and go to a shopping mall,” which many of them do. But the program
                    obviously was not a shopping trip. We took them to all parts of the United
                    States, and invariably, when these people came back - including people who were
                    anti-American by instinct - invariably would say, “You know, I'm a Canadian, anI
                    thought I knew the United States, but I never, never did. I saw America on this
                    trip through eyes that I'd never used before.” I think - like most Canadians -
                    they never appreciated the size of the United States, because they think that
                    they have a large country (which they do), but they didn't realize how much
                    larger we are in both our geography as well as population with all the regional
                    variety, which most Canadians do not understand. They had especially little
                    appreciation for those mainstream values and experiences found in Middle America
                    in the small towns and cities, which I knew from my own Midwestern roots. Going
                    to New York City or to Florida doesn=t really expose them to the reality of the
                    United States, which we helped to provide by the IV program that emphasized the
                    variety and diversity of the United States. It was a revelation to the
                    Canadians.</p>
                <p>Q: I would also suspect that the Canadians really don't know their country very
                    well. I mean, just from what I gather - I may be wrong - people in Ottawa don't
                    bounce over to the Maritimes or to Alberta or something. If they're going to
                    somewhere, they're going to New York or Florida.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, that's true. One distinct impression I had after being in
                    Canada for those years is that the country tends remarkably to be even more
                    diverse and decentralized country than the United States. We are a diverse,
                    multicultural country but in Canada they deliberately sanction and cultivate the
                    heterogeneous character of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mosaic. They're not a melting pot.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The “mosaic” is what they constantly cite. They're not a melting pot
                    (i.e. like the United States); they're a mosaic. And their provinces exercise
                    far more authority than do our states. The national government is much weaker.
                    And culturally, of course, we know the French-English gap which exists, but it
                    goes beyond that. There=s a profound regional diversity. The people in the far
                    west of Canada almost look upon Ottawa as a foreign capital. In many ways, the
                    people in British Columbia have more in common with the people of Washington
                    State or Oregon than they do with the people of Ontario. So there is clearly a
                    vast diversity, almost an estrangement, among the different peoples of Canada
                    that creates a continuing tension and distrust among the different parts of the
                    country. It's not just the French-English problem, which of course continues to
                    simmer, but a deliberately cultivated society which is a collection of many
                    widely varying communities and regions. And I don't know whether that's going to
                    work over the long term, particularly given the geography. They're spread like a
                    thin ribbon across the continent, with most of the population concentrated in an
                    area 100 miles from the U.S. border. Lacking confidence in their own unity, the
                    Canadians always seem to be worrying about American annexation, which seems
                    impossible to us but is a recurring theme among Canadians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: God forbid!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: And I would constantly say, “Listen, we have enough problems coping
                    with our own 50 states and our own problems.” The United States hardly would
                    want to take on more territory. But the Canadians have a great deal of
                    insecurity and unease about the deficiencies of their own country, an
                    explanation in fact for the patronizing, anti-American attitudes which one
                    encounters. They view us as a society where there's more violence, more
                    incivility, more tension, and more inequality, a contrast to their self-image as
                    a humane, orderly country. The problem, as they've found in the last decade or
                    so, is that the so-called just society can be expensive. Their celebrated
                    national health insurance program, which on paper is very attractive, was
                    starting in the early 90s and now is getting worse to bankrupt the country and
                    compromise the quality of health care that they have - so that people with
                    really serious problems often go to the United States for treatment. Canada is
                    finding the elaborate, jealously protected social net more and more difficult to
                    maintain.</p>
                <p>Q: I have a cousin who lives in Canada, and she came down to Johns Hopkins as a
                    surgeon.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It=s unfortunate, but Canadians have harbored this self-image of
                    being superior to us in different ways, which simply reflects the underlying
                    resentment toward our political, economic, and cultural power. Because they are
                    a relatively small country next to this giant, powerful society, it makes them
                    feel both vulnerable as well as self-conscious.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Q: Well, one last question and then I'll put at the end what . . . because we'll
                    continue this discussion. One of the things that I've heard is that the
                    Canadians really don't have in their own minds much of a history, and so they
                    sort of define themselves as not being Americans.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, that analysis has a great validity, rooted in a sense of their
                    own lack of history as an extension mainly of the British Empire as well as the
                    cultural fragmentation between French and English Canada. Canada was not really
                    totally independent of Great Britain until the 1960s, and so they have not had
                    an identity apart from the Commonwealth and the British Crown that the United
                    States enjoyed for more than 200 years. There is no real ideological or cultural
                    unity for Canadians. They define themselves primarily in terms of not being
                    American, a fragmented, decentralized society and culture united mainly by
                    hockey, but most of those teams are now in the States as well.</p>
                <p>The Canadians are a wonderful, hospitable people and I enjoyed making friends
                    there. On a social level, there is little anti-Americanism and they exude a
                    sophistication and cultural level that really enhances an assignment there. They
                    were a delightful four years for my wife and me to travel their country - and a
                    beautiful country it is. But one is still left with a sense of incompleteness
                    and insecurity about Canada. Whether it will all one day unravel and North
                    America emerge as a single massive unit is hard to predict right now, but
                    nothing is impossible over the long term. We=ll see.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, well, we'll pick this up the next time. We've talked about the Canadian
                    attitude towards the United States and all, but I'd like to talk on more
                    specifics - one, we haven't covered the ambassador or ambassadors who were there
                    at the time-</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Three of them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -and how they dealt with the situation; the North Atlantic

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Free Trade Agreement; the cultural wars; and your

                <p>Today is the 16th of August, 1999. Dell, let's talk first about thambassadors you
                    had and you felt they operated in this situation.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I had three ambassadors during my four-year tour, whicmade it
                    challenging and interesting at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your four-year tour was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: From 1990 to 1994, and so I had an exposure to three very different
                    chief of mission personalities and managerial styles. They were all political
                    ambassadors, but yet they each had positive qualities and an effectiveness which
                    belied the common image of an inept, inexperienced political appointee rewarded
                    for campaign contributions. They were, I think, very good ambassadors in their
                    own ways, particularly because each had high-level connections in Washington. In
                    Canada that=s very important, an ambassador who has the access, who has the
                    ability to pick up the phone. Canadians regard the political connection as
                    absolutely important. They view the Canada-U.S. relationship as indeed very
                    special, and a political ambassador is perhaps more appropriate in Canada than
                    in practically any country in the world. And each of the three, I think, did the
                    job quite well.</p>
                <p>My first ambassador was Edward Ney, the former president and CEO of Young and
                    Rubicam, the public relations worldwide conglomerate, prominent in New York
                    business and social circles, and of course a fundraiser for George Bush. He had
                    been in Ottawa for a year or two before I arrived and was close to then Prime
                    Minister Brian Mulroney. Ney was an older gentleman, well into his 70s,
                    patrician and dignified in style, which I think some people found made him a
                    little bit distant. But I myself was impressed by his keen interest in USIA
                    programs, perhaps a result of his public relations background. In fact, he was
                    the primary force that got a Fulbright Program started in Canada.</p>

                <p>Ironically, although we've had Fulbright Programs in more than 100 countries over
                    the last 40 years, we never had one in Canada, and Ed Ney quickly recognized
                    that vacuum and took it upon himself as really his biggest ambassadorial legacy
                    to create a Fulbright Program in Canada. I think he realized, as we all do when
                    we've come to Canada as career or political diplomats, that the Canadians and
                    the Americans do not understand each other very well. We're in a real sense so
                    close but yet so far. Geographically and culturally we're linked in many ways,
                    but our histories, our psychologies, our cultures are very different. Such an
                    educational exchange initiative as the Fulbright program was absolutely
                    essential. And Ambassador Ney worked hard to get the program launched, sometimes
                    against a reluctant bureaucracy, which ignorantly wondered why Fulbright was
                    needed in Canada. I was delighted to be Ney=s partner in getting the program
                    launched, but he was the dominant force, particularly in fund-raising. The
                    Canada program was and remains the only one in the world funded primarily by
                    non-government funds. He did a superb job of fund-raising. He assembled a
                    powerful board of directors, who further enhanced the fund-raising reach of the
                    program. Fulbright in Canada today continues to prosper and makes, I think, a
                    truly important contribution to Canadian-American relations.</p>
                <p>Ed Ney was close to Mulroney, which paralleled the affinity of Mulroney and
                    President Bush. At the time, there was clearly a special U.S. relationship with
                    the Conservative government in Canada, which ultimately, however, failed,
                    because of its inability to solve the nagging French-English divide that has
                    separated Canada. Mulroney, who started off an extremely popular prime minister,
                    left with poll numbers scratching the bottom of the barrel.</p>
                <p>Ney departed with less than a year left in the Bush Administration. He had served
                    there for four years, and it was basically his time to move on. But he did leave
                    a very important legacy, the Fulbright Program and I think overall was an
                    effective chief of mission. I understood that he originally wanted to be
                    Director of USIA in the Bush administration but did not get it. He would have
                    been, I think, a very good USIA director.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, with his background in public relations, did he seize on the cultural
                    wars, you know, the Canadian effort to try to keep American advertising and
                    programming from spilling over into Canada?</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, during his tenure this was less a front-burner issue than it
                    became later under his two successors. It has always been, of course, a matter
                    of sensitivity in Canada, the concern about American cultural predominance in
                    North America. It's something that ambassadors as well as the embassies have
                    attempted to address quietly, because clearly there is a plausible case that
                    American culture - because it has the advantages of scale, of resources, merely
                    the size of the country - will overwhelm and dwarf Canada, an inevitable and
                    natural imbalance. But at the same time we're dealing with what is supposed to
                    be a free, open market of culture and ideas, and no one is forcing the Canadians
                    to see American movies or buy American magazines and books. I think our position
                    has always been to respect Canadian sensitivity on the issue but at the same
                    time pointing out the trade and the commercial rights that are basically
                    inherent in any free-market economy in the world. Ney, like his successors, both
                    Republican and Democrat, have pressed this point. But it is an intractable issue
                    in the relationship that is not going to go away very easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, did USIS at this time get involved in that, or
                        wathat more almost on the economic and political side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It was handled primarily in quiet behind-the-scenes diplomacy and
                    negotiation rather than in an open public diplomacy way. We did not stand to
                    gain much by provoking debate or attention to the issue. As I mentioned, while
                    American culture was undeniably not only very popular but very dominant, our
                    position was based on commercial and trade law, which the embassy pressed
                    quietly. And I think in general we've done pretty well with the exception of
                    tough Canadian limits on U.S. magazine editions sold in Canada. It is curious,
                    however, that the Canadians who try so desperately to limit American presence in
                    their country are never hesitant to seize any cultural opportunity here. The
                    Cineplex Odeon theater network, one of the largest distribution networks in the
                    United States, is Canadian-owned. To say nothing of Seagrams and Universal
                    Studios, but the Canadians usually just smile about that form of cultural
                    imperialism.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, yes?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: And of course, Americans don't protest, but anything similar in
                    Canada would be immediately and fiercely resisted. So there's a little hint of
                    hypocrisy in their jealous protest of American culture. A lot of it was - and I
                    found this true in many aspects of the Canadian critique of the United States -
                    that because the Canadians themselves are so fragmented, divided, diverse, about
                    the only thing that unites them is being Not American. In other words, to be
                    Canadian is to be not American, and that is really what sort of unites the
                    country, or at least large segments of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, Ney was followed by whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Ney was followed for a relatively brief tenure by Peter-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ney must have left in ninety-what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: He left in early '92, I believe it was, replaced by Peter Teeley,
                    who was a very different personality, considerably younger. He had served as
                    press secretary to Vice President Bush and was close to the President, but he
                    was in style and approach a contrast to his predecessor. He was what one might
                    call or liked to think of himself as a blue-collar ambassador. Much more
                    relaxed, more open, more accessible, and even prided himself on his
                    working-class origins. And he particularly relished - again, building on his
                    longtime experience as a press secretary - in personal relations with
                    journalists. And so he was passionately interested in developing personal
                    contacts and social relationships with the Canadian media community, which was
                    rather unusual for an American ambassador. The Canadian journalists were
                    initially somewhat surprised, but then eventually delighted in this man who
                    would literally spend workday afternoons in a bar or restaurant with them,
                    trading stories and jokes over rounds of beer. The ambassador actually loved
                    this type of interaction, and often on a Sunday afternoon I would get a call
                    from him wanting me to get a few journalists and come over and have a few drinks
                    to enjoy Sunday afternoon over at the residence. It was, again, a rather unusual
                    style, but I think that as a result, the Canadian media did warm up to him and
                    in a sense to the United States. Given the brevity of his tenure, only a matter
                    of months (he, of course, left after the election of Bill Clinton in '92), he
                    never was able to get involved in the substance of Canadian-American relations
                    as much as his predecessor or successor, but I think he was a good ambassador.
                    And if George Bush had been reelected, he would have stayed on and probably
                    would have had a very successful tenure as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, he was succeeded by whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: He was succeeded by another quite different personality, Jim
                    Blanchard, the former governor or Michigan and a long-time friend and political
                    ally of Bill Clinton. Blanchard had been apparently a prominent candidate for a
                    cabinet post in the new Clinton Administration, Secretary of Commerce, but did
                    not get it mainly because, I understand, they wanted an Hispanic in the Cabinet
                    and the position went to Secretary Pena. Canada was in a sense, I guess, a
                    consolation prize for Blanchard - although he never really acknowledged or said
                    that. And in the interest and the enthusiasm and the passion he brought to the
                    job, he certainly demonstrated that he was absolutely committed to being
                    ambassador. He was, again, in my experience with these ambassadors in Canada as
                    well as others over the years, the quintessential political animal. I've never
                    known anybody who breathed, lived and exuded politics so completely. This had
                    been, of course, his life's profession, and he knew the nuances and the
                    intricacies of politics, both American and Canadian, exceptionally well. And of
                    course he also had good ties - probably the best of the three ambassador- with
                    the Washington policy community. He knew all the cabinet officers and of course
                    the President, and he had extremely good access that I think resulted in his
                    very effective and productive tenure as ambassador.</p>
                <p>He set forth, really, two priorities as his primary interests. One was, of
                    course, the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, which was concluded during that
                    period. The very intense debate in the United States over NAFTA was, in large
                    part, mirrored in Canada, where it took on, again, maybe an even more emotional,
                    even irrational element because of the anti-American paranoia in many circles.
                    The NAFTA was viewed as another example of opening up Canada to American
                    companies and products, undermining Canadian industry, and so on. And it was a
                    sharp debate that divided Canada, as the bilateral Free Trade Agreement had
                    several years earlier. But I think Blanchard - primarily working quietly
                    behind-the-scenes because for us to get overtly and very publicly involved in
                    the Canadian debate would have been counterproductive - but he developed good
                    relations with the new premier, Jean Chretien, and his staff and was very
                    effective in interpreting and explaining the American political scene as well as
                    showing to Canadians that the great advantages that came with NAFTA - the access
                    to the American and the Mexican markets - and how Canada, as a small country,
                    really in the end would benefit more than be hurt by it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: As a very political person, from the very start, he recognized the
                    importance of public diplomacy. Even before he arrived in the country, we were
                    talking on the phone, working on different things that we wanted to do in a
                    public relations context. The first thing he did - literally, before he even
                    started work in Ottawa - was a transcontinental train trip across Canada to meet
                    people and to get a sense of the country- (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Ambassador Blanchard was intensely public relations conscious, but always, of
                    course, linked to finely tuned political objectives and activities. He was a
                    regular on the various Canadian TV talk shows and did a fair amount of public
                    speaking as well. All of this was coordinated by USIS and required me to work
                    closely with him. He became - I like to think - a good friend and colleague, who
                    took me into his confidence on some of his political interests. At one time
                    there was a great deal of speculation that he would return and run for the
                    Senate in Michigan in 1994, which stirred up a lot of media and public interest.
                    He was consulting with people in Michigan as well as in Washington. There's no
                    doubt that he seriously considered it, but I think in the end he did not mainly
                    because he was taken with the challenge in Canada and thought he could
                    accomplish more there than as a junior senator from Michigan. He never mentioned
                    it, but as it turned out, 1994 was a Republican year (the famous Gingrich
                    revolution) and it probably would not have been a good year to run for Congress,
                    particularly in a volatile, bellwether state such as Michigan. He did tell me
                    that if the President had personally weighed heavily on him to run for the
                    Senate as an act of loyalty to the Democratic Party, he would have done it. But
                    that did not come. I don=t even know whether he really talked to the President
                    about it, but after a lot of back and forth with the people in Michigan and
                    Washington, he decided not to run for the Senate and he stayed on.</p>
                <p>And I think it was probably the administration's and the country's advantage
                    because he was exceptionally effective, not only with presiding over NAFTA's
                    acceptance in Canada and in the United States, but also with his other defining
                    policy priority, the Open Skies Agreement, to open up long obstructed commercial
                    aviation links between the two countries. Getting from one side of the border to
                    the other side had been very difficult and expensive by plane because of the
                    severe constraints on American carrier access into Canada. The ambassador really
                    did an absolutely marvelous job, both publicly and behind the scenes, to get
                    that agreement approved, which has yielded enormous gains for both countries in
                    both tourism and trade. It really has opened up things because now travel is
                    much easier and much less expensive with increased competition and additional
                    city-to-city connections. So when it came to NAFTA and to the Open Skies, I
                    thinAmbassador Blanchard was a truly outstanding chief of mission, and I was
                    very proud to have been part of his team. And because he was so public-relations
                    conscious, I think USIS had an especially major role in the mission.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now, he's written a book, by the way.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: That's right. I've read it and I=d rank it among the best
                    ambassadorial memoirs.</p>
                <p>Q: It's quite a good book, a short book, but it gives you a real window. I think
                    it's called something like A Window on - I can't, anyway, it came out around '97
                    or-</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, it actually came out last year, I think.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I was actually very surprised that the book did not get more
                    attention here in the United States. The only way I heard about it was from
                    friends in Canada who told me that he was up there doing book tours. Naturally,
                    the book aroused a great deal of interest in Canada - and mostly favorable, I'm
                    told - but I have never seen a review of it in The Washington Post or The New
                    York Times, which is critical for such a book in stimulating U.S. readership. I
                    may have missed it, but as far as I know, it was surprisingly neglected here in
                    the States. I can=t explain it, because it was, in my opinion, one of the better
                    diplomatic memoirs ever written.</p>

                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: That was, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you talk about how the embassy reacted before and during this period, I
                    mean, what sort of was expected and how it came and did it cause any problems
                    for you?</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The Mulroney government had been very pro-American and identified
                    closely with George Bush and Washington. Mulroney and Canada had been a strong
                    supporter of the U.S. in the Persian Gulf War. But the longstanding identity
                    with the United States during the Reagan and Bush years probably worked against
                    him, especially in Ontario, the largest (and most Ameriphobic) Canadian
                    province. He became closely associated with the Americans, which only stirred up
                    the latent sensitivities among Canadians about the United States. Canadians just
                    don=t like their leaders to be too close to Washington. And that hurt Mulroney.
                    There's no doubt about it. I think the embassy was very much aware of this, and
                    certainly our position was starkly neutral. But everybody in the embassy - and
                    across Canada - sense that the Conservatives were headed toward a major defeat.
                    It was plain to everyone. Even the most astute Canadian experts, however, could
                    not anticipate how the Tories were almost totally wiped out in Parliament. It
                    was a Conservative catastrophe related also to the Mulroney failure to bridge
                    the simmering Quebec/English Canada tension. As an Anglophone, French-speaking
                    Quebecer, he staked much on bridging the gulf separating Canadians, but he ended
                    up alienating both sides. I don=t think in the embassy there was any great
                    apprehension about the new Liberal government, which exhibited a more
                    nationalist tendency than did the Conservatives, although it wasn't always the
                    case over a period of time. A conservative PM like Diefenbaker was perhaps the
                    most anti-American premier we've ever had in Ottawa, but there was some concern
                    that maybe Jean Chretien might put more distance between himself and Washington
                    to avoid replicating the experience of Mulroney. And certainly that was the case
                    initially. There was no doubt that Chretien was not going to be in Washington or
                    Maine every other week. But we were clearly - not only during the campaign but
                    afterward - reassured that there was not going to be any real anti-U.S.
                    orientation in the new government, that they were going to stay the course on
                    free trade, that they were going to remain strong allies - which, of course,
                    they've done. So I think even though while the embassy recognized that an
                    entirely new crew was taking power with the Liberals coming to power, we
                    recognized that the relationship would continue to be strong, as indeed it has
                    been.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you giving out any cautions to your colleagues in USIS. Usually the idea
                    is to get as much about America in, a fairly aggressive selling America - that's
                    what USIS does - but particularly during and election time or in Canada, I'd
                    think you'd almost want to keep it low key.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, we kept that pretty much in control in Ottawa. I was country
                    public affairs officer and able to monitor and moderate any tendencies that
                    might be coming out of Washington. Because Canada was geographically separate
                    from the rest of the world, you didn't have people sort of launching propaganda
                    volleys directly at Canada. We were able to pretty much control that, and we did
                    keep a deliberately low profile in the campaign. USIA operations in Canada have
                    always been unlike USIS operations elsewhere in the world, reflecting a
                    necessarily more low-key, low-profile approach to public diplomacy. We've never
                    had big cultural centers or major programs like we have in other countries. Most
                    of our work has been largely quietly in the background working with
                    universities, working with community groups, trying in a measured way to present
                    the American positions. And doing the same, of course, with the media as well -
                    depending on the issue and depending on the ambassador as well. It's a very
                    different kind of place to run a USIS program.</p>
                <p>Q: Talking about some of the foreign affairs issues, how did the Gulf War - we're
                    talking about when Iraq invaded Kuwait and our counter proposal: George Bus
                    assembled a very effective force against this - how did that play initially in
                    Canada as these things went on?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The Canadians were on board from the beginning in the Gulf War, and
                    were active, reliable, and effective partners in the Allied coalition. It was,
                    in large part, a direct result of the close Bush-Mulroney relationship, but I
                    think the Canadian people did realize that this was a serious act which Saddam
                    Hussein had committed flagrant aggression against Kuwait and something had to be
                    done. Canadian forces did participate, at least they had some aircraft in the
                    coalition action. We didn't have, really, any type of public affairs problem on
                    that issue, certainly compared to what happened in other countries in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Cuba? I always feel that Cuba is almost the designated hitter as
                    far as this is where the Canadians can show they really differ from the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Absolutely, and with both conservative or liberal administrations in
                    Ottawa, this has always been something that separated the United States and
                    Canada. It has been a serious public relations problem, something that we did
                    work on with limited success. The Canadians clearly feel that human rights and
                    democracy can be advanced there through political engagement, trade, and
                    tourism, and they have told us this many, many times. Of course, there has been
                    some self-serving profit for Canadian business, which has benefited from the
                    absence of the United States. So perhaps it is not all just ideological purity;
                    there are clearly some commercial reasons involved. But it is something that has
                    been a nagging sore in Canadian-American relations, particularly when we try to
                    impose any sort of extraterritoriality in our policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>The Canadians have never fully appreciated the depth and the influence of the
                    Cuban community in the United States. As with many other things, the Canadians
                    really do not have a good understanding of the American political system. They
                    really look at everything through the parliamentary optic. They see other
                    governments and cannot understand that they operate very differently, and
                    certainly the United States, a federal system, with its separation of powers, is
                    a very much more complicated democratic system. There is no prime minister who
                    basically is the legislative and executive authority, and they never have really
                    understood that fact very well. And of course, it's not only true with Canada
                    but with many other countries in the world, but it is ironic that here our
                    closest neighbor, linked to us in so many ways, has had such a blind spot when
                    it comes to the politics of the United States.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, was there any effort on our part to say, “Okay, you Canadians have been
                    working on this so-called 'close relationship' with Castro for the last 30
                    years, and human rights haven't gotten any better”?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Of course, we've made that point to them, and they feel that this is
                    a long-term, cumulative process. The noble impulse perhaps belies the commercial
                    objectives and purposes, but in some ways, I personally am sympathetic to the
                    idea of some engagement with Cuba. Hostage to a handful of Cuban emigres upset
                    that Castro won and Batista lost, I think maybe we do close ourselves off to
                    that country more than we should. I saw first hand how commercial and cultural
                    relationships with other communist countries was absolutely critical in opening
                    up those societies. And, why should it be any different with Cuba? It is small
                    and geographically close to the United States and probably will be far more
                    vulnerable to change and external influence than was Eastern Europe. But we
                    ourselves have helped to maintain the Iron Curtain around Cuba, which I think is
                    a major reason that Castro=s communism has outlasted his comrades in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the various ethnic groups that were coming
                        intCanada? I mean, they take great pride in saying they're a - what is
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: A mosaic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A mosaic - and did you find, were you looking at these
                        variouethnic groups and targeting things towards them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, I think that we didn't want to get involved in any identified
                    ethnic separatism or targeting. In a way, the Canadians, in my judgment,
                    probably did too much of that themselves. It was extraordinary how they
                    adamantly reject the idea of assimilation and a melting pot - again, trying hard
                    to make themselves different from the United States. But the mosaic ends up, in
                    many ways, a blurred and confusing kaleidoscope with a bewildering array of
                    ethnic communities actually financially supported by the government. In other
                    words, they're able to develop their cultural programs and activities with the
                    assistance of the government, a deliberate policy by the Canadian government to
                    encourage multiculturalism. And as a result, you do have not just the
                    French-English chasm separating Canada, but cultural barriers erected by the
                    minorities that have come in just in the last 10 to 20 years, particularly from
                    Asia, especially from the Far East, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean. But it
                    just further erodes the already thin sense of being Canadian, which Canadians
                    are always trying without success to define. The mosaic unfortunately pulls
                    apart Canada rather then brings it together. It is such a contrast to the
                    American experience, which is historically that of a melting pot where
                    assimilation is the main objective and ancestral cultural loyalties are steadily
                    diminished. But certainly in Canada that is not the case, and I think in the
                    long term that's not going to help the country.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I would think, too, that you would build up a big infrastructure of
                    people who were essentially bureaucratic tribal leaders of the Greek community
                    or the what-have-you who really almost will try to do everything to make sure
                    that Greek marries Greek and that they don't. . . . very much like the old ward
                    politics of New York, where the idea was to keep them segregated in their little
                    ghettos and not let them get out.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, you're absolutely right. That is happening across Canada. The
                    development of these tribal communities is rampant in places such as Toronto or
                    Montreal or Vancouver, which has a very large Asian population. All of this is
                    not bringing the country together. It is dividing the country, and I think a
                    disturbing trend. They were never able to solve the French-English problem, and
                    they still haven't been able to, and now, on top of that, is this elaborate
                    network of other ethnic communities compounding the French-English problem.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume that you got involved in speeches and this sort of thing, and you and
                    your colleagues. Was it hard to be frank - I mean the way we're talking now - or
                    did you just keep off subjects, like saying “We're going for the melting pot;
                    you're going for the mosaic; and frankly, we do it this way and we think our
                    thing is going to come out better than yours”?</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Certainly in public speeches I would try to be a little bit
                    diplomatic and not as challenging in my remarks, but in private with Canadians,
                    I would not pull my punches and make my views clearly understood about the
                    mosaic and the implications for Canadian unity. And, many Canadians acknowledged
                    the problem. It was not something they automatically defended. I think the idea
                    that every ethnic or linguistic community must retain and strengthen its
                    separate identity has become so deeply embedded in the Canadian political fabric
                    - if you will, a form of political correctness - that it isn't going to change
                    very easily. They are a society much more decentralized than is the United
                    States. The provinces have significantly greater power than our states do.
                    Ottawa is really rather weak compared to Washington in terms of its national
                    authority, and that sort of decentralization continues with a society rippled by
                    the many ethnic communities. Canada just does not have the strong unifying
                    elements which helped bring together the United States as a nation, particularly
                    after our civil war. Part of it ultimately goes back to the decisions made in
                    the 18th century by the British, who at that time, once they had consolidated
                    control of Canada and North America at that point, decided that assimilation
                    would not be pursued in French Canada. A decision to break down cultural and
                    linguistic differences, traumatic in the short term, might have had a much
                    better outcome for the country. But they decided in the 18th century that French
                    culture and language would be respected and maintained, and of course that
                    planted the seeds of the disharmony and alienation we have witnessed over the
                    last century. And it also set a precedent for future decisions about ethnic
                    rights and ethnic identity at the end of the 20th century.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you find much of this impetus towards this - because this has really
                    increased even in the last 20 or more years, hasn't it as different groups come
                    in? Was there a sort of an intellectual engine, the intellectuals, who seem to
                    play a little greater role than they do in the United States, the “chattering
                    class?”</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It was certainly true in Quebec in the debate over association with
                    Canada, which has taken place over the last 20 years. The intellectuals were the
                    primary force for Quebec separatism, an impulse now generally in remission but
                    almost certainly to return if les Quebecois see any cause of humiliation or
                    discrimination by the rest of Canada. Younger, better educated Quebecers born
                    after World War II have been much less influenced by the traditional
                    subservience or inferiority complex of the French Canadian and have cultivated
                    in their arts, media and political discourse a bolder, more confident
                    nationalism that will not go away. They have reflected a feisty, unintimidated
                    spirit similar to anti-American nationalism in English Canada - again, mainly in
                    the chattering class, the intellectuals, university professors, media people -
                    that is much less mirrored in the ordinary man-on-the-street.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Q: I've heard, and I don=t want to overstress this “them versus us,” but I've
                    heard, and I think Blanchard in his book brings this out, that in the Canadian
                    bureaucracy it's almost as though. . . and the bureaucracy has been brought up
                    in the Cold War, and the Cold War is Canada versus the United States, and the
                    bureaucrats are trained . . . they win a battle if they can stick it to the
                    United States. It think this was in the Open Skies and all this that he
                    mentioned. And it has almost a life of its own. Did you sense any of this?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Yes, no doubt in the government bureaucracy as well as in the
                    intellectual community of Canada, there was an almost visceral enjoyment in
                    sticking it to the United States, showing how they are different, showing how
                    they aren't going to be pushed around by the United States. This happened even
                    in some of our very nonpolitical USIA-type programs and exchanges where they
                    could be occasionally difficult to deal and negotiate with. One had the sense
                    they were doing it particularly because it was a way that they could show that
                    they were independent of the United States. I think it's absolutely correct that
                    in all of our relationships nothing happens very easily or quickly because there
                    is the recurring impulse that we Canadians can't be too compliant, we can't be
                    too responsive, we have to show that we're Canadian. But in the end, as I
                    mentioned earlier, it's not so much that they're showing they're Canadian. It's
                    to show that they're not American. And because one really detects, in dealing
                    with Canadians, that they themselves aren't certain what is a Canadian. There is
                    this glaring absence of a unifying cultural and political theme, a lack of a
                    Canadian identity that ultimately translates into this, “Well, we've got to show
                    the Americans that we're not American.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find there was a difference - I would assume that most of what we are
                    talking about is pretty much Ontario-based - that when you got out into the west
                    you felt almost you could relax a bit more, these are more like us?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Oh, absolutely. Ontario was the hotbed of Canadian nationalism,
                    which often surfaced in some form of anti-Americanism. And I had a personal
                    family experience to understand this reality. My son was a high school student
                    when we went to Ottawa, and we ended up putting him in a private school in
                    Ottawa - in fact, a prestigious school called Ashbury College, sort of a
                    breeding ground for the Canadian English establishment over many, many years.
                    Naive about Canada and Canadian attitudes (like most Americans), we did not
                    fully anticipate the fact that our son was being brought into an environment
                    which in many ways was decidedly, although often subtly, unfriendly. He was the
                    only American in the whole secondary school, and even though the
                    anti-Americanism was not strident, it was clearly there. And it took time and
                    effort for him to develop a few Canadian friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>We mistakenly thought, as Americans usually do, that Canada was just like the
                    United States. Well, it wasn=t, and it was very different and particularly for
                    our son, it was a real challenge. Probably in the end he benefited from the
                    experience, but it was not easy, especially at the start. Other Americans
                    arrived at the school in a year or two. Perhaps the atmosphere has changed,
                    although a colleague who has a child there now says Ashbury still has that sense
                    of Canadian entitlement and superiority which is often focused on the United
                    States. I remember one student assembly at Ashbury when a teacher was condemning
                    another student for chewing gum and said in a condescending way, “Why do you
                    want to be like the Americans?” Everybody, of course, knew that our son Kevin
                    was the only American there and they all turned and looked at him. Fortunately,
                    he wasn't chewing gum. But that sort of remark in a public situation clearly
                    illustrated the mood in that school, but I think it was generally concentrated
                    in English Canada, particularly in Ontario - but by far the largest province and
                    the most dominant in terms of the economics and culture of Canada.</p>
                <p>As you go towards either coast, the attitudes toward the United States really do
                    relax remarkably, and in a place like Calgary, Alberta, closely identified with
                    the energy industry, they almost proudly talk about themselves as being another
                    Houston, and they relish their ties with the United States. And in fact, Alberta
                    was settled primarily by Americans who, back in the last century, came up from
                    Montana in search of land during the 19th century. They did not come from
                    eastern Canada. So I think that even though living in Ontario there was a
                    recurring sense of anti-Americanism, particularly among the educated political
                    and cultural elites, you didn't get that impression very often in the East or
                    West of the country.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, I'm a great Anglophile, but I notice when I watch British television
                    in the programs we get here and all, there's a strong element in this of putting
                    people in their place, putting people down in social conditions. Did you find
                    that the good citizens of the upper class of Ontario worked hard to put you
                    Americans down and all that?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Not that significantly, no. I think that being American diplomats,
                    we had a fair degree of acceptance by the Ottawa and Ontario community. The
                    neighborhood where we lived was dominated by the Anglophone establishment,
                    wherAshbury College was located, with a strong Anglophilic tendency. And these
                    same people often had a somewhat patronizing attitude toward the cultural
                    barbarians to the south. But it wasn=t projected in an impolite or hostile way.
                    It's just that in dealing with these people - professionals, intellectuals,
                    university people - you could not escape an undercurrent of superiority and
                    smugness derived from their Anglophilic tendencies and connections. There's no
                    doubt about it. It was there. But it was not one that made daily life unbearable
                    or unpleasant.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find your colleagues that you dealt with in our consulates, both
                    in Nova Scotia - to the eastern provinces - Quebec, and then out into the
                    prairies and Vancouver? Were they different? I mean, was their world a different
                    world?</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Oh, absolutely. Because of the profoundly decentralized country, the
                    consulates were operating in very different environments. Their priorities,
                    their operating styles - everything was governed by that fact. But we at least,
                    certainly in USIA, we tried to work closely with our consular colleagues. We had
                    regular meetings bringing people together from the different USIS posts, trying
                    to get on the same page because advancing our common interests and activities
                    had to be done in very different cultural environments. And so working with the
                    consulates in Halifax, Quebec City, Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver
                    was a major challenge, but we at least recognized the problem and tried to
                    address it.</p>
                <p>Q: Particularly Vancouver, things were changing rapidly there. It was becoming a
                    Pacific city - I mean, a lot of people from Hong Kong and Asians and all that -
                    were you able to sort of encourage north-south relations, or did it just happen?
                    In other words, I would think Vancouver and Seattle and maybe San Francisco and
                    all would have such... I mean, those would be the ties, and in a way it would be
                    different, and particularly for a USIS-type operation you'd almost have to have
                    a different axis than you might have in Ontario.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: The people in the Northwest region, including not only British
                    Columbia but the states of Washington and Oregon, have a very special
                    relationship, economically as well as in other areas. There is constant movement
                    and interchange back and forth across the border. And in many ways there was a
                    greater sense of identity by the people of British Columbia with the American
                    Northwest than with Ottawa. In talking to people in Vancouver, there was clearly
                    a real element of distance and alienation from Ottawa not much weaker than the
                    intense feelings of Quebec separatism. There was no detectable interest in
                    separating the Canadian West and joining the United States - mainly because it
                    was not something the Americans really wanted - but culturally and economically
                    that region of North America has a lot in common. And the cultural and
                    psychological distance separating the Canadian West and the rest of Canada
                    should not be underestimated. But the Pacific orientation, because of trade and
                    the immigration you mentioned, is an equally strong force. I remember visiting
                    Simon Frazier University in Vancouver and discovering that they had a large
                    program in Indonesian studies, reflecting their region=s close ties with Asia. I
                    asked the president or the provost at the time, “I'm very impressed you have
                    this Indonesian studies program. Do you have an American studies program?” and
                    there was a blank look on his face. After a long pause he said, “Well, we really
                    don't think we need that.” Of course, this again is not just true in Vancouver,
                    but throughout Canada: the attitude that Canadians already know everything they
                    need to know about the United States. That was a principal reason we started the
                    Fulbright Program, a belief that the United States does need more scholarly
                    study and understanding. As I have said, the Canadians think that they know more
                    about the United States than they really do, while on the other side, the
                    Americans don't even think about Canada.</p>
                <p>Q: Are there any centers for Canadian studies here in the United States?</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: There=s an expanding network of Canadian studies programs around the
                    United States, funded at considerable expense by the Canadian government. They
                    put a lot of money into Canadian studies. But it is still largely limited to
                    academic specialists and has not taken root in the general population. Most
                    Americans pretty much take Canada for granted unless Quebec separatism starts to
                    get headlines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any American studies programs in Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Only a few. We worked on this but our budgetary resources were
                    limited, much less than what the Canadians did in our own country. I think there
                    were only three or four functioning centers across all of Canada, and usually
                    American studies in Canada really meant literature with relatively little
                    attention to the social sciences. Of course, this is true elsewhere in the world
                    as well. People everywhere are fascinated by American authors and literary
                    giants, but there just doesn't seem to be much interest in going deeper into the
                    social, cultural and political character of America. I think most people around
                    the world - particularly intellectuals and university communities - have deeply
                    fixed, ideologically distorted pictures of the United States, which they don=t
                    want to challenge or examine seriously. Too much of the world sees the United
                    States through the optic of CNN and popular journalism. The global information
                    revolution has not really eroded distortion and bias.</p>
                <p>Q: As we both know, you really would have to strain yourself to find good
                    American places where they study the American political system in Europe,
                    whereas an American - if you get a good liberal education - gets a pretty good
                    solid dose of certainly European government.</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: What is interesting is that though our histories, Canada and the
                    United States, are closely integrated, if you go into the Canadian schools - and
                    my son was there - you see everything through the Canadian perspective. The
                    American Revolution, the War of 1812, everything is all interpreted from a
                    British or Anglophile position, and there's really no serious attempt to
                    understand the United States. And this extends even to things like the American
                    Civil War. As we know, the Canadians, like the English, were in some ways not
                    only tolerated but actively encouraged the rebellion in the South. There were,
                    in fact, Southern combat units which actually operated from Ontario-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, the St. Albinos Raid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: -and so American history is poorly understood and studied in Canada,
                    although the United States is such an important country to them. You would think
                    that they would want to learn more about us, but they really don't make much
                    effort at least in the schools. Canadians go every year to Florida or maybe New
                    York City and think they know everything about the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the effectiveness - again from looking at it from
                    our embassy in Ottawa - of the Canadian embassy in Washington, DC, the
                    ambassadors, how they work with Congress, and all that?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I think the Canadian embassy in Washington is undoubtedly one of the
                    most effective mission that they have overseas. Again, it sort of belies the
                    fact that most Canadians don't understand the United States very well. That
                    doesn't seem to hold true with the embassy. It think that they're very well
                    connected and very savvy about how Washington operates. They work the halls of
                    Congress well. They have good ties within the foreign affairs bureaucracy as
                    well as in the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Canadian Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I worked quite a bit with the Ministry of External Affairs and with
                    the embassy here in Washington on a number of activities. I was overall very
                    impressed by the professionalism of their Foreign Service. And I've gotten to
                    know over the years many Canadian diplomats at other foreign postings. I think
                    that they really are a very impressive group of people. The idea of public
                    service in Canada still has, I think, a strong appeal, unlike, I fear, in the
                    United States, where the Kennedyesque summons to public service has faded over
                    the years. In Canada, however, you do get some really outstanding people going
                    into their Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find in dealing with the bureaucracy, the foreign affairs
                    establishment particularly, but others, that this effort to try to balance the
                    Frenchness and the Englishness and all - did that get in the way?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I don=t think it got in the way. It was obvious that the French
                    Canadians had a disproportionate presence within the Ministry of External
                    Affairs and I think in many federal ministries. I=m uncertain how deliberate or
                    contrived that outcome may have been. It may have been partly just a matter of
                    linguistic competence, because not only in the Foreign Service in Canada but
                    generally in the Canadian federal service, bilingualism in French and English is
                    required, which excludes many English Canadians who really can=t manage an
                    acceptable level in French. On the other hand, educated French Canadians almost
                    always speak English quite well. It was clearly apparent that the French
                    Canadians had a strong tradition within their Foreign Service. From time to time
                    you might detect some quiet griping about favoritism toward the Francophones by
                    a few English Canadians, but it wasn't that common. It was just a fact of life,
                    probably close to 50 per cent French Canadian, in their foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '94, you left, and whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: In '94, I left Ottawa and returned to Washington, which would become
                    my final assignment in the Foreign Service. I assumed the position of USIA=s
                    deputy associate director for educational and cultural affairs, the senior
                    career person in that bureau of USIA and by far the largest element, which
                    handled all of the exchange programs ranging from Fulbright and International
                    Visitors to a wide array of other exchange programs in the professional and
                    educational fields, particularly the burgeoning empire of exchanges involved
                    with the former USSR. We had a budget of $200 million or more and a staff in
                    Washington of 225 people. It was a major and challenging management job working
                    under a political appointee associate director, with me functioning in effect as
                    a chief operating officer dealing with day-to-day management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from '94 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: '94 to 1997.</p>
                <p>Q: You've been off and on, obviously having to deal with exchange programs and
                    all. How would you characterize your impression of the Clinton Administration,
                    which by this time had gotten its feet on the ground, towards educational
                    exchanges compared to maybe some of the others?</p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: I think that my work in that bureau was in many ways was
                    simultaneously challenging, rewarding, and difficult - even exasperating. It was
                    the period when USIA's demise or integration into the State Department was
                    consummated. The process leading to that was one I found both confusing and
                    frustrating. Although there was nominal lip service support for educational
                    exchange as well as public diplomacy in general was there, the Clinton
                    Administration really had a somewhat distant, even uneasy relationship with what
                    USIA did. I think there was in this administration a sense that USIA was a relic
                    of the Cold War, which had been preaching American ideology and propaganda to
                    the world. The Clinton Administration did not have a sense of American mission
                    or exceptionalism and was uncomfortable with the idea of telling America=s story
                    to the world. That is a mainly intuitive judgment on my part but I just did not
                    detect, even in the Agency=s management, a strong commitment to what we had done
                    for more than 40 years. And that, in my judgment, is what finally led to the
                    decision to eliminate the Agency and shift its functions to the Department.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, this is also a time - you got there in '94, and the election of 94
                    brought in practically a know-nothing Congress, I mean, a . . . God, that's
                    probably as good a term as one can think about it, and with the same
                    connotations that the Know-Nothings had about foreign affairs back in the
                    pre-Civil War times. Did you feel that you had lost some of your support in
                    Congress for the exchange and for internationalism?</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: No, I think that it wasn't just the '94 elections but probably began
                    with the end of the Cold War. There developed in the Congress and elsewhere in
                    the country a degree of uncertainty about why we needed these programs. We won
                    the Cold War; they served their purpose; and did we really now have to continue
                    them? That certainly became stronger feeling after 1994 with the new pressure on
                    reducing budgets and cutting backing government. And so in my work in USIA at
                    the time, we were really selling two audiences. One, you had the Republican
                    Congress, which was looking at the issue through a budgetary optic and wondering
                    why do we need these programs when we can save money. And then, the other one
                    was the administration itself, because I do feel that there was sort of an
                    ideological resistance to what USIA did and the perception that such programs
                    were Cold War relics. And it was a challenging piece of work for me. It was not
                    easy and often frustrating because what I had invested more than 30 years now
                    was under attack. Our budgets did decline - although not as dramatically as they
                    might have - but they was a downward slide during that period that required a
                    good deal of juggling and adjustment.</p>
                <p>I think in this world of the Internet and the mobility of people moving back and
                    forth across borders and oceans all the time as well as the instantaneous,
                    real-time access to information, we are seduced into a false sense of security
                    and confidence about what we know about the world. We superficially believe
                    we're in touch with the world, but in the end, of course, you don't understand
                    other societies and cultures and people simply by looking at CNN or staring at a
                    computer screen.</p>
                <p>Now this is in both directions. It's Americans looking out and foreigners looking
                    in. So in a sense, because we live in a world where superficially we're in
                    contact and have this pretense of a global village, we may have even more need
                    now for information and exchange programs. The case has still not been made as
                    effectively as it could have, and I certainly share in that inadequacy, but the
                    main problem, at least in the Clinton Administration was the tendency to USIA as
                    being more or less peripheral in foreign policy and not a major player. And
                    that's the key issue now as USIA moves into the State Department. The danger is
                    very real that USIA functions and programs will become marginalized and exiled
                    to the periphery of State Department priorities, and then will wither away. Now
                    again, I could be wrong, but I'm just not persuaded - despite the rhetorical
                    commitment by the Secretary of State and others - that it's going to have the
                    centrality of purpose and the sense of mission that it did in an independent
                    agency. But the jury is still out on this.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, with exchanges, I would have thought in this time that there would have
                    been a certain push to try to get a lot of exchanges with these newly emerging
                    states from the Ex-Soviet Union and all that, and also what had been the Eastern
                    Bloc.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It was certainly a growth industry with strong support in both the
                    Administration as well as in the Congress, to try to do something that would
                    help in the democratic movement within the former communist states. For example,
                    Senator Bradley became personally committed to the idea of expanding the
                    exchange of high school students and arranged for earmarked funds that started
                    up a program that has proved to be, I think, very successful, bringing students
                    from the former Soviet Union to the United States to spend a whole academic
                    year. And of course such experiences dramatically change these young people and
                    over the long term will be a very positive force in the way these societies
                    evolve in the 21st century.</p>
                <p>There were other programs that evoked special congressional interest as well as
                    people at the top of the administration who were interested this as well. So we
                    had a growth industry to sort of keep us going and our program offices at full
                    pace, but it was really only in that area. We were really struggling to fund
                    other parts of the exchange program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that Western Europe would have almost
                        fallen ofthe radar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: It certainly is an area where over the last 10 years in both
                    exchanges and in other program areas we cut back dramatically, to the point
                    where for example in the Fulbright Program with Germany now is funded largely by
                    the Germans. And, the same holds in other countries where the interest in
                    exchanges with the United States really is stronger in the host country than
                    here. And it reflects the diminishing general support we've had for public
                    diplomacy programs of all kinds. In a world where the United States is so
                    dominant and unchallenged, there is a short-sighted complacency that questions
                    the need for these or any other international resource commitments. It's
                    unsettling because we are putting ourselves at risk in a world which is more
                    diverse and complicated in a cultural sense than ever before. Samuel
                    Huntington=s book AClash of Civilizations@ summarizes the reality well. The
                    collapse of the Cold War only has revealed and unleashed an entirely new form of
                    international conflict and tension rooted in cultural and sectarian differences.
                    And, the new world disorder, if one might call it that, requires a commitment to
                    intellectual engagement and interaction which simply must go beyond the Internet
                    and CNN. And I think that we really need to do more, rather than less, in the
                    field of public diplomacy, but so far that concern has fallen on deaf ears. And,
                    I believe, both the Administration and the Republican Congress share
                    responsibility for this neglect, which will only come back to haunt us just as
                    we saw happen with America=s retrenchment after World War I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the last decades, one of our major concerns has
                        been the growth of fundamentalism, particularly in Islam. Is this a place we
                        could do anything about exchange-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Oh, I think definitely we could, and we have done some things, but
                    clearly not enough. Our approach to the fundamentalist Islam must be nuanced and
                    very deliberate, but there's no doubt we could do more to open up our channels
                    of communication and engagement with the leaders of the various Islamic
                    movements around the world. Most fundamentalist Muslims are not terrorists.
                    There's a lot that could be done and the possibilities exist to show them that
                    the United States is not the cartoon image which many of them believe. But it=s
                    all a matter of resources at this point and there is simply not the level of
                    commitment and urgency which the communist threat evoked during the Cold
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the leadership of USIA during
                        thithree years you were back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I have perhaps hinted earlier a certain degree of
                    disillusionment with the leadership of USIA. I don't think in the Clinton
                    Administration that people at the top of the agency were really strongly
                    committed to what we did. It reflected the broader distance and disdain which I
                    think colored the Administration=s overall attitude toward the Agency. Both the
                    director and deputy director certainly did not communicate very effectively a
                    strong sense of commitment to what USIA did and their somewhat remote leadership
                    style implicitly seemed to communicate that they really didn't care or didn't
                    know about what was being done. And, the Agency=s leadership nullified a major
                    internal reorganizational effort, which they initially urged, in order to show
                    how the Agency was reforming and becoming more efficient. The effort, which I
                    personally led, involved dozens of people from management, the unions, and all
                    levels of the staff to craft together a better way of doing business and
                    demonstrate that foreign affairs agencies could adapt and change. But the Agency
                    leadership, incredibly, at the eleventh hour killed the plan. It did not inspire
                    confidence in the future of USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, the director was Joseph Duffey, a long-time friend of the
                    President and the First Lady. Both the Clintons in fact worked in Duffey=s
                    unsuccessful Senate campaign in the early 1970s and the close relationship has
                    continued since that time. As much as I respect Director Duffey as a man of
                    intellect and a gentleman, I believe that perhaps he himself was ambivalent
                    about the Agency and its Cold War roots. And, his failure to make a strong case
                    for USIA in the administration, in contrast to what the USAID leadership
                    accomplished, is a principal reason that USIA was eliminated and merged into the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Senator Jesse Helms has been behind one of the
                        pushes. Diyou find him an important figure in USIA during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: One thing that really baffles me about the whole foreign affairs
                    integration process was that Senator Helms and other conservative Republicans
                    really wanted to target USAID, which was by definition anathema to them
                    ideologically. We clearly got the signal that they were after USAID. Senator
                    Helms and other Republicans, I had the sense, were basically favorable toward
                    USIA. But Helms insisted that one of the major foreign affairs agencies should
                    be integrated into the Department. It was the Administration's decision, not
                    that of Jesse Helms, to have merge USIA with State while USAID remained with its
                    separate identity and structure. That was, again, a decision made by the
                    administration itself, which reinforces my sense about an ideological rejection
                    of the Agency=s historical mission and function. Regrettably, no one on the Hill
                    was ready to challenge the Administration=s decision and defend the Agency. It
                    was not something with much of a domestic constituency. And, in the end there
                    was at least the pretense of foreign affairs reform and budgetary savings.</p>
                <p>Initially, the Administration had in fact resisted any form of tinkering with the
                    foreign affairs structure and opposed any type of foreign affairs consolidation.
                    A new megaagency, as the President, Vice President, and Secretary of State
                    repeatedly said, was contrary to all the principles of modern management and
                    would not really be more efficient. But the Administration turned around
                    completely and then moved with its own plan to eliminate USIA, their least
                    popular foreign affairs agency. I'm not so certain that in the end this is going
                    to make things either more efficient or more effective, particularly from the
                    standpoint of public diplomacy, but again, only time will tell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you left in '97, and just sort of to fill in,
                        whahave you been doing since?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>PENDERGRAST: Well, I've been doing a number of independent projects and at least
                    for now have deliberately avoided full-time employment so that I could enjoy,
                    after 32 years, the opportunity to travel and do things that I've always wanted
                    to do and never had the time to do, including some writing projects. I got
                    involved again with the North American connection I had developed during my
                    Ottawa period working on a report about the emerging North American higher
                    education cooperation after NAFTA. This was something, in fact, in Ottawa that I
                    very actively promoted, a sort oNorth American education track to the free-trade
                    area. We have developed and generated an increasingly vast network of trilateral
                    connections in the higher education field. And, I=ve done some pro bono work for
                    the Public Diplomacy Foundation, which seeks to advance public diplomacy-type
                    programs both professionally and as an academic discipline. The challenge is
                    daunting for all of the reasons I=ve mentioned. In a world where there is the
                    seductive appearance of intimacy and familiarity, what has been called the
                    global village, public diplomacy really means today for many people little more
                    than mobilizing domestic support for policies, which I think is a powerful
                    impulse inside the Department. Today we mislead ourselves if we confuse our
                    political, military, and economic power with truly understanding what is
                    happening in the world or with how people view us. Despite all of the
                    technological change and advances over the last decade, I really feel that
                    international understanding and competence in the United States have declined.
                    And, the risk for the future of our children and grandchildren is very real.
                    Public diplomacy has a central role in helping to define and deal with that
                    future, but I still do not see any real commitment either inside or outside the
                    government.</p>
