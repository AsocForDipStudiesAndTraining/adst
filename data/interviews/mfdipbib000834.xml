                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, what got you into the consular business as a career,
                        rather than just an assignment along the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Stu, that's a very easy question to answer. The same thing that did you,
                    perhaps; that's a fellow by the name of Loren Lawrence. He, you and I worked
                    together in personnel some 20 years ago, and he came on board in PER as a far
                    more experienced consular officer than I was. I had been in the Foreign Service
                    maybe ten years and done all kinds of things. Those were back in the days when
                    we didn't have “cones”, as we now call them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what a cone is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It's a strange word that came from somewhere. I'm not sure what were its
                    origins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's a management term.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It's indeed a management term. But I do know what it means practically:
                    and it's our functional specialty. In the Foreign Service, when you and I
                    joined, we came in as Foreign Service officers. We didn't know where we were
                    going to serve, and we didn't particularly care, except that we knew it probably
                    would be an interesting career. Maybe we might even make it to the top, although
                    there were no guarantees. But the route that we went wasn't very clear, and I as
                    you had all kinds of assignments. I was a staff aide in Paris, I was a consular
                    officer in a two-officer post in Birmingham, England, where you did everything,
                    especially because the boss was “retired in place”. We built a new consulate
                    building and then but a few years later it closed. I was in Moscow as a
                    publications procurement officer and as a political officer. I was then on the
                    Soviet desk, and then to Personnel. So I had no conal identity, nor did the
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been 1966?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MORGAN: 1966 to '68 is when I was in PER. Then the managers, for whatever reason,
                    decided that in order better to program the resources of the Foreign Service and
                    to react more responsively to its needs, we'd better identify ourselves by
                    specialty. So they came up with the four cones: political, economic,
                    administrative and consular. While in Soviet affairs, my personnel “guru” Morris
                    Draper said, “Why don't you come to Personnel? I think you need a little
                    diversified experience. I think you've had enough time with Soviet affairs.”
                    That sounded all right to me.</p>
                <p>I was put into a unit that turned out eventually to be the political cone, and
                    then I was asked would I take over the consular cone, as well, because the
                    incumbent was retiring. I said, “Sure.” And that job as well as political for
                    about six months. Then Lorie Lawrence came on board and he took over as the new
                    head of the consular cone in PER. That's a long answer to a short question, but
                    then we are supposed to be talking “history”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it as a regular FSO, having done a variety of
                        assignments, how did you view the consular service in the mid-1960s, as a
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Particularly because of Lorie's inspiration, I saw it as a challenging
                    function. I saw it as one that had been filled with technicians and was
                    generally avoided by the Foreign Service officer generalists because it was
                    highly technical and not looked at with much of a feeling of professionalism.
                    But Lorie came from the senior job in Tel Aviv, and saw the need to revamp the
                    function. And there were others; it wasn't just him, obviously. The demands on
                    the consular function were increasing in areas of arrested Americans and drugs
                    as well the changing and growing visa situation. The technician, the clerk, if
                    you will, that had been, in large part, responsible for running the consular
                    function, no longer could or should manage consular work. So it was time to give
                    serious thought to changing the staffing and leadership. It was also realized by
                    the system as a whole that the way we had been going was not going to work.</p>
                <p>So, some major decisions were made far above my head, and I was not really
                    cognizant of what they were until after the fact. Basically, it was decided
                    that, “There will be no more staff corps.” The clerk/technician can be
                    translated into the word “staff corps,” and the staff corps was declared
                    finished as a means of staffing the consular function. Henceforth, all consular
                    positions would be filled by Foreign Service officers. That was a major decision
                    and was coincidental with the establishment of the cone system. So people were
                    told, “Look, you will either leave the staff corps within a reasonable length of
                    time and come in through a lateral entry system into the Foreign Service officer
                    corps and compete as a Foreign Service officer, or you will retire.” Lorie
                    Lawrence used to say, “This will take us probably 20 years before its
                    accomplished.” And that is what happened. We have a consular function with no
                    staff corps. But there are always voices saying: “Let's bring back the Staff
                    Corps — or something like it — and save the poor FSOs from such onerous
                    technical work.”</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the officers who represented what in those days
                        was termed the substantive functions, economic and political functions, and
                        who pretty much were considered the upper crust of the Foreign Service, how
                        did they view the changing of the consular function from that of technicians
                        to actually drawing on regular officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I think anywhere from not accepting it, rejecting it out of hand, to
                    ignoring it or thinking that it really wasn't relevant. It was certainly not
                    universally acceptable as a management decision. The only exception to that—and
                    I'm glossing over here—were those people who were not successful competitors as
                    economic or political officers. Those unsuccessful could try to compete in this
                    new approach to the consular function. Such movement was seen by some as: “
                    they'll succeed, because anyone can do consular work.” The administrative
                    function was going through a comparable identity problem. But it wasn't as
                    draconian a change as in the consular function since the staff corps still
                    existed and made up a large part of the Admin cone. Admin types found themselves
                    also looking at the consular function, but in positive terms: a working
                    environment in which they could truly test their management skills. Many had
                    come into the administrative function to be managers, and they discovered they
                    weren't managing or they weren't in positions that encouraged such skills.
                    Whereas, if they switched to the consular function, they indeed could manage, in
                    the sense that their academic training and perhaps their own experience
                    permitted them to. They had people to supervise — lots of people —and they had
                    physical establishments that needed and welcomed their expertise more than
                    seemed apparent in the administrative function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first major consular assignment was as consul general
                        to Beirut in Lebanon in 1968. You stayed there for five years. How did you
                        view this position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, again, the short answer is Lorie Lawrence. He talked me into going
                    to Beirut. I was supposed to go to Haiti as chief of the political section. I
                    was trying to sell one of my clients, a political officer, to him to go to
                    Beirut. He said, “No, no. You've convinced me completely. You're the one that
                    should go to Beirut.” And I said, “Fine.” I had no problems with it. It
                    certainly sounded interesting, but most importantly, because I had learned more
                    about the new strengths, the new opportunities in the consular function. Also,
                    Beirut, in those days, sounded like (and was) a wonderful place. Finally, one of
                    my former bosses in PER, Bob Houghton, was going to go out as DCM, my boss, and
                    that certainly sounded good. Additionally, the job called for somebody who could
                    speak French. The answer to your question is: I really looked forward to it. It
                    looked like a lot of fun. I was also 20 years younger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your principal tasks as the consul general?
                        Would you describe the section and what you felt that you, as the consul
                        general, could contribute?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I've got to amend part of your question: I was not consul general and
                    could not be, for interesting reasons. The DCM had to bear the title of consul
                    general, because somewhere back in Washington, they had worked out this
                    arrangement that should Lebanon fall apart, God forbid, and someone stay there
                    as a representative of our nation, because of severed diplomatic relations, the
                    consul general could stay on and maintain consular relations. Obviously, it
                    couldn't be the chief of the consular section, because he couldn't handle such a
                    thing; it would be the DCM. So the DCM bore the “secret”, if you will, or at
                    least not-well-advertised title of consul general. I was a consul, chief of the
                    consular section. That's an aside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's also important, in that in the late Sixties,
                        even, the title of consul general was passed out very sparingly, no matter
                        how large the section.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, and in this case, because of its political relevance. In other
                    words, there are places in the world where you can maintain a consular
                    relationship with a country, or at least a lower than full diplomatic
                    relationship. I don't know if that exists today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happened, I believe, in Cambodia at one point, just
                        about that time, and I think everyone was very concerned about it. As chief
                        of the consular section, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The overriding job was protection and welfare work, even in those days,
                    in '68 when I arrived. Although it was relatively peaceful, there were certainly
                    enough problems around, hangovers from the '67 War. We had a large American
                    community, and it still remembered well the '67 evacuation which, to many, was
                    not well done. The embassy was seen by some as not supportive, and the
                    evacuation wasn't well-programmed. That huge American community consisted of
                    Lebanese Americans, academics, religious, wives of Lebanese, but largely
                    business people, because that was then the Paris of the Middle East. The
                    American business community was very, very strong — and happy to be there!
                    Coincidental with my arrival — someone accused me of causing it — was the
                    increase in the drug arrests, mostly hashish, and the serious growing problem
                    with drug use. So that whole area of protection of Americans was an enormous
                    part of the job, and was growing. In the five years I was there, drugs were
                    progressively more and more the name of the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The other part of the assignment, of course, related to the ever-present visa
                    issues that face most posts, but certainly were enormous in a country like
                    Lebanon. All aspects of the visa function were involved: heavy volume, fraud, a
                    feeling in most Lebanese' minds, sort of like the Filipino, that the United
                    States owes a visa to all Lebanese because of this special, this historical
                    relationship. Any Lebanese that wants to go to the United States should be able
                    to go. The fact that they had to provide a document that some silly vice consul
                    asks for, and they don't happen to have it, won't get in the way. They can
                    simply go out and get it, sure, from their local pastor or whomever, the
                    mukhtar, will provide it for them (for free?). This whole question of getting to
                    the United States — or as many of them put it to me, having a green card in
                    their pocket for security reasons — was something the U.S. owed Lebanese,
                    especially Christians. The fact that there were a series of rules, regulations,
                    criteria was irrelevant to a Lebanese, like to many Middle Easterners. Such
                    impediments are there because some silly bureaucrat put them there, and they're
                    there to be gotten around. It isn't a matter of breaking laws or anything; it's
                    just that's the way it's done in the real world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to talk about some of these functions, but first
                        let's go to the section. How well was it staffed? I'm really thinking more
                        about the officers there. Was it a problem dealing with the officers in this
                        type of work? How good were the officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: A gross answer to your question is, no, it was not a problem. Five years
                    there, looking back over that period, the pluses were far greater than the
                    minuses, I think, in part because people that were assigned to Beirut were
                    assigned, perhaps, with a degree of caution by the central establishment. It
                    wasn't like an assignment to, say, Canada or to Europe, where perhaps less
                    strong officers are sent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to digress for a minute, you and I both worked in
                        personnel, and know that problem cases, personality, drinking, other types
                        of problem cases, are sent to either close to the United States or to the
                        larger . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Places where they can be buried, “assimilated”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And one time I remember hearing that London had
                        accumulated more than its share of problem cases.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I can prove that, if you'd like me to. But yes, we had problems in
                    Beirut. We had a problem with drinking, we had problems with competence levels.
                    As a whole, however, the officers who came to Beirut were good, and I would
                    answer the question by saying not only did I think there was a degree of
                    sensitivity in assignments, but I think the place brought people together. I
                    mean, the excitement, the professional challenge, the integrated aspect of the
                    mission. I will brag that I refused to look, from that assignment on, at the
                    consular function as anything other than absolutely equal to all the other
                    functions. I felt, as the leader of the consular section, my job was primarily
                    to make sure everybody understood that. And if they didn't, then they were going
                    to hear exactly why it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about that. As specifically as you can, how did
                        you deal with the rest of the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: On various levels. There was the section chief to section chief
                    relationship, the country team meetings, sessions with the DCM, with the
                    ambassador, all that institutional intercourse that goes on in a Mission. That
                    was a normal way to sell your section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You felt that there was a selling job to be done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Oh, absolutely. From day one to the last day, and through the rest of my
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm with you, but I'd like to get this down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It won't sell itself. As a matter of fact, it will go the opposite
                    direction if all consular officers are not conscious of this necessity. You've
                    got to get out and sell your section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Far more than many of the other sections.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I think some of the others failed to sell their sections. I think they
                    could have afforded to and it was needed in explaining the section's work and
                    responsibilities to the whole Mission. I think USIA is very good at projecting
                    its image. It knows, as an often maligned and misunderstood function, that it's
                    got to speak up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by selling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Making clear that all your colleagues — often it's the ambassador that's
                    the least of the problems — know what the consular section does and how all
                    aspects of its work relate to Mission objectives. Junior officers often need to
                    learn the most about the importance of consular work. There's nothing worse than
                    an uninformed, self-impressed FSO-6 in the political section. They are the least
                    understanding, the least wise, probably, because of lack of experience and
                    immaturity. But how do you show that each segment of the embassy is affected by
                    events in the consular section? In Lebanon, it was very easy. For example,
                    everyone's got a visa client on their back. The intervention in Lebanon is
                    probably one of the strongest in the world. I know of other countries where
                    intervention is important but there is not a person that works for the Beirut
                    embassy, on the FSN or on the officer level, that isn't attacked—you can use
                    whatever verb you want—by local contacts all the time. They've got a cousin that
                    needs a visa, and is 100% bona fide. So therefore, a consular officer has
                    something that he can give them, or at least deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you deal with them on this type of thing? I'm
                        talking about within the embassy. Is it a give and take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, first of all, you deal with them professionally. In other words,
                    you don't become defensive. You give them a clear-cut, non-bureaucratic,
                    non-legalistic answer to whatever the question is. Keep smiling, keep laughing,
                    keep translating the particular question into their terms. Use diplomacy, I
                    guess, is the word. In other words, as a diplomat, you have to know how the
                    other person feels about something, what they're suffering, what their hangups
                    are, what the restrictions are. Put your own self into their position. Be
                    collegial, show how you have a common interest. Never, ever throw the book at
                    them; never say, “It's the law,” or, “That's the way it will be,” or, “No, I
                    won't,” or whatever. Just treat them as humans, and keep smiling.</p>
                <p>Of course, you see all your colleagues socially, you see them in many modes, so
                    that you've got the opportunity frequently to project your job. For example, we
                    shared a chalet down on the beach with the DCM and several American families
                    including one that was later a hostage, David Dodge. You're alone at the beach
                    and you discover yourself with the DCM's wife. Lois Houghton loved to hear
                    stories about our latest visa challenge or details on our newest arrested
                    American. That fed back to the DCM, but from a different perspective. In other
                    words, there is a general network of information flowing from the consular
                    section throughout the whole mission. Sometimes the stories were amusing,
                    sometimes they were sexy, sometimes they were very substantive. Often they were
                    stories related to the foreign policy issues of Lebanon and what it was going on
                    internally that affected the U.S. So I don't think it's very hard to sell the
                    consular function, especially at a post like Lebanon. But it was equally true in
                    Paris a few years later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that to be the head of a consular section,
                        it really requires diplomacy within the embassy, and the humor and using the

                        home to everybody else within the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Isn't that one of the strongest characteristics of consular work, that
                    it's human, that it's people-related? And if you don't know how to do it with
                    your own colleagues, then you've missed opportunity number one, because from
                    then on, you're defeated. You don't get your budgets, you don't get sympathy,
                    you don't get support you need. You've got to start with your post
                    associates.</p>

                        much a product of the Sixties, which was a “show me” period, a challenging
                        period, actually a fun period, I think, for most supervisors. Many of them
                        were only spending a relatively short time within the consular section
                        before they moved on to different functions on rotational things. How did
                        you sell the consular function to get them to work correctly, but also to
                        give them an appreciation for the consular function?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MORGAN: I think, picking up from the theme of collegial relationship with others,
                    first off it is essential to make clear that I expected them also to work
                    collegially with one and all. Maybe they couldn't sit down with the DCM's wife
                    in the same way I could, but I expected at whatever level of the embassy they
                    dealt with that they never should be defensive about what they were doing, and
                    never be bureaucratic. It's much easier for a vice consul to start talking about
                    the law, because they are so close to it and don't understand it necessarily as
                    philosophically or historically as we older ones. The vice consul really is
                    overwhelmed by all these legal and regulatory technicalities. “Don't get into
                    that kind of an answer with colleagues. Do the same thing I'm doing.” But more
                    important, perhaps, or parallel, letting JOs know by example what I'm doing.
                    Share with them on a daily basis, as they're working or formally at meetings or
                    whatever, everything that's going on. And maybe even telling some inside stories
                    about how I got the political counselor, Bob Oakley, and I really snookered him
                    last week by doing X, Y, and Z, or whatever. Make sure the JOs understand and
                    feel that they belong to a very important organization, and to a sub-tribe as
                    well, and let's have fun doing it. Let's get it out in the open, and let's be
                    demonstrably professional. That's the other part of the question, because they
                    were learning their new trade at the same time. I felt I must be on the visa
                    line — actually and in spirit — with them all the time. Equally important, you
                    must have your door open all the time. They must know the boss is with them.
                    Such things, I think, are but examples of how you can develop JOs. I think
                    you've really got to translate your open-doorness and your
                    on-the-line-with-themness into seeking at all times opportunities to discuss the
                    substance of what's going on, the substance of the visa decision, the substance
                    of the flow of people, the substance of the political problems in having the
                    congressmen on your back constantly over clients that are arrested and obviously
                    are good people and shouldn't be arrested because they're from Harvard or
                    whatever. All of the issues that can really mislead and discourage junior
                    officers, as they do senior officers, must be part of the training and
                    development process, both for their own morale and pride, but also so they'll
                    develop professionally. I never thought of JOs as rotational or “established”
                    consular officer by the cone they were placed in. As far as I was concerned,
                    they were junior officers learning some very important rules of diplomacy and
                    professional development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what I gather, you are saying, from your
                        experience—and I'd have to say from mine, too—that much of being a consul
                        general or chief of the section consists of getting out and talking to your
                        officers, sharing with them all the time. It's not a matter of sitting back
                        and every once in a while having a staff meeting, delegating authority and
                        all, but it's really explaining what's going on all the time. There's a lot
                        of officer-to-officer contact in this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. You've got to be yourself. I mean, if you're a little shyer than I
                    am or whatever is your own personality, you must be true to it. I can give you a
                    set of rules right now that I lived by, but they're my rules; they might not
                    apply to another person. But with that caveat, if you want to call it that, with
                    one's own stylistic approach, I think it is imperative never the less to show to
                    each and every officer, and FSN, naturally, that you understand and appreciate
                    what they're doing, and you're helping them to learn how to correct things if
                    they're not doing it right.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>My habit—and again, maybe someone else won't do that—was that a day seldom went
                    by in the last 20 years that I didn't find myself at every one's work station
                    for at least a few moments. I remember in Paris, Joe Cheevers, who was head of
                    the visa section; I think he thought I was trying to run his section. That's a
                    very difficult problem that you have. You've got to balance what kind of
                    relationship you have with subordinates, with a brand-new visa officer, with the
                    immediate supervisor. The supervisor in between you and the more junior person
                    might think, “Oh, what's he doing in there? He's usurping my authority,” or
                    something like that. The answer to that is very, very important: be certain to
                    tell that supervisor soonest everything you did with that subordinate. It's a
                    good opportunity to give him a quick analysis of how you think that junior
                    officer or FSN is doing or where you see some weaknesses. You can't take over
                    that middle manager's supervisory role. On the other hand, I think you don't
                    know what's going on, and you can't be “inspirational” or you can't perform the
                    leadership function properly unless you have that relationship. Yes, there are
                    other ways of doing that, such as by meetings, but there must be one-on-one
                    interplay. I must say I've used staff meetings many, many a time to get the
                    troops to vote for the things I really want, by having a democracy at work,
                    which is sharing and getting out certain issues. Then the next thing you know,
                    some vice consul's coming forward with the very thing you want them all to do.
                    And it is his or her idea! So yes, there isn't just a one-on-one thing with the
                    vice consul and going over a draft with him or a decision that he's made or how
                    you're about to convince him how he really should reverse his refusal. That's
                    part of it, but it's also the community of the section as a body politic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other factor that we haven't brought up. Could you
                        talk about dealing with a Foreign Service national? Obviously, particularly
                        in the consular function, there are key individuals who represent continuity
                        and often are not treated as well as they might by junior officers, who look
                        on them as mere clerks.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, mere clerks—they look on them as servants, and in some cases, they
                    look at them as worse than that, in the sense that they are often very
                    maltreated by vice consuls. That is one of the first lessons that you teach vice
                    consuls: how to work with FSNs. I wouldn't argue that you can't get along
                    without them; the Soviets have just proved that we can get along without them in
                    Moscow, I guess. But in any event, we have, as supervisors, a vital lesson to
                    teach officer relationship with FSNs. It's a social lesson, but it's also a
                    practical lesson. But beyond that, I think my experience over the years with
                    FSNs has been a mixed one, perhaps because FSNs can be such a varied group of
                    workers. You can have the most severe cases of poor professionalism,
                    incompetence. In Beirut, we used to call it the chauffeur syndrome: promoted to
                    get him out of the car pool. Where do you promote him? You promote him to the
                    consular section, because the consular chief always can be conned into taking
                    one more person. As a result you have a person brought into a section that they
                    shouldn't have been in the first place, and then kept there through this
                    marvelous thing called tenure. And you can't get rid of an incompetent if you
                    don't know how to. Then you have, unfortunately, some FSNs who have been around
                    too long and really aren't that effective any longer. I shouldn't start off with
                    a negative, but there is that aspect. It is a reality. Sections have some
                    plateaued FSNs that say, “We always did it this way,” or “We can't change,” or
                    whatever. And how you work with such folk has been an incredible challenge to
                    me.</p>
                <p>The other side of the question is perhaps even more demanding. You've got people
                    that are so bloody talented, are so wise, are so skilled, and in some cases,
                    many years in the function; they're just topnotch. They know how to work with
                    these constantly changing section chiefs and officers and so on. With these real
                    professionals you suffer favoritism, and that, believe me, as a section chief,
                    is perilous. How you make it clear that you don't favor somebody is an art, but
                    I think it's essential to master it.</p>
                <p>How do you take those extremes and those in the middle, too, and supervise
                    wisely? As section chief, show by example and demonstrate that all of the FSNs
                    are equal in terms of fair treatment. Skills are rewarded and incompetence
                    corrected or punished. It's not easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another question. I'm moving off to dealing with the
                        community at large, moving in gradual steps. How did you, as section chief,
                        make sure that the public was well served? I assume in Lebanon, when the
                        doors opened in the morning, you had a considerable number of people coming
                        in every day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's always a concern to make sure that the experience is
                        at least, if not pleasurable, at least it's not unpleasant.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MORGAN: The answer concerns both treatment of the American community as well as
                    the Lebanese community. How do you make the physical setup responsive to both
                    the clients coming in and to the staff, so it can perform effectively and
                    responsively? What we had when I arrived in Beirut was an extraordinarily bad
                    section lay out. It was an old apartment building, our embassy in Beirut, before
                    it was finally blown up. It was bombed seriously while I was there, but after I
                    left, they really had a go at it. How you redo an apartment house is not what
                    the managers in those days were skilled at. So we had an extraordinarily
                    inefficient operation, very bad security, poor people-flow, etc. And what it
                    did—I'm now singling out the American clientele because this is important to me,
                    how you, as section chief, balance the American community and the foreigners —
                    was show our most inefficient and bureaucratic side. The American community has
                    first preference, and you should receive the best and fastest service. They pay
                    your salary through their taxes, as any American will be quick to tell you if he
                    doesn't get the kind of service he wants.</p>
                <p>So how you assure (or create) a service-oriented, smooth-flowing layout for the
                    foreigners, largely Lebanese, visa applicants and notarials — and there were a
                    lot of notarial services — and for Americans as well — was an overwhelming
                    challenge. I'll quickly say I was incompetent to solve it but the space problem
                    was mastered by the administrative counselor, Vic Dikeos. He knew that the only
                    way to do it was by a massive restructuring. I kept saying, “Well, we don't have
                    the money,” blah, blah, blah, blah. I was clearly a typical small-thinking
                    bureaucrat. He said, “I'll take care of the money, and I'll take care of the GSO
                    labor. All I want out of you is to tell me how this place can run better.” And
                    fortunately, at the end of my first year, we completely destroyed the existing
                    inefficient consular section and, through his leadership and supply of funds and
                    encouragement, we restructured it. I guess my point is, you need others to help
                    you. You not only need them because they have the money, but you also need them
                    because they have the know-how and they've got the encouragement you need to
                    succeed.</p>
                <p>Lesson number one: get to know your admin counselor. Know him well and use him!
                    But as a colleague who is working on the same team as you are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Put him on your side.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. I didn't realize he was ahead of me. There aren't many out there
                    that are ahead of you in support of the consular section but I have,
                    fortunately, run into a few of them that are. I can't stress enough, and you
                    know, like many of my colleagues over the last 20 years do, how important I
                    think physical setup is. If the consular chief does not know how to plan and try
                    and figure out what the flow of the people is and how it varies with the time of
                    the day and the changing patterns of work load demands, he's not performing his
                    function as a manager. So that's my first response to you of how do you react to
                    the people-flow. The second one is the actual physical layout, restructuring
                    where necessary. Of course, fortunately, in the 20 years, we've gone a long way
                    on this aspect of a strong consular section. I have witnessed monumental changes
                    in physical layout planning, which makes both the working conditions better and
                    the professional staff reactions to the clients much, much better. It's for
                    those reasons that we improve people-flow and physical layout, not to make it
                    prettier or improve morale: those follow.</p>
                <p>Related to that, of course, is how do you provide a faster and more efficient
                    service? How do you take 500 visa applicants coming at you and figure out how to
                    move quickly those who don't need careful screening versus how do you slow down
                    and process more attentively — spend your officer and FSN time more effectively
                    — those that need more scrutiny? Same with the Americans or with the non-visa
                    function, for example, the notarials. How do you have a place that is targeted
                    for those people, so they know they're not going to be all mixed up with visa
                    applicants in the waiting areas? How do you keep the minimum number of people in
                    the waiting area? Flow the people through, get them serviced more quickly, and
                    thereby, I think, do a more professional job? And how do you sort out those that
                    really need the time? When the mother of the prisoner arrives, how do you make
                    sure she isn't caught up in the visa line? Whatever you want to call all that
                    bag of logistical management questions — the reaction to the crowds — the issue
                    is the heart of the management of the consular section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on now to dealing with the American community.
                        You were saying they wanted support from the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MORGAN: They wanted leadership. They, I'm pleased to say, are not like some other
                    Americans abroad: opposed to the American Embassy, opposed to the U.S.
                    government role. I guess they knew in Lebanon that the American Government was
                    thoroughly sensitive to Middle East issues. We have been accused, those of us
                    who served in Arab countries, of being tilted. But I think it was very clear to
                    all people that Embassy Beirut understood what the problems were, and we
                    understood the concerns of American business, academic and general community.For
                    example, the American school. I was on the board of the American Community
                    School, a very important, very, very good school. Most consular officers do find
                    themselves on such boards. But here we had, through the five-year period, a real
                    identifiable security questions. Security from a hashish trafficking and use
                    standpoint, security from an evacuation standpoint, security from a
                    life-threatening standpoint. It was in the late Sixties and early Seventies,
                    when children were less self-disciplined than they were before and are now. So
                    you had all these security issues in a very lovely and free-wheeling place. The
                    kids could go skiing in the morning and go to the beach in the afternoon. Who
                    wants to go to school or avoid hashish dealers? So the role of the chief of the
                    consular section in that part of the community was demonstrably center stage. I
                    look back proudly to many a story concerning the principal or teachers or
                    parents of how they could call Bill Morgan or call the American Embassy, and get
                    a straightforward, helpful answer, and they got it right away. “Can we go to
                    Damascus today?” Fine. “He told me no, and boy, we don't go.” I mean, that a
                    real support relationship.</p>
                <p>And this same responsibility of consular support concerns equally the business
                    community. There, of course, it was the entire embassy. The school was more
                    oriented towards the USIA operation and the consular function, but when you deal
                    with the business community, it was all across the board. The political section,
                    the economic and commercial section, and so on. And that relationship, from the
                    consular standpoint, was absolutely vital. There, of course, with the business
                    side, it was citizenship services, notarials. Also, general advise proffered.
                    You met these people socially, and you proved to them that you were not only a
                    fellow American, but you were professionally qualified. As the security and
                    political troubles got worse and worse, it was vital that you conveyed the right
                    degree of caution. You don't send out letters saying, “Today thou shalt not do
                    the following.” No, you can't do that. The E&amp;E plan — the evacuation plan —
                    in 1967, was implemented when we evacuated Americans. But it wasn't as
                    successful as some thought it should be. That was one of the consular section's
                    primary functions. How does it work? Well, an evacuation starts with knowledge
                    of the number of Americans present in the country. Did the Americans register at
                    the embassy? Not all. Did anybody tell them they had to? No. Did anybody
                    encourage them? It's not like the British, where you must, otherwise you might
                    lose your nationality.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So, shortly after I arrived I started a two- to three-year campaign to convince
                    everyone that it was in their interest to register. We established a system in
                    which all of the wardens, these individual embassy officers assigned
                    responsibility for different parts of Lebanon, became more and more involved
                    with their particular areas. We set up a mailing-address system, which was the
                    basis for letters to registered Americans. I started, for the first time, a
                    “Dear Fellow American,” letter. This way all Americans got, every couple of
                    months, for example at Christmas, a letter, but it also carried a message, a
                    sense of relationship with the embassy, a sense of “someone does care.” It also
                    gave me an opportunity to do two things: first, flow information out to the
                    American community, tell them, as things got worse, “Maybe you might want to
                    send your mother-in-law home now,” or “Maybe you better think about such
                    things.” But very carefully worded. Secondly, it provided the embassy with a
                    refined evacuation listing. For example, I would get a telephone call, “Bill, I
                    didn't get your letter.”</p>
                <p>“Well, are you registered?”</p>
                <p>“I don't know. I told my wife to register. Didn't she do it?”</p>
                <p>“Well, I don't know. Let me go look. No, you're not registered with us.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, well, I'll be in there tomorrow and register.” As a result, we went from
                    something like a 25% registry to 95%. So, after my departure in '73, in later
                    evacuations we knew who was there. We knew how to contact them better. Just one
                    example of how important it is to establish a relationship with the community
                    particularly in a troubled area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, let's move to some of the problems. Could you talk
                        about how you dealt there with the drug problem? Any specific cases of both
                        using your officers and your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, I think this five-year period in Lebanon is historic because it not
                    only was the real beginning of the drug issue on an international scale, but
                    also it was in a country where the absolute finest hashish in the world was
                    grown. Of course, the competition among world-wide dealers was tremendous. It
                    affected us as consular officers, as an embassy, watching the drug tragedy just
                    explode. I remember when I first arrived there, we had one prisoner, and he was
                    a merchant sailor who had been on a ship in Naples, I think it was, and came
                    down to Beirut for a nice weekend, and he got arrested for robbery. He'd got
                    involved in some drunken brawl and robbery. That was my prisoner.</p>
                <p>When I left, five years later, the average count was 25 prisoners, 100% of them
                    drugs, and maybe 25% were females, and 50% to 75% were university graduates, all
                    those “nice, young people” that weren't supposed to be involved in this sort of
                    thing, obviously caught in situations where they were totally “innocent”.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Caught in situations totally innocent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: At the airport, coming in on the way to somewhere, and they had a
                    suitcase with a false bottom, and they didn't know that Joe, back in New York,
                    had loaded the bottom part of the suitcase with all this stuff. Or leaving the
                    country with hashish in great quantities. You know, kids! The local American
                    minister's son and a dozen others picked up by the police and taken off to jail.
                    I got a call at 11:00 o'clock at night during a dinner party I was giving, from
                    the minister, saying, “My son is arrested, and he's off in jail.” That's another
                    part of the problem in Lebanon. It wasn't only the magnitude and the growth and
                    sadness of it all, but it was the conditions. I mean, jails were horrible. The
                    Sands prison was a Turkish 500-year-old prison that you wouldn't believe. I can
                    still hear the words, “Konsul hon.” It means, “The consul's here,” as I would
                    arrive at the prison, and the guard would scream out across the entrance area,
                    “Watch out. Here comes the American consul!” And I did go, indeed. You talk
                    about relations with the vice consuls and junior officers, yes, I had one
                    officer and then two officers that did nothing but protection and welfare work.
                    You bet your life I got involved, you know, not just to set an example or
                    whatever, but because I got a telephone call, and you couldn't very well say,
                    “All right, fine,” especially to the Reverend or a friend, that you're sending
                    your vice consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you deal with these cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, you dealt with them the way, of course, we're all told to deal with
                    them. You react instantly, and if you don't hear about it relatively instantly,
                    you let police or the Lebanese attorney general know. They were quite good about
                    this. Then you charge off, or whoever gets the call, to jail. Unfortunately,
                    sometimes you learn first from the newspapers or the grapevine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went, or was it usually another officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Usually another officer. Well, in the beginning, when I first went there,
                    when it wasn't a major problem, I found myself more involved. But when it got
                    into three or four arrests a week or more, like the student bunch, I think there
                    were 18 kids that were arrested in one fell swoop, it was more and more the
                    chief of the American protection unit and/or one of the vice consuls; often the
                    duty officer. I don't know why, but I guess it seems always these things take
                    place off hours. You are called, usually, at 10:00 o'clock at night or during
                    cocktails or something like that, and you have to react right away.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>You take along your “welcome kit”, which we all had in our homes, to the jail or
                    to the airport or wherever. What you did, of course, first and foremost, was to
                    make sure that the individual saw both your ability and your limitations.
                    Ability, in the sense that you were a fellow American and you could make clear
                    that,”I sympathize with you, and I'm sorry you got yourself into this trouble.
                    I'm not making any judgment. Don't ask me to make any. I'm not a judge, and I'm
                    not going to play that role, and I can't get you out of jail, but I can do some
                    things for you.” Then you proceed through what you could do. I guess mostly it's
                    a cathartic relief to a person who is in a terribly emotional state. How can
                    you, as a fellow American, get the person to calm down if they are excited, and
                    specifically face the realities of the arrest that they're in the middle of? And
                    you don't immediately say that your crime could get you 30 years in jail or even
                    execution, but you make sure they realize that they've got some pretty heavy
                    things ahead of them. Then you take out the famous list of lawyers, and you tell
                    them that they need some legal advice, and you can't give it, other than you can
                    tell them something about the legal system. Of course, you do. And you don't say
                    all the things you might like to say or know, because that isn't the setting.
                    But you do want them to realize, because they'll hear it other ways, and that is
                    that there are ways of buying themselves through this particular situation or
                    paying off the lawyer, the police or the judge, and discovering that it doesn't
                    work or that isn't the way you do business or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a problem that I think all of us have faced in
                        certain countries. An American is in trouble. You know that the system is
                        such that often the best way to get out of it is a payoff of some kind, and
                        this is how the system work, to a certain extent. Yet you are doing a great
                        disservice to the American if you take a holier-than-thou attitude and say,
                        “Well, we don't accept payoffs,” because then they end up in jail in a very
                        difficult situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how do you deal with that particular problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Based on my experience, in Lebanon at least, the problem was relatively
                    easy, because my officers and I could say to anybody, “I know of no example
                    where a person paid off and succeeded, and I know of lots of examples where they
                    gouged them and they got nothing. Now, I'm not saying it doesn't exist. I'm just
                    merely saying from my own experience, the chances are you will pay and you will
                    get nothing for it. But that's your decision. If you have a lawyer that tells
                    you he can pay off the judge, think very carefully. I can't say it isn't
                    possible. I can't say it isn't actually not possible in the United States. It
                    doesn't usually work, but you are only going to be able to face that yourself.
                    All I can say to you, as your consular officer, is think very carefully about
                    this. You will hear as I have heard of lots of stories of corruption here. I
                    would say more important than corruption in this country is greed, the 'buck',
                    the Lebanese pound, or whatever. They are very enterprising business people
                    here, and they have dealt with it thousands of years and longer than you have.
                    Go very carefully. Also, listen very carefully to what the judge is saying and
                    what the authorities are saying. Many of them are quite honest, and you're going
                    to have to live with yourself through this.”</p>
                <p>Stu, the real answer to the question was a “Lebanese solution”, We had,
                    fortunately, a Lebanese government, which included Armenians. The government's
                    chief psychiatrist, I don't think that's what he was called, but that's what he
                    was, was an Armenian by the name of Manougian. He ran a mental hospital just
                    outside of Beirut which included a very, relatively speaking compared to the
                    other prisons of Lebanon, tolerably pleasant drug detention center. And what he
                    did was work out with me—and I use the word “work out,” that's too strong for
                    it—a “solution” for American prisoners. He thought it was wrong that Americans
                    and Europeans, given their cultural, historical background, should be exposed to
                    some of the criminals that were in the Sands prison and even in the women's
                    prison. He established, with the Lebanese authorities and the attorney general,
                    that the act of drug use was a psychotic act and that those so convicted should
                    be detained in his mental facility. The act of smuggling drugs wasn't. But if he
                    could be convinced (by a “good” Lebanese lawyer) that the person who was
                    smuggling drugs, in fact, used drugs — fessed up to their use of drugs — then
                    they would be transferred, eventually, based on “psychotic behavior”, to a far
                    more civilized setting. That was the answer in Lebanon to the arrest of many of
                    the American drug traffickers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might say that this was in its own way, almost exactly
                        the same time when I was in Greece, the way it worked with us, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: There were solutions. There are local solutions to this legal problem. A
                    person is caught and they go through a legal system, and the legal system of
                    that country is a variation of the legal system in our country. So there is
                    usually a varied form of punishment in various countries —different than the
                    American solution and therefor not understood by Americans arrested or the
                    next-of-kin.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of the great powers of the consul is the fact
                        that most foreign authorities don't want to have a lot of foreigners in
                        their jails. It's a bother and an expense to them, and so that often you can
                        use the local authorities to figure a way to eventually get them out of the
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: The Lebanese were caught in a quandary that other countries get caught
                    in, and that is they were pressed by the United States, in this case, in two
                    different directions. One is to stop the drug trafficking, stop the hashish
                    growth. We had an good-sized DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency] operation in Lebanon.
                    We put considerable pressure in our anti-drug efforts on the Lebanese
                    authorities, of which I was the Mission coordinator. I wore both hats. There's
                    always the question, can you wear both hats? Can you protect an American and at
                    the same time try to act as the coordinator against drugs in the country? The
                    answer to that is yes, you can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took just the reverse position in Greece at the same
                        time. I refused to wear both hats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, we could argue this, but we won't take up the time. The point being
                    that the Lebanese found themselves under this double pressure. So they wanted to
                    get rid of American prisoners. But at the same time, they had to have an
                    impeccable record of not being soft or duplicitous on drug traffickers. Other
                    countries were involved too, the Danes and the French and the British and other
                    Arabs were all being arrested for the same thing. So there had to be equitable
                    treatment, and the American sometime “suffered” from this equitable
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>When it went too far, whenever we found ourselves with the Lebanese
                    “misbehaving”, for example, if there wasn't proper notification of arrest, or we
                    felt that a judge really was being inequitable, or we had something—in all cases
                    it had to be something measurable — I would go to the attorney general, a very
                    important person in Lebanon. Sometimes I would go with the ambassador or DCM,
                    depending on the level of representation that we wished to bring. Here again,
                    there was always present a certain political reality. We haven't talked about
                    this, but as far as serving as a consular officer in Lebanon, there was never a
                    moment in anything I did that it wasn't “political” in nature. By that I mean
                    that not only the Lebanese situation but also because of the realities of the
                    Middle East there were dangers that related to consular problems and involved
                    Lebanese society.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Something we haven't talked about at all, that I found in my last couple of years
                    there involved protecting U.S. interests in Syria. We had no diplomatic
                    relations with Syria. In '67, they cut ties with the United States, and there
                    was no entry to that bordering country. I mean, no American was allowed into
                    Syria. Then in 1969 it began to open. The Syrians advised the Italians who
                    represented us that certain Americans might enter. I was one of the first
                    officials to go into Syria but only as the consul; this goes back to the role
                    you can play as a consular officer. Then came the apprehension of the military
                    attach� from Beirut. The Major was a student at the U.S. Army Middle East area
                    studies program there. He was caught taking photographs of strategic Mt. Hermon
                    on an open road on the way to Damascus. He was arrested, maltreated and was kept
                    for three or four months. This was not dealt with directly on a diplomatic
                    level, because we had no diplomatic relations but on a consular basis. The only
                    way the Syrians would permit negotiations to take place was through the Italians
                    and with me, as the consular officer. So that is an example of a very political
                    world in which a consular officer can find himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with this case, the military
                        attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: In ways that are traditional and ways that aren't. The traditional way is
                    through the Italian representative. Of course you found out all you could about
                    the charges against the attach�. But unfortunately, the good major in question
                    did himself in. He had an Official passport for his Beirut assignment which he
                    used initially to identify himself. When he saw the pressures coming, he pulled
                    out his other passport, Diplomatic, which showed him as the attach� in Amman,
                    Jordan, which, of course, he wasn't yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an Arabic language and area student.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, exactly. He had been assigned to Jordan, but he hadn't got there
                    yet. So he just did a whole series of extraordinarily contradictory and
                    suspicious things that if you're caught doing them, is bad enough. But if you're
                    by Syrian intelligence agents who are convinced that an American attach� is
                    obviously working not only for the Defense Department, but for the CIA and for
                    the Israeli Government and Lord knows for whom else. I mean, they have no
                    alternative but to throw the book at you.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>But back to your opening question. The first method of dealing with the Syrians
                    was through the normal traditional diplomatic route via the Italians. The other
                    was through the not-normal route. You dealt, as we know now too well as a result
                    of the hostage situations, with all kinds of factions in Lebanon. You contacted
                    the Shiites, the Christians, you dealt with the Druze, and with anyone on all
                    levels of authority. You had the help of the political section and at other
                    times you dealt with the contacts individually. I mean, there were occasions
                    when the Italian protector would come to Beirut, and we'd literally meet in a
                    park, because we knew that G-2 the Syrian intelligence authorities were an
                    extraordinarily enterprising group, and maybe had techniques better than the KGB
                    in some ways. At certain sensitive times you couldn't afford to use telephones
                    or even meet in each other's embassies. So you dealt in all sorts of ways. You
                    had to strike a deal with the Syrians, is what it amounted to, and a deal was
                    finally arranged. I went to the border where the Italian rep brought the
                    liberated Major to the Lebanese side. LeCarre stuff! He was all beaten up and
                    his teeth were knocked out. He was in bad condition. As a tangential consular
                    story, his mother had been with him in Beirut over the previous year. She was
                    frequently in my section, “What are you doing? What is the latest? Why don't you
                    get my son out?” This was of course understandable. She came the day after we
                    got him back. He was in the hospital, actually evacuated by an Army plane to
                    Weisbaden. She insisted on staying behind in Lebanon. She liked her digs there
                    and so on. She walked in and said, “I want you to arrange for my going to
                    Damascus as a tourist. I want to go to the Souks and do some shopping.” That's
                    right. One can't believe what people will do nor how a consular officer must
                    keep his cool at all times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just raised my eyebrows.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: You raised your eyebrows. (Laughter) I did more than that to her. I think
                    that's one of the times I might have lost my cool in my profession. (Laughter)
                    But what I'm trying to say here is—that you can take such an isolated, perhaps
                    dramatic and sexy story, but they occur repeatedly in our trade. The chief of
                    the consular section, be it in a country like Lebanon, or in most countries, are
                    frequently faced with issues which have real political and diplomatic aspects or
                    implications. How you negotiate with the government over all kinds of issues is
                    a daily job challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deals were being struck.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, deals are normal. I don't want to make them shady.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but I'm saying there is a negotiating process.</hi>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>MORGAN: You're a diplomat. You work for the Foreign Service. You are a part of
                    U.S.-X country relations, and the consular function isn't just adjudicating
                    visas, fending off or evaluating influence brought to bear on a visa issuance.
                    It's rather the flow of people, questions of brain drain.The French, for
                    example, used to enjoy discussing with me our visa processing, how our sections
                    were set up, how we handled refugees, how you allow French diplomats to work in
                    the U.S. So you've got a non-technical aspect of consular work that, to me, is
                    fundamental to the consular function. Call it political, call it managerial or
                    whatever you want. But it relates to a country-to-country relationship, at times
                    becoming sensitive, and certainly involving other elements of the embassy.</p>
                <p>Going back to your very opening question, it isn't hard to establish good
                    relationships in a Mission. These come naturally over issues of mutual concern.
                    All you have to do is prove yourself competent to deal with your colleague on a
                    basis of mutual interest and respect. In other words, understand what the
                    political implications are. If you don't, if you say, “That's political. I don't
                    understand it,” or “That's an economic issue,” or “That's a commercial issue,”
                    you've just sealed your fate. Then you are a technician. You might as well go
                    back “down” to your section and forget it. But in so doing you're not performing
                    your total job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, we'll pick up various themes as we go, but I want to
                        move on to some of your other assignments, the different aspects. You were
                        saying both the ability to get out of a problem and a sense of humor. Did
                        you find that you were looking for something different than some of your
                        colleagues who represented other functions were looking for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: In their own functions?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Well, other than those two qualities, and I think they are welcome
                    qualities in all the functions, there is a third. I'd like to think other
                    functions need it but in consular it's absolutely vital: the human relationship.
                    How do you like people? Do you enjoy taking on people's problems? One of our
                    favorite questions in BEX was: “candidate, you're in Cairo and there's this
                    person arrested down at the Sphinx. What will you do?” To me, the determinant in
                    the response was did the aspiring J.O. get up off his backside and go to try and
                    solve the problem, or did he sit there with the telephone and grope for it to go
                    away. In other words, are they avoiding human contact, a person-oriented
                    situation? Do they want to hide in their office? Or do they really look forward
                    to going out to the Sphinx? That, to me, was a vital job requirement.</p>

                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on after BEX to your next assignment, you were in
                        the Inspection Corps. This was something new, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes, it was brand-new. As a matter of fact, the job I wanted was Chief of
                    American Services. I wanted to replace Alan Gise, but good old Walyntinowicz,
                    who was then head of CA, said, “No, I have a greater opportunity for you. I want
                    you to be the first consular officer in S/IG,” which was then the acronym for
                    the Inspection Corps. I said, “What are you talking about? I'm not qualified to
                    be an inspector.” “Oh, yes, you are. You have the rank and you have the
                    experience. I worked vigorously against S/IG's biases and convinced them that
                    they needed a consular officer”. I must admit I had fun and it was a great
                    assignment. Because of my experience in Lebanon and other postings I was indeed
                    qualified. Also, I had a fine bunch of fellow-inspectors who appreciated my
                    efforts to teach them the real essence of the consular function. This was even
                    more satisfying, in a sense, because a report, an inspection, the end
                    result—Mexico, for example—is so consular oriented. You participate in the
                    inspection fully and work closely with your fellow inspectors, particularly the
                    senior inspector, and truly prove that the consular operations are fully
                    substantive and vital to the total Mission objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Using Mexico as an example, how did you show the substance
                        of consular work to both the other inspectors and even to the embassy
                        itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I guess the basic way of doing it is making it very clear that the
                    consular section and its work, which many colleagues would like to see as
                    “separate from” the real Mission, is, in fact, and essential and integral part.
                    For example, the visa crowds around the embassy: how John Jova, our very
                    qualified, distinguished ambassador in Mexico, reacted to this and other
                    consular issues. At the end of six weeks of inspection, in which the whole team
                    spent at least 50% of our time in the consular function, including in the
                    constituent posts, we sat down with the ambassador. “We went over with
                    interest,” the senior inspector told Jova, “the listing of the Mission's
                    objectives and issues. We see nothing here of the role of the consular
                    function.” “Well, that isn't substantive,” replied the Ambassador. Then the
                    Senior Inspector asked, “How much time do you spend on such things as prisoners
                    and the drug issue and visa intervention and management issues such as the
                    crowds around your embassy?” “Oh, I spend 60, 70% of my time.” And then the
                    obvious reaction: “Well, if you spend that much of your time, then clearly
                    consular issues are substantive.”</p>
                <p>The point is that too many people — even those well-intentioned — don't look at
                    consular as being a part of a Mission's fundamental objectives, and they are
                    indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're saying “people,” you're talking the
                        professional Foreign Service officer corps, those not engaged, although
                        every one of whom has probably served a time as a vice consul.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MORGAN: So many of our senior colleagues say: “My best days were back when I was
                    a vice consul; I just loved that assignment.” But it sounds so tendentious.
                    condescending. So many don't mean that in fact it was such an important learning
                    and interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you found yourself as a salesman both as a consular
                        officer, but also as an inspector, and also as an examiner, again going back
                        to the salesman idea, to explain to people how important not only this
                        function is, not because you're doing it, but it is such a vital part of
                        what the Foreign Service is about, but it's not recognized as such.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It's salesmanship in the sense that you're getting people informed and
                    you have a “product” that must be sold. But I'd like to raise it one level above
                    that definition.</p>
                <p>I remember Barbara Watson, God rest her soul, took the top of my head off once
                    when I said that I was “conning” my colleagues. I said, “Oh, no, Barbara, I
                    don't mean that as acting as a con artist; I mean it rather as gaining the
                    confidence of. In other words, getting people to look at you confidently and
                    seeing that what you're doing is in their interest, that you're not out there to
                    harm them or to compete with them or do damage, but, in fact, to help them. So
                    in that sense, we are salesmen ... and “con artists”.</p>
                <p>As inspectors, you're also selling consular work — you're gaining the confidence
                    of your fellow inspectors — so the team as a whole can do a better inspection
                    job. As an inspector, there's a constant exchange of information. The political
                    inspector, for example, is gathering information about the consular function
                    when he examines the political section. Over drinks and dinner in the evening or
                    in more formal meetings you share stories, facts and impressions to produce a
                    total evaluation of the mission. Now, as the consular inspector, of course, you
                    do more than inspect the consular section, you inspect generally other agencies.
                    I've evaluated DEA, USIA, INS, VA, etc. I've also examined complete posts as an
                    inspector. In reality you are a full, real team member. You're not an auditor
                    examines the books, as S/IG looked at the way to evaluate the consular function
                    when I joined them. Eventually, S/IG asked me to write up a series of guidelines
                    on how to inspect the consular function, to focus on real management issues. In
                    those days, we didn't know how to spell the word management, yet inspectors were
                    expected to examine the management of the post. In sum, I believe a solid
                    salesmanship was called for — toward fellow inspectors and to the total mission.
                    It was a tremendous experience. I so enjoyed it. I think now have three or four
                    consular-qualified inspectors as permanent slots in S/IG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our time is moving on, so I want to talk to you about the
                        time you were deputy director in the Visa Office. Could you tell me just
                        what was your prime function?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Trying to make sense out of the visa function, I guess. We had in the
                    field mostly junior officers facing difficult situations, trying to understand
                    the role of Congress of the United States which wrote a law and State which
                    produced a series of regulations. On the other hand, I had to manage a large
                    office, 104 folks, half of whom were civil service employees. Many of them were
                    lawyers and staff support people, certain of whom thought people in the field
                    were incompetents or just “don't understand laws or the realities of
                    Washington.” In the field were FSOs who ere on first tour, counting their days
                    until they could get out of consular work, or others who were there to learn our
                    trade. I guess that was my prime function: balancing these at times conflicting
                    forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has always been, I'd say probably more than almost
                        in any other function, a lack of communication between the field officer and
                        Washington. I speak as generally a field officer, managing the visa program
                        and having the feeling that in Washington, the visa office is continually
                        trying to second-guess your judgment, particularly to make sure that the
                        congressional people do get their way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. That's exactly the point. That's precisely what I faced: trying to
                    juggle these conflicting interests and attitudes. In fact, that was the fun of
                    the job, because I was accepted — I guess is the right word — by those people
                    who weren't from the field. In other words, the Dick Scullys and the Carl
                    Shepherds, those folks that were the permanent establishment. I'm convinced they
                    did not look at me as the enemy from the field, but rather, somebody who was
                    trying to find the balance between the legal and Congressional demands and the
                    “how do you do it under a hot sun and pressures of Kingston or Bujumbura?” That
                    was my job, to find a balance, and I enjoyed it very much. Again, we can go back
                    to some of the things we talked about before—gaining the confidence of
                    everybody, keeping a good sense of humor, knowing what everybody's doing,
                    getting around. I remember Julio Arias, who was then my boss as director of the
                    Visa Office. He wondered, “Why do you go around to these different offices?” I
                    explained to him something that wasn't completely the truth that I had too big a
                    pot belly, and I wanted to reduce it, and the only way I could do it was getting
                    actively around. His style was somewhat different. But I felt that in the job I
                    was in, sort of caught between, if you will, that I had to make sure every one
                    of those 104 people knew that I understood what they were doing and I was with
                    them as well as with the field officers.</p>
                <p>The other part of my job was the bigger one, namely finding ways to
                    institutionalize the reconciliation of differences by better communication. We
                    worked very, very hard on making sure the regulations were rewritten in real
                    English, that they were timely, that when they got out to the field they were
                    seen as a welcomed addition to the Bible.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Another communications devise we used was consular conferences. I started up a
                    system where the field came in responding to those specific questions. In other
                    words, the conferences avoided pontificating about this, that, or the other
                    thing, but rather were designed to discuss real problems. Also I emphasized the
                    importance of giving timely responses. I signed off on every cable that went to
                    the field. I made sure that the message answered the question and was not
                    pedantic, legalistic or insulting. There were certain folks in VO who enjoyed
                    putting down those in the field. Some of them didn't even realize what they were
                    doing or that their style of response was not comprehensive and useful in the
                    real-world end of the visa line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The cable that comes out saying, “As you should have
                        known.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Precisely. Not a cable went out like that when I was there, even though
                    there were a few I would have liked to have said that, because believe me, the
                    field often should have known better. Let me put it differently. I would say to
                    anyone who was writing a cable to the field, “I want you to write that response
                    to a junior officer in Kathmandu, and I want that first-tour junior officer to
                    understand every single thing you said in that message, no matter how complex it
                    is. And I want him to appreciate getting that response. And if he doesn't, then
                    you haven't done your job right.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on, I'd like to talk about congressional
                        influence and pressure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. We haven't talked about that. It's been out there in the shadows.
                    Like lawyers, congressmen are in reality our friends and supporters. It's how
                    you express your support for them that is vital to mutual understanding.
                    Congressmen, as far as I'm concerned, have been the greatest asset to the
                    Foreign Service. Many of my colleagues, I'm afraid, don't recognize their role
                    under the Constitution. They're looked at as the enemy. A consular officer who
                    looks at a congressman as an enemy is in deep trouble, because the congressman
                    not only has written most of the laws that define our work in the consular area,
                    but they're the ones that help us, even though they are the ones that send the
                    “congressionals”. Those are the famous “missiles” we're so frustrated to receive
                    and anxious to get rid of. I don't find congressionals so bad at all. As far as
                    I'm concerned, a congressional says one of two things, either the congressman
                    wants to get re-elected and needs his constituent's vote or he really thinks you
                    should reexamine what you did, Mr. Consul. Or both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A congressional, by the way, for the record, is a letter
                        from and to a congressman, replying to a query.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Right. Because the congressman's problem, as many a congressman has so
                    told me, is getting re-elected, and the way you do it is by getting people to
                    vote for you; i.e., constituent support. The second thing that a Congressional
                    does is underline that we perhaps are not reacting to a particular case the way
                    we should. If you are adjudicating or acting correctly, if you have given it
                    fair hearing and made your judgment correctly, you won't hear another peep out
                    of the congressman. All he wants is an answer that is sensible and that he can
                    send on to his constituent. But if you are doing something wrong—that's perhaps
                    too strong—but if it's something you could do differently or better, it brings
                    the problem to you and the immediate supervisor.</p>

                <p>MORGAN: It's a management tool.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: And you do it by starting off with the vice consul, asking, “I know
                    you're right, but could you fill me in?” In other words, don't let the
                    congressional be a bad thing. As a matter of fact, you can be very sympathetic
                    and curse out the congressional while establishing the facts.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The real thrust of your question was: how does Congress work with the Visa
                    Office. Tremendously well, with very few exceptions. I can broaden this beyond
                    just the Visa Office to prisoner problems or whatever. In most cases,
                    congressmen do not get up on a hobby horse or on a political cause when they're
                    dealt with honestly, frankly and professionally. Once in a while, you'll get a
                    congressman who gets taken away with his “cause”: I had one from California. We
                    had this female prisoner in Lebanon. But the intervening congressman just
                    couldn't get off the fact that this lovely young lady was in jail. In all due
                    respect to him, I'm not questioning his judgment, but I'm saying that he really
                    brought incredible pressure on us and challenged our professionalism. I must say
                    it kept our feet to the fire, though. But my bottom line was, “I'm not going to
                    treat her differently just because there's a congressman that has brought
                    particular pressure.” I feel that she has gotten the same treatment that all
                    other prisoners who didn't graduate from Stanford or don't have a congressman
                    behind them, then I'm satisfied we're acting correctly. This is a very important
                    message: Don't let the congressional cause you, as an officer, to tilt in a
                    judgment that would be inequitable to other prisoners or visa applicants. That's
                    easy to maintain, but it's true. I repeat, if you tell the congressman what the
                    problem is — I don't care whether it's refusing to let a South African into the
                    United States and you're responding to Jesse Helms or vice versa — give him the
                    answer, including that in some cases it's simply because the Secretary of State
                    — the Executive Branch that is — has so decided. You can pass the buck on truly
                    sensitive ones, because they do go to a higher level. Tell him what the facts
                    are. Usually it's a staff aide that's the problem. If you get the senator or the
                    congressman on the phone, it's no problem at all. First of all, he doesn't know
                    the facts too well, and secondly, he's very good at listening to you. Whereas
                    the staff aide is perhaps gone a little bit too far in committing the senator to
                    an action that in fact can't be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving off this subject to being consul general in Paris,
                        what was different there as a consul general than in Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Of course, the dangers of being blown up, for example, are reduced. You
                    were looking at a more civilized setting, so your living was easier, although
                    living in Paris isn't always the easiest thing in the world. But let me tick off
                    the similarities. First, getting to know your colleagues and working with them
                    well is identical to the Beirut, S/IG and VO situations. There was no difference
                    whatsoever in how you work with your colleagues, gain their confidence and
                    relate to the consular function. Secondly, we also had a physical relocation
                    problem in Paris that was basic and involved the entire embassy. On the other
                    hand, the visa function involved much less intercession; as a matter of fact,
                    next to nothing. So, visa pressures were less but the volume was far worse. We
                    were in Paris during the Iranian hostage crisis when our embassy was held
                    imprisoned. We had a tremendous influx of Iranians at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in Paris between 1978 and '81.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MORGAN: Right. Exactly. The visa responsibilities were largely a function of
                    volume and people movement logistics. The basis of our visa business was the
                    legitimate French and European applicants weighed against the third-country
                    nationals who were the problem cases, particularly Iranians. And the physical
                    layout lessons I learned from Beirut became applicable in Paris. We had to
                    relocate the section, and that was a battle far more difficult than in
                    Beirut.</p>
                <p>The similarities with the American community were there. The Americans weren't as
                    concerned about security issues, but they were very sensitive that the American
                    Embassy understood their concerns. I was on the board of the American Chamber of
                    Commerce and the American Hospital of Paris. I was vice-president of the
                    American Club of Paris, an organization that were very, very closely tied to
                    Embassy objectives. The Consul General was role-playing but that role was
                    clearly in U.S. interests in France and with the American community.</p>
                <p>The thing that's different—and I want to emphasize that most issues really were
                    the same as in Lebanon — was my role as supervising consul general over five
                    constituent posts. I would say that took up about a third of my time. These
                    constituent posts were constantly being closed or threatened to be closed. We
                    also had, in some cases, prima donnas as Principal Officers. In other cases, we
                    had not too qualified people. They were almost all two-officer posts. The small-
                    post-syndrome versus the big embassy, was endemic: “no one ever listens to me
                    and no one ever cares what I'm doing,” versus “they don't know what they're
                    doing out there in the consulates.” The role, as supervising consul general, as
                    well as guiding the consular function, was a ball-juggling but very fascinating
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the posts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Lyon, Bordeaux, Nice, Marseille, and Strasbourg. We closed Nice while I
                    was there, and then we reopened it. I think we closed it again. I can't
                    remember. But the issue: Can a consular cone officer supervise principal
                    officers who are economic or political cone? Yes, if he ranks them and writes
                    their efficiency reports. It's amazing what he can do. And second, if he gains
                    their confidence and says, “Look, I'm with you.” Traveling out to the
                    constituent posts repeatedly, sitting down with the admin and other FSNs,
                    commiserating with the principal officer and understanding where they feel
                    they're being misused or misunderstood. Security. I traveled repeatedly with the
                    Embassy security officer to these posts, because security in France was becoming
                    ever more important. Remember, we lost an assistant military attach� and almost
                    a DCM and Commercial Counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, you were talking about being the supervising consul
                        general in Paris. I'd like to move on to your last purely consular
                        assignment. You were consul general in Montreal. There it was quite a
                        different role. You had consular affairs, political reporting, economic
                        reporting, the whole works. Looking at it from a consular officer, how well
                        do you think you were trained to move into what we call a broader or more
                        diversified role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: I would argue that my training in the consular function was largely in
                    management areas and therefor prepared me for juggling the various demands as a
                    post program director. So the quick answer is yes, perfectly trained. I think
                    specifically, the experiences I had with S/IG, BEX, in Paris and Beirut and so
                    on, all, in one way or another, exposed me to the issues that I faced in
                    Montreal.</p>
                <p>But what I want to answer first is the question you haven't asked, and that is
                    how did I get the assignment. That, I think, is more relevant because I didn't
                    necessarily seek out Montreal. I was told that Montreal was going to go again to
                    a political officer, and that it was consular designated. I don't know if we
                    have designations any longer to principal officerships, but Barbara Watson got
                    that thing going a number of years ago. (Barbara was former Administrator, then
                    Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs for a goodly number of years under
                    Carter and before.) By designating certain principal officerships for the
                    consular function was the only way you could fight the system to get a consular
                    officer into a senior Consulate General slot. “Obviously a consular officer is
                    not substantively qualified to manage a post, because he isn't competent to deal
                    in political and economic matters”, was and is the bias consular officers must
                    face to attain top consulate general positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the framework of how the personnel system, run by
                        political officers and economic officers, felt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Yes. That's the way our system has worked and it probably always will. In
                    those early days, this was the only way you could possibly force the system to
                    assign a consular officer to a Program Direction job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1981 to 1985.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MORGAN: That's when I was in Montreal. But this phenomenon of designation of post
                    took place ten years before that. I was told almost, “You've got to go to
                    Montreal, because it's in the hands of a political officer now, and the only way
                    we can maintain Montreal, which is highly consular, like Toronto, is to have a
                    consular officer fill the slot.” It was a good opportunity, and I looked forward
                    to it professionally, but I did feel that when you get to be more senior in our
                    business, you are a symbol. I'd been around a lot of younger officers, and I do
                    know that they look to see, “Am I going to make it to the top or not?” I feel
                    that those of us who do achieve senior ranks should, indeed, go into those jobs.
                    Lorie Lawrence felt that when he went to Jamaica as ambassador and then to
                    Grenada. He felt it important to show that we can go into the competitive jobs
                    at the senior level. Yes, you've got to have qualifications, but based on my own
                    experience, I know a consular-cone officer can develop such qualifications. It's
                    a long answer, but I wanted to go on record to say that the battle to maintain
                    competitiveness on the highest level must be kept up, because the system is
                    tilted and will always turn towards the “substantive officer” as better
                    qualified for such opportunities. I would argue they are, however, less
                    qualified in many cases as senior managers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being the consul general, having political reporting,
                        economic reporting, other responsibilities. How did you deal with the
                        consular section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: Carefully. Rule number one was: I'm not in charge of the consular
                    section. Ann Campbell, when I arrived, was the chief. She welcomed me with open
                    arms. I think it was sort of like the famous two lies in the Foreign Service:
                    the inspector, when he gets off a plane asserts, I'm very glad to be here;” and
                    the ambassador answers, “I'm very glad that you've come.” I shouldn't say that.
                    I believe Ann, indeed, did welcome me, because she had known me over the years
                    and believed that some of the experiences I had would be of use to her.</p>
                <p>But you know, it is that same question we talked about in Beirut. How does the
                    senior boss find himself involved with subordinates without the middle-level
                    supervisor feeling caught in the middle? Ann was replaced by Mike Mahoney, quite
                    different in his approach to how Morgan should be the consul general. Back to
                    your question: you make sure that the intermediate supervisor knows everything
                    you're doing as you “muddle” in his section. In the Montreal case, none of the
                    other sections had the staffing size —8 to 10 officers — that the consular
                    section had. You walk a tightrope, because you've got experience, you've got
                    opinions. In some cases, you know what's being done by a subordinate is not
                    right, but you want the correction to come from the chief of the consular
                    section. So, by lots of chatting and lots of sharing of information and maybe a
                    little drama now and then, you work out that relationship. But this same
                    approach also applies to managing the other sections, particularly Admin and the
                    other agencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Another issue that we haven't talked about, surfaced in Paris, but it really came
                    out in Montreal. That is, when you're consul general, you don't realize the
                    authority you've got and the way you're looked at by subordinates. You think
                    you're still one of the troops, and you aren't. Worse yet, you can feel you're
                    exceptionally important and you have incredible authority, and you can forget
                    that you're simply a bit older, more experienced. Or you can go the other way,
                    avoiding the reality of being in a command position. It's a tightrope, too, the
                    specific role the principal officer has to play. How do you remain one of the
                    guys, at the same time be the leader?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, I think we might wrap this up at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: It was great fun. If I had to do it over again, I'd do exactly the way I
                    did it, but hopefully learning better from my mistakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is true. I think we represent people who came
                        in just as the wave was beginning to crest. The Foreign Service is beginning
                        to recognize the consular function as an equal—a grudging recognition, I
                        might add.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORGAN: When I left Paris, as well as other posts, I remember I said, “I had a
                    lot of fun.” If you can't leave an assignment saying you enjoyed it you haven't
                    been in the right assignment. And if a consular officer can't have fun being a
                    consular officer, you better go do something else. Go be a bored political
                    officer.</p>
