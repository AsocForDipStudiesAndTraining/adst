                <p>AMBASSADOR JOHN H. REED</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 21, 1991</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you would give me a bit about
                        your background, where you were educated, and early experiences before we
                        move on to your governorship, and the international aspects of it, and then
                        to Sri Lanka?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, I'd be pleased to do that. I was born in Fort Fairfield, Maine, and
                    educated in the public schools there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention Fort Fairfield as way up in potato
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: That's way up near the Canadian border, where you look right over to
                    Canada; and I graduated from high school there, went to the University of Maine,
                    and graduated in '42.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a good year to graduate, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, I moved quite quickly into the service. I went into the Navy, I was in
                    the Navy for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>REED: I enlisted in the Navy as a Storekeeper Third Class, and went to Newport,
                    Rhode Island. Following my boot camp, I was selected to be a drill instructor,
                    as a result of my ROTC at the University of Maine, and I enjoyed it very much. I
                    stayed there for about a year, and then was commissioned in the Supply Corps,
                    and went to Harvard for Supply Corps School. Afterwards I went to Mayport Naval
                    Air Station in Florida for a tour as the disbursing officer. Then I was
                    transferred to Cub 17, which was a unit selected to occupy one of the Pacific
                    islands. I went to Okinawa where I was a supply officer, and stayed there
                    through the duration of the war. After that, I came back and returned to my
                    hometown of Fort Fairfield, and went into the farming business which had been
                    operating for three generations. My grandfather Philo Reed was one of the
                    founders of the potato industry in northern Maine. My brother, father and I
                    continued to farm there. I stayed there for a number of years, and was always
                    interested in history and government, and politics. I ran in 1955 for the Maine
                    legislature, and was elected to the House. I served in the House for one term,
                    and following that I ran for State Senate from Aroostook County. I was elected
                    and served two terms. I ran for President of the Maine State Senate in 1957 and
                    succeeded to defeat an incumbent who had held the position for three terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were on the Republican side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I am a Republican. We had a Democratic governor at the time, Governor
                    Clinton Clausen. And in less than a year unfortunately Governor Clausen died in
                    office. We have no Lieutenant Governor in Maine, so I automatically succeeded
                    him as Governor. He had just started the first four year term in history in
                    Maine, after one year, and as I say, unfortunately passed away. So I served for
                    one year by succession, and then I ran for the balance of the unexpired term,
                    and won that election, and finished that term out. And then I ran and won a full
                    four year term on my own, so I served for seven years as Governor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I have you from 1960 through '66.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>REED: Yes, that was the very start of 1967. Then I returned to my home in
                    northern Maine—that was in January—and in April I got a call from President
                    Lyndon Johnson. I might say that in my final term as governor, I was chairman of
                    the National Governors' Conference, and got to know President Johnson very well.
                    We had a similar background: he was a rancher, I was a farmer, and we had many
                    things in common. We enjoyed each other's company. As a matter of fact, while I
                    was Governor of Maine, President Johnson was visiting our state and admired our
                    Maine deer which were considerably bigger than the deer in Texas. I shipped him
                    two Maine deer, hopefully to upgrade Texas deer. As I said, he called me up to
                    see if I'd be interested in serving on the National Transportation Safety Board.
                    And I hadn't really settled on exactly what I was going to do, so I decided to
                    accept. So I came to Washington in the spring of '67, as the only Republican on
                    this new five member board. It was established to determine the probable cause
                    of all transportation accidents, and to recommend corrective actions. I stayed
                    there for a total of nine years, eight of which, after President Nixon came in,
                    I served as chairman. I enjoyed the work a great deal, there was a lot of
                    traveling which I like.</p>
                <p>When President Ford came in he offered me an opportunity to go to Sri Lanka as
                    ambassador. I think every former governor would like to be an ambassador, so I
                    did accept that appointment and was there for one year. When President Carter
                    came in naturally there was a complete change. So I came back to Washington and
                    went to work for the Associated Builders and Contractors, as their chief
                    lobbyist. In my years on the Safety Board I had many contacts with associations.
                    I liked association work very much, so I found that an extremely enjoyable four
                    year period. I had done some work during the Reagan campaign and in 1981
                    President Reagan called me up out of the blue on Labor Day and wanted to know if
                    I would like to serve in his administration as ambassador to...and I wondered
                    what he was going to say. And he said Sri Lanka, so I told him I would be
                    delighted to go back. So that brings you up to date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to return to the governorship. We're interested
                        in the Foreign Affairs field, and I take quite a broad view in this program.
                        Maine has two provinces of Canada that you border, doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, New Brunswick and Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And basically you're just across the water to Nova Scotia.
                        During the time that you were there—this is '60 to early '67, how did you
                        deal as a governor with the sort of Maine provincial relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>REED: Most of the relations were with New Brunswick because Quebec borders pretty
                    much on our woodlands. I did make a couple of trips to Quebec but I didn't have
                    as much contact with them. However, with New Brunswick we did have a lot of
                    contact, and I went over there to meet with the Premier, and he came to meet
                    with me on several occasions. We worked on various projects and we were
                    especially interested in power development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bay of Fundy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, the Bay of Fundy was one of the projects. The Quoddy project was
                    discussed ever since the days of President Roosevelt. So we did have a lot of
                    contacts with New Brunswick and especially Premier Louis Robichaud.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were doing things, and then the
                        State Department would say, hey, wait a minute fellows, keep us informed. Or
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, I guess the projects never got that far along actually so that we
                    didn't have too much contact with the Department of State. But we would have, of
                    course, if that program had evolved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time when the Quebec Liberia Movement was
                        getting rather strong in Quebec, the separation movement. And there are
                        quite a few people from Quebec who have moved to Maine, haven't they, to
                        live there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Oh, yes, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any sort of manifestations of this while you
                        were there, or any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: We were aware of it. Many of our Maine citizens are Franco Americans and
                    did come down in the development of the textile industry. They settled in
                    industrial cities of Lewiston, Auburn, Biddeford, and Saco. Since many of the
                    folks did come down from Quebec we were well aware of some of the views on
                    separation, but we didn't get involved in that aspect. In Aroostook County, many
                    people traditionally came from Quebec to help with the potato harvest. In fact
                    in those days we didn't have modern equipment and it would have been very
                    difficult to get the crop out without the help of these good people from Quebec.
                    But as far as the Quebec provincial government, while I was governor, I don't
                    recall that we had anything other than perfunctory relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, moving back to the time that you went to Sri
                        Lanka the first time. It was 1976 when you started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of preparation did you get before you went
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I felt the State Department had an excellent program for preparing
                    ambassadors. We had many briefings, some at FSI and in the various departments,
                    and also on the Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, FSI is the Foreign Service Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: And I made it a point to visit with a couple of former ambassadors to Sri
                    Lanka. Ambassador Philip Crowe came over from the eastern shore, and I got a
                    great deal of information from him. And another friend of mine knew a Foreign
                    Service officer who had served in Sri Lanka, and I got together with him. I
                    found it extremely helpful to have input from someone who had actually lived in
                    the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sri Lanka sort of occupies a unique situation. I mean
                        there's this India-Pakistan conflict which is a can of worms from American
                        policy, and Sri Lanka is sort of down there and it's just plain different.
                        What was our policy at the time? American interests in Sri Lanka?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Actually, American interests were limited in the country. However, we were
                    very pleased that they were neutral, and they had a practicing democracy. We'd
                    always had very fine relations with them. There were some commercial interests.
                    We bought tea, rubber and graphite from them. Singer Sewing Machine had been
                    there, in fact they celebrated their 100th year while I was there. So we had
                    fine relations with Sri Lanka, and we maintained those relations. They also have
                    a very fine relationship with us. And, of course, the ship visits were very
                    important. We didn't have too many that first year, not nearly as many as in my
                    second tour. But that was a real plus because so many countries will not allow
                    our ships to visit. India wouldn't allow us port visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a matter of keeping good relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>REED: Yes, that is correct. For a number of years relationships had not been too
                    good. As I understand it, we favored the United National Party and they were
                    defeated by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. However, when they had the insurrection
                    against Mrs. Bandaranaike, who was the Prime Minister at the time, we did send
                    in some helicopters. That was under Ambassador Robert Strausz-Hup�, one of my
                    predecessors, and that did improve relations considerably. So when I arrived on
                    the scene I felt that relations were quite good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of Mrs. Bandaranaike, were they very careful to
                        brief you on how to pronounce her name before you went up for
                        confirmation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what the reference is to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: As I recall there was one candidate for ambassador who had been nominated,
                    and was having his Senate hearing, and he was asked to name the Prime Minister
                    of the country and he couldn't seem to remember the name, or pronounce the name
                    of the Prime Minister, and that was a rather embarrassing incident. That has

                <p>REED: That was Ray Perkins. Ray Perkins was a longtime Foreign Service officer.

                <p>REED: I would say you are right. Someone who has been in politics can usually

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes this is considered a detriment when we're
                        pushing trade. What was the situation in Sri Lanka during this '76-'77
                        period, particularly politically but also economically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Let's start with the economics. Actually they were at a very low ebb. Mrs.
                    Bandaranaike is a fine individual, I have great respect for her, and we got
                    along very well. Her policy was, at that time, not to let foreign imports come
                    in, feeling thereby that their own people would develop these industries. But
                    there was a shortage of consumer goods on the market, mostly of poor quality and
                    the country wasn't big enough, I guess, to develop the type of industries that
                    would provide the consumer goods that the public really wanted. She tried to get
                    programs going. It was pretty much of a socialist system. There were a lot of
                    government corporations and they just couldn't seem to generate the kind of
                    economy and industry they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you or your staff ever get involved in some
                        discussions on this pointing out, an economy of this size, this won't allow
                        for it, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>REED: That was a rather delicate subject, and we really didn't try to pursue it.
                    Sometimes they would question us about it, and we were glad to furnish
                    information, but we had to be very skillful as far as dealing with that
                    particular problem. They believed in their philosophy, and they were trying to
                    make it work, but it just didn't seem to be working. So that was it. The economy
                    was at a low ebb. There were a lot of people unemployed, and things weren't
                    working the way they hoped they would have. For instance, automobiles.
                    Practically the only automobiles around were a few old Austens, and Morris
                    Minors, and they kept them going, they made parts and you didn't see any new
                    modern cars around in '76-'77. So the economy wasn't in good shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that if they opened up things too much
                        there would be a flood of material, particularly from India, and maybe
                        Japan? Was this a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I think they were concerned about that. They wanted to build their own
                    economy up, and they were concerned they'd be carried away by opening up. You
                    could feel the ground-swell before I left at that time in '77. The public was
                    just dissatisfied. They had a free rice program, and still everyone was unhappy.
                    I remember my chauffeur saying after Mrs. Gandhi lost in India. “It's going to
                    be just like that here.” And he was right, they wanted a change. Mrs.
                    Bandaranaike was a very decent, honorable person who wanted to make things work.
                    But the philosophy, as I say, just didn't translate into reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on the political side of this dissatisfaction?
                        Because now we're looking, and I'm sure your second tour was filled with the
                        ethnic problem, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, I'd like to comment on it if I may. In my first tour you could travel
                    safely about everywhere. I went to Jaffna which is predominately Tamil a number
                    of times and everything was friendly. You couldn't see any great unrest on the
                    surface.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a sort of deliberate effort to make sure that we
                        kept relations open with all groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, we kept relations open, but it wasn't front and center in those days.
                    You knew there was a problem but it didn't seem to be of great proportions.
                    However, when I returned it was a complete turn-around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling...and again, we're referring just
                        to this one period, that the Indians were messing in the situation, or what
                        did you feel Indian policy was towards Sri Lanka?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>REED: The biggest concern between India and Sri Lanka was the repatriation of
                    some of the Tamils—the so-called estate Tamils who didn't have legal status.
                    They didn't vote and worked on the tea plantations. Sri Lanka was ready to let a
                    lot of them go back, but India wasn't taking them very fast. Also many weren't
                    anxious to go back. That was the biggest bone of contention between India and
                    Sri Lanka at that time. Of course India was looked upon as the big brother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how people looked at India?
                        Was it a benevolent big brother? Or maybe not so benevolent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, I think they always kept a wary eye on India. It was probably normal
                    to be concerned about a mammoth country like India exerting pressure in the
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure the Canadians could probably relate to that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Probably, and I guess we could understand that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, at embassies was there a pretty good mix say when
                        you'd have receptions between Tamils and Sinhalese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Oh, yes. There was no problem in those days at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just didn't have any feeling, “Gee, we've got so many
                        of this, we've got to have so many of that.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Not at all, and you hardly knew one from the other. The people themselves
                    hardly knew. I remember them telling me after the riots, “We didn't know, we
                    were all going to the same schools whether they were Sinhalese, or Tamil, while
                    we were growing up.” The seeds of dissent came after they became independent.
                    When Sinhalese became the national language, the Tamils felt they were being
                    pushed to the back burner. But in those days, as far as parties, or social
                    events, there was no difficulty at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you deal with the government? I mean, while
                        you were there Mrs. Bandaranaike was the Prime Minister. Which party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>REED: She was a Sri Lanka Freedom Party member. Her husband founded the SCFP. He
                    had been assassinated before I got there so I didn't know him. He established
                    the Sri Lanka Freedom Party during his early years. His family was very close
                    with the British. He went to Great Britain to be educated. But it was there
                    where he saw the thing differently. That's when he began to change and become
                    more nationalistic and changed his whole outlook. So when he went back he saw
                    the people wanted to be independent and that they should return to their roots,
                    and cultural heritage, and throw off the yoke of colonialism. And that's why he
                    established his new programs. He was a very dynamic man, and he espoused those
                    views to the people and naturally there was a great deal of pride in their
                    heritage. We understand that, so that's why the big change came. But that is
                    also when the problem started. That is the difference with the Tamils. They had
                    known each other for centuries. There had been enmity between the two because
                    the Sinhalese arrived first. Then the Tamil kings invaded from the north and
                    there were wars going on for years and years. So there was a latent problem.
                    However, during the colonial period they got along quite well.</p>
                <p>There was one thing that was always pointed out, and that is the Tamils are very
                    hard workers by nature and the British used a lot of Tamils in their government
                    services. Some of the Sinhalese were unhappy and felt the Tamils were getting
                    preferred treatment in the government service. Even President Jayawardene said,
                    “The Sinhalese people enjoy their Poya days, Peoratteras and festivals and don't
                    feel as committed to hard work as the Tamils.” So some of the traditions, and
                    characteristics of the two peoples caused some of the Sinhalese people to be
                    resentful. Some even suggested the British did this deliberately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The British tended to use different groups for different
                        things—the warrior classes, the governing classes, and this type of

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, so it's not unknown.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, it all depended on what issues we had. We would meet with her on the
                    major issues. The Voice of America station was one of our major interests. She
                    allowed us to keep it open. Some of the communists felt that it should be shut
                    down. However, after that insurrection, I believe in '71, we sent in helicopters
                    to help her and relations did warm up considerably. I dealt with her on the new
                    contract with Voice of America which was about to expire so we did get
                    preliminary discussions started on that. Also we were able to get clearances for
                    ship visits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are port visits of naval vessels.</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>REED: Yes, exactly. So, as I say, in those days there were a limited number of
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could talk...'76 was really sort of the
                        aftermath period of Vietnam, did you feel that American prestige, or
                        something...I mean we lost the war in Vietnam, that this had an effect as
                        far as the United States was viewed at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I didn't really detect that. I think they respected our position in the
                    world. However, it was difficult for us to adjust to the situation. 1976, you
                    will recall, was our bicentennial, and that was one of the biggest social events
                    we had and it was very well attended. Mrs. Bandaranaike came, so our relations
                    with her were very good. At that time there was a Vietnamese ambassador posted
                    in Sri Lanka. It was interesting because when I returned in 1982 they
                    discontinued their embassy. In those days the relations were much better with
                    the Soviet Union than when I returned. The Cubans were active but avoided
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the Soviets were trying to push you out? Was
                        it sort of a live and let live thing between you and the Soviets? Or was

                </p>
                <p>REED: I didn't see that much competition. We were always watching them, as they
                    were watching us. We were concerned, they were trying to get a foothold in the
                    Maldives. The Republic of Maldives was the other country I was accredited to, as
                    you know. We were concerned there because they were sending specialists in such
                    as medical people. We were afraid they were going to lease Gan which is a very
                    fine air base which the British left. And I think they probably did have designs
                    on it, and were trying to develop a relationship. So we were very suspect of
                    them in that aspect. It really was more to do with the Maldives than it was with
                    Sri Lanka.</p>

                <p>REED: About 450 miles. Things worked fine, I'd go over there probably a half
                    dozen times a year. It was an interesting change of pace to go over there, and
                    relations were very good. They were developing the islands for the tourist
                    industry. And so they too were open handed. They were concerned about the
                    Soviets taking over. So they held them at arm's length pretty much. They did
                    have some medical people come in, and a few doctors, and I guess soccer coaches
                    or something of that nature.</p>

                <p>REED: No. In those days we didn't have anybody. We did have a consular agent
                    later, a native lady. But, we had nobody there at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were developing tourism at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: They were developing tourism. They are very resourceful people, and they
                    sensed there was a market for it. They had many small islands right around Mali,
                    and they would develop a number of these islands for tourists. They were
                    wonderful. The accommodations were pretty modest, but the climate is excellent
                    and they were getting a great clientele from Europe. The Germans liked to go
                    over there in the winter, and the Maldivians were making a good profit on
                    tourism. There was a different president in my first tour. Later they had a
                    palace coup and a new president took over. But anyway, they were developing a
                    national tourist industry. They are a very practical, pragmatic people. I was
                    very impressed with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were at that point beginning to establish the island of
                        Diego Garcia as a major base which was later used during the war with Iraq
                        in the Persian Gulf. Were they making any feelers towards maybe doing
                        something in the Maldives, or mainly just to keep the Soviets out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: It was to keep the Soviets out. We pointed out what a great base it was. I
                    used to tell the Department we had to keep them out. There was considerable
                    criticism in Diego Garcia by the communist element in Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ceylon has got one of the great ports anyway, doesn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Oh, yes. A deep water port, and that has been developed a lot in recent
                    years. It has been developed further and that's why our ships liked to come in.
                    But Diego Garcia did come in for a lot of criticism from the leftist
                    element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about things like...Sri Lanka has been sort of a
                        charter member of the non-aligned movement. It changed a lot since the early
                        days when it was a real thorn in our side. How did we feel about it in the
                        mid-'70s when you were there, and Sri Lanka's role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, we respected their position in the non-aligned. In fact that first
                    year I was there they had a non- aligned conference, and that, of course, was
                    the highlight of the whole year, and all of them showed up. It was a big event.
                    So we respected it, and tried to counsel them against the more extreme elements
                    in the non-aligned. We didn't have too much difficulty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with the United Nations votes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I'm glad you mentioned that because that was one of our major interests.
                    They generally took a neutral role, and sometimes were supportive. One of the
                    U.S. real interests there, was their support in the United Nations. That was one
                    of the things I would discuss with the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that she would listen? Or did they have their
                        own thing, and you felt it was a pro forma thing to go with the yearly
                        shopping list of the issues that we're interested in? Every ambassador does
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, we did that. But on individual votes from time to time I would make a
                    demarche and meet with the Foreign Minister directly. I also had a lot of
                    contact with the Foreign Minister, and with the Foreign Secretary. They were
                    quite helpful. A number of times they would take a position that would be
                    contrary to the non-aligned, and we appreciated that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the period you were in Sri Lanka this first time,
                        Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State. I was wondering...I'm not sure if it
                        happened right at your time but during the separation of Bangladesh from
                        Pakistan. Henry Kissinger was the prime architect in sending an aircraft
                        carrier task force up into the Bay of Bengal, and so-called tilting towards
                        Pakistan. This was some time ago, but did you sense any kind of either
                        resentment or aloofness, or anything about that type of policy? The
                        Indian-Pakistan equation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I didn't really sense that. Mrs. Bandaranaike was very close to Mrs.
                    Gandhi, and they were pretty much pro-India at that time. But, no, I didn't
                    really detect that point of view. In regard to the fleet it must have happened
                    before I got there because I don't recall any of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a burning issue. Just going back to the
                        political thing, there's an outfit which issues a yearly report called
                        “Freedom House” and I notice in early '76 they listed Sri Lanka as partially
                        free, and then at the end of the year they listed it as free. It's sort of a
                        world survey and this is one. Had things changed much regarding political
                        prisoners, or that type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: There was always some criticism about political prisoners even during that
                    early period. And I didn't think things changed too much while I was there. The
                    Prime Minister had kept a number of them in jail after the insurrection. She let
                    some out as President Jayawardene did later. But I didn't see too much in regard
                    to this. There was a lot of criticism afterwards, but during that period I
                    didn't see much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we haven't...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: As I say, the economy was at a standstill, there were no buildings going
                    up, and there was a great deal of unhappiness and discontent, of course the
                    campaign was well underway before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Near East Bureau concerned about how this
                        discontent might turn into something? Were we saying, “Gee, this thing might
                        turn radically leftist,” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: There was always that feeling, but no, I don't think there was too much
                    concern. Actually we were tracking the election campaign, and it looked quite
                    favorably to the UNP. But there had been an election before when the UNP was
                    defeated and it was felt the U.S. favored them, and that made Mrs. Bandaranaike
                    very distressed. And our relations were quite cool at that point. So I tried to
                    be very even handed in our contacts with all parties. It wasn't too much of a
                    problem along that line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to your next phase. Do you have any idea why
                        they called you back to go to Sri Lanka, within the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: No, I cannot recall any particular reason. Possibly it could have been
                    because I was only there one year and I was familiar with the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was really about four or five years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, about four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you served from '82 to '85.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, I was confirmed in December, 1981 and got over there in January,
                    1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went over...you, of course, were an old hand by
                        this time, but what sort of briefing did you get, and preparation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>REED: The thing that sticks out in my mind was a briefing about the ethnic
                    problem. It was a much more prominent issue than in the first tour. I also went
                    to the United Nations for a briefing. Overall it was excellent preparation for
                    both me and my wife. But there was a big change when I got there. I could
                    describe that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, if you would.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: OK. It was as different as day and night, an absolutely incredible change.
                    The Japanese, of course, had really arrived. There were brand new automobiles
                    running around, new buildings going up, and a lot of construction. South Korea
                    was also there, some of their contractors were there. Japan built a brand new
                    1000 bed hospital and gave it to the government. Banks were coming in. The Bank
                    of America came in, City Bank came, and also American Express. The free trade
                    zone was going strong, and some textile industries had started. So it was just
                    different as day and night, absolutely booming at that time. They were
                    developing the port, and they had a whole new young team in there and everything
                    was coming up roses. It looked just great. Couldn't believe the big change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the new government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: This is the new government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they come from, and who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I left in July of '77, just when the election was coming up. Mrs.
                    Bandaranaike was defeated and President Jayawardene of the United National Party
                    was elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you spell his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: J-a-y-a-w-a-r-d-e-n-e.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the transcriber.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>REED: We all called him J.R., his first name is Junius, but he always went by the
                    name of J.R. I think he was in his mid-70s, because he was in his 80s before I
                    left. He is a fine gentleman, a tall man, had great energy, a very clean living
                    man. He drank coconut juice every morning. The Prime Minister became the number
                    two person, and the President was the one with the power, and that was President
                    Jayawardene. When I got there, of course, they were all entrenched. They had a
                    big majority in the parliament, and they had a group of young lieutenants who
                    were coming on strong. One heading up the port, another heading up the great
                    Mahaweli scheme which many countries came in and gave millions to develop this
                    river, the Mahaweli Valley River to bring many more acres of land under
                    cultivation. The British built a big dam. They wanted us to build a dam, but
                    somehow our AID people felt, “well, let's do something to get the water off to
                    the people.” We didn't get much attention, because that wasn't as glamorous, or
                    spectacular, as dedicating a huge dam. But we put a lot of money into it, giving
                    the conduits taking the water down to the farmers. So things were booming and
                    going along nicely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we have a Peace Corps, or anything like that
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: We had no Peace Corps, when I arrived but they were invited in by President
                    Jayawardene. He called me over and said he wanted to get the Peace Corps back to
                    teach English. He felt that one of the real problems was if the young people
                    wanted to go to a foreign country to study they had a great handicap, because
                    they couldn't speak English. So that's what got the Peace Corps back after a 13
                    year absence. So we did bring them back, and it was also during this period I
                    worked on renegotiating the agreement for the Voice of America radio
                    station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there pressure to get it out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: They were a little reluctant to go ahead. They really were because they
                    were getting pressure from the left. So it went on and on, but maybe I'm jumping
                    ahead of my story.But, of course, after July of '83 they took a much more
                    conciliatory view on that, and we finally did wrap it up and got the new
                    agreement. They were a little wary about going into it because I'm sure the
                    Soviets were opposing it. They wanted to maintain an even handed relationship
                    with the super powers. Relations were not nearly as cordial with the Soviets the
                    second tour as it was in my first tour. The first tour was rather open and
                    friendly. The second was rather reserved because of the relationship with our
                    country at the time. In the early Reagan years it was pretty much of a stand
                    off.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this is the evil empire. Did you have a feeling as
                        ambassador that the Ford administration was not as ideological as certainly
                        the early Reagan years? Did you have a feeling that you were representing a
                        different country in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, I did. You didn't see nearly as much social activity. It was very
                    strained and reserved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under any pressure from the White House, or the

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, on a number of issues, considerably more demarches the second time,
                    especially votes in the United Nations, and things of that nature. There was
                    much more contact. Of course, I was there a lot longer. There were a lot more
                    things, and more interest, we had a lot of cables from the Department asking to
                    see the Foreign Minister particularly to get support on various issues such as
                    the Puerto Rican situation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, statehood for Puerto Rico became a big issue. The average American
                    wouldn't know what I was talking about. But it was a pretty potent issue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, one of the major ones was, their sensitivity in regard to any
                    criticism of the government. I should bring this in because this erupted fairly
                    early in my tour. We had a very fine, young, political officer who had some
                    experience—the election was just coming up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Kenneth Monroe Scott.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw some reference to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>REED: Kenneth Scott is a fine young man. The election was coming up, and he would
                    be talking with people, and trying to get some insight into the election. I
                    recall one particular incident which took place at the American Center at a
                    reception. Ken was talking to a close friend of the President and he said, “What
                    about corruption?” Apparently this man told the President about it, and it
                    became a big issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was normal political work...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, he was just trying to find out about these issues and it was
                    interpreted as trying to exert influence. The Foreign Minister called me twice
                    on the matter, and then it went on for months. Finally the President even
                    mentioned it to me. They were determined, and we fought as hard as we could.
                    Finally they forced the young fellow to leave and I think it was very
                    unfortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think actually wasn't there a quid pro quo? I think Sri
                        Lanka had to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I think that's what happened, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you felt this was something blown up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: It was blown up way out of proportion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for domestic reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, it got a lot of coverage, that may have been part of it. I don't
                    know, but it could have been because of thin-skinned people. I don't know how
                    this was interpreted. Scott was a man who wanted to do his job, and felt he was
                    just trying to be objective, and he was interpreted as interfering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have had an inhibiting effect on all of you in
                        doing your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, for a long time it really got to be a major issue, and I didn't think
                    it would get to those proportions, but it did. And as I say, we were not happy
                    about it whatsoever, we didn't feel it was justified, and we said that right to
                    the end. But finally, in talking with the Department, we moved forward on a quid
                    pro quo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in general it was much more difficult to deal
                        with various parties? I mean, was there more sensitivities so the embassy
                        felt inhibited? Were political passions getting higher, or something like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: They were getting higher, but we kept on doing our job. I didn't feel it
                    inhibited us really in a sense, and with the election coming up, we were
                    scrupulously careful to be neutral, and just get the facts, and keep in touch
                    with the other elements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The election was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, let's see—that election was shortly after I got there, it must have
                    been '82. The President was reelected by quite a margin. However, the next big
                    thing that came up was, suspending the parliamentary elections. And that caused
                    a lot of problems. The President defended his position. It bothered many people
                    and looked like a danger to the system. Suspending the parliamentary elections
                    meant binding them in for another five years. The President took a lot of
                    criticism on this position. I remember him telling me, “Even Abraham Lincoln did
                    it.” He felt very defensive. There was a great deal of unhappiness among some of
                    the embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was nothing particularly overt that caused this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: No, I wouldn't say there was. But that caused a lot of unhappiness, why he
                    would just suspend these elections, and bind these people in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Tamil-Sinhalese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, let me get into that. I was about ready to mention that. I made a
                    visit in May of '82 to the north. Here again there was a dramatic change in the
                    Tamil areas. There was an obvious change in the attitude of the Tamils. They
                    were much more militant. I remember here again, as if it were yesterday, that we
                    had a big event at a hotel and I met a lot of the leaders, and some of the
                    younger leaders wanted to see me after the meeting. So I naturally stayed and
                    talked with them, and you could see they were deadly serious about the concern,
                    and for us to try to keep an even handed position as far as the issues that they
                    were pushing for. They felt we should not try to interfere with it. They felt
                    the Sinhalese were trying to hold them down. They said there was a large element
                    in their population that was prepared to make radical changes. So you could see
                    there was a tinder box in the north. As a matter of fact that was in May of '82,
                    I never did get back up to Jaffna again.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this too dangerous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, it was considered too dangerous. In my first tour I was up there
                    often. So I knew right then that this was a big issue, it was altogether
                    different, it was real serious this time. It would never be referred to in a
                    humorous way. The Tamil leadership there was more of a moderate type, they were
                    in the parliament, and I met with all their leaders and they mentioned some of
                    these things. They weren't nearly as militant as the younger people, but you
                    could see they were very serious about it. And when the thing erupted they all
                    resigned. I always felt that was a mistake. They were forced to take a loyalty
                    oath, and this led to another problem. The President had started a program of
                    improvement projects. I talked with an older Tamil who was heading up the
                    program. I asked him, “How do you think this is going to work?” “Well,” he said,
                    “its got to work out.” I remember, he was an older leader, a lawyer. He said,
                    “If this doesn't work out, there's going to be a real problem. This thing is
                    going to degenerate badly. We're going to watch it to see if they give us the
                    money, and develop it, and improve the economy up here. We're going to watch it,
                    and if it doesn't work out there's going to be an extreme change.” In July
                    things got worse, and there were the riots. You could see the change, in the
                    eastern province also, but of course Jaffna is practically 100% Tamil. They are
                    fine people up there. I come from a farming area and noted that they raise most
                    of the potatoes in Jaffna. It was tragic to see what had developed in this
                    beautiful country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could see these things; obviously we were
                        reporting...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I reported all these things back to the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything we could do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: There was very little we could do. At that point I don't know what we could
                    have done to avert the problem. I don't know as there was too much we could have
                    done. We didn't intervene at all, which I don't think we should have at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Indian government? Did you have a feeling
                        that they were beginning to fish in the troubled waters, or were they
                        unhappy about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, they took an almost ambivalent position because at that time
                    obviously some Tamils were training. It was generally known India was being used
                    as a training base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened during the riots as far as the American
                        embassy and your work? What sparked these riots?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>REED: Well, I arrived at post in January of '82, and I was there a year and a
                    half and I was coming back to the States for R&amp;R. I just arrived in
                    Washington when the riots erupted. I received a call from my PAO. I said, “I am
                    glad to hear from you.” “Well,” he said, “you won't be when I tell you what's
                    going on.” When he told me about the riots, I made plans to immediately go back.
                    Mrs. Reed stayed here in Washington, and I went back at once. You could see the
                    havoc that had been wrought. It's a long way from the airport into Colombo and
                    you could see all the devastation, homes had been burned, and people had been
                    killed. The American embassy was all right. There wasn't any particular problem
                    at the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't sort of leftists stirring up the mob?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: No, not against ex-patriots, and I never did see any of that during the
                    rest of the time. They were careful not to, because that would have hurt their
                    cause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was rioting against whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: It appeared to be the extreme elements in the Sinhala community were
                    destroying a lot of the Tamil homes, and killing people right on the street.
                    Hundreds and hundreds of burned vehicles were all over the place, stores and
                    factories were destroyed. It was generally blamed on some of the extreme
                    elements in the Sinhalese community. The devastation was enormous...they just
                    ravished Colombo, and created a permanent enmity for the foreseeable future
                    between the Sinhalese and the Tamil communities. The Tamils are good business
                    people and there were a lot of Tamils in the business community, so it put them
                    in a difficult position. The damage was enormous. In those days we were still in
                    the old embassy. That was unusual, I might mention as an aside, when I was there
                    in '76 they were developing plans for the new embassy. Well, I looked them over,
                    and they looked fine. I never dreamed I would come back, but I actually came
                    back and dedicated the building in the fall of '84. The construction was
                    underway when I arrived in 1982. Some of the embassy people did have trouble
                    getting to their homes, but no one was injured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this mean to your mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>REED: I should mention we had a lot of Tamils working in the embassy and, of
                    course, they were severely frightened. Actually some were so threatened that
                    some of the senior people were allowed to come to the States. Quite a few came
                    from our embassy, and of course, we were besieged by Tamils wanting to get out,
                    and the consular office was swamped. This was the big impact upon us. Of course,
                    we also tightened up security. When we moved into the new embassy security was
                    tightened up considerably, and there was always a threat then about where you
                    could go, what you could do, etc.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest incidents we had while I was there was the kidnaping of an
                    American couple, in the Jaffna area working on one of the water projects.
                    Fortunately we were able to secure their safe release.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, it appeared that extreme Tamil elements had taken them into custody.
                    In fact, I couldn't attend a chiefs of mission meeting in India that the Vice
                    President attended. I didn't feel I should leave the country while this was
                    going on. The pressure became very heavy, and in fact, Vice President Bush spoke
                    to Mrs. Gandhi about it, and I think she exerted some influence. Finally they
                    were released to a priest of the Catholic Church, in Jaffna. I think they were
                    kidnapped for a week or ten days. I think the terrorist felt they made a mistake
                    because it hurt their cause. It was a very tense time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What affect did this have on AID, Peace Corps, and this
                        type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, it inhibited doing anything in Jaffna. We finally had to shut that
                    project down. It even slowed down a number of projects in the Mahaweli Valley
                    because the terrorists would make raids and some people were killed. So it did
                    impinge considerably and cause slowdowns on a number of other AID projects. We
                    had just about reached our peak in doing things, you know, in the dollars
                    expended. So from then on it was all downhill, I mean, things were phasing down.
                    I don't think to this day that the water project was ever completed.</p>

                <p>REED: Yes, they became embattled up there from time to time. They had an old
                    Dutch fort and that was surrounded a number of times. They had to use
                    helicopters to get supplies in to them. We did get a few Americans up under very
                    guarded conditions, but they certainly weren't suggesting Americans go up. There
                    were also problems in Vaunuia, we had to send some Americans up. There was a
                    priest killed, and some suspected their soldiers did it. No conclusive evidence
                    was found.</p>

                    well informed of these various elements. Of course, they had a number of
                    competing groups during that time. The LTTE, the Tamil Tiger's group, and a
                    number of others. Since I've left, the other leader has been killed and
                    militants were pretty much the LTTE. They are still in the jungles and carrying
                    on the civil war. There is a feeling they have got to learn to live with
                    violence.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: No, that came much later. They sent a new Ambassador over there to help

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before this, did you feel there was any dispute within the
                        Department of State, or White House instructions of how to treat this? Were
                        they trying to blow this into a communist conspiracy by any chance? Or were
                        we able to keep it as an ethnic thing, rather than a geopolitical
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I think we did. I think their government tried to portray it that
                    communists were providing support for the militants. They wanted us to bring in
                    a battleship as a show of support. They were naturally very concerned. The
                    President was anxious to get some military support, but we advised him we could
                    not do that. Caspar Weinberger was coming in for a refueling stop, and the
                    President wanted to see him.</p>

                <p>REED: He was Secretary of Defense at the time, and we arranged for him to meet
                    with the President. They used every possibility to get us to influence the
                    situation, and to help them out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes. We were very careful, very even handed. They wanted to buy more arms,
                    and munitions from us, so we just had to stay within our guidelines and
                    regulations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that the Soviets, or even the

                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, there was talk that the Yugoslavians were selling them arms. The
                    Soviets, I think, felt they wanted to try to avoid looking like they were
                    supporting the insurgents. They had to walk a fine line also.</p>

                <p>REED: Yes. They were trying to have a neutral posture, and were open handed with

                <p>REED: You'd hear talk about it from time to time, but it didn't erupt into a
                    major problem. They knew we had to have a base over there, we had it and nothing
                    they were going to say was going to change that. You'd see signs, graffiti,
                    “Americans get out,” and then references to Panama and Granada, the usual

                <p>REED: Well actually, it appeared they were beginning to phase down. I made a
                    number of trips there, and talked with the President. They did not want to get
                    in anyone's pocket and they assured us they were not going to let the Soviets
                    get a foothold. There were a few Soviets living there and the government kept a

                <p>REED: Generally speaking they were excellent. I did have the opportunity to
                    select my own DCM. I do think it's useful for an ambassador, especially a
                    political type, or any ambassador for that matter, to have an input into the DCM
                    selection process.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: No. All my PAOs were excellent people. I had three during my tours, they
                    kept good relations with the people in the press. We got our stories across
                    quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem on the narcotics thing? Because I
                        recall later on at some point Sri Lanka became involved with Sri Lankans
                        outside of Sri Lanka...became involved in the narcotics business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, there was some of that going on. As a matter of fact we urged them to
                    tighten up their drug laws. We had experts come over from the States to help
                    them on this. I remember attending a big drug session. They did tighten up their
                    laws while I was there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that Sri Lanka was sort of a way

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>REED: Well, there were allusions of that, but I don't think anyone felt it was a
                    major transit point. I don't think it was that bad. There was some, of course,
                    with tourists coming in and they arrested some on drug violations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Carter years, human rights all of a sudden
                        became a major thing. Did you find this was a problem for you as the

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, it was an emerging problem, and there were many more contacts from the
                    Department on human rights. They became very sensitive on it, especially on the
                    human rights report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you handle this? I mean, this is always a very
                        tricky thing. Most ambassadors would almost wish the thing would go away
                        because it doesn't help their work particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: No, it doesn't. They had a veteran Foreign Secretary and I would sit down
                    and we'd talk about it. We generally got along all right. We did spend
                    considerably more time on it during my second tour.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, after the riots we felt there were some, and we kept pointing them out
                    to the government. We did what we could to urge them to be careful. They felt
                    their backs were to the wall, and they became very defensive on these
                    matters.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the fighting, obviously when you've got an
                        insurrection like this the military takes a greater role. How were our
                        relations through our attach� and yourself with the Sri Lanka military? And
                        how did we view this? Was this a professional military a la the Indian
                        military, or was this getting more political a la the Pakistani
                        military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, that's a good question. We generally felt they were pretty much a
                    parade ground army. They were not a very effective fighting force at that time.
                    Hopefully they have improved considerably since then. But we felt they had a
                    definite problem as far as that was concerned.</p>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>REED: I'll refer back to 1976. China had given to the country a great conference
                    hall, the Bandaranaike Memorial Conference Hall. Sri Lanka felt very close to
                    China, and the feeling was mutual. The two countries had a rice and rubber pact.
                    A lot of rice came from China, and Sri Lanka gave them rubber in return. So
                    there was a very close relationship. By the time I got back the second time, we
                    had relations with China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we weren't looking on the Chinese as meddling

                </p>
                <p>REED: No, not particularly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Chinese did not have a community as they did in

                </p>
                <p>REED: No, it was very small.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, a small merchant community. It wasn't a major factor at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Department? Did you find much
                        attention to Sri Lanka? Or did you feel that as long as you didn't get
                        assassinated, or your embassy surrounded or something, that was what they
                        wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, I think as long as everything was going all right we weren't on the
                    front burner. We had good response from the Department when we needed it.
                    Overall we had excellent relations with the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As every administration...particularly one that has sort
                        of an ideological center—I mean we went through it with Carter, and we went
                        through it with the Reagan administration, they start from one position and
                        then some events come along and eventually they usually end up at about the
                        same place. Did you have the feeling that the Reagan policy as regards that
                        area was changing at all? Or were they getting a little more relaxed about
                        the “Soviet menace” or something like that there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Oh, I think they were always pretty wary. During the time I was there it
                    really didn't change too much, it was pretty much hands off.</p>

                <p>REED: It came later. In fact I thought they were even more hands off than in my
                    first tour. They only wanted junior officers to attend events. I think that was
                    a mistake.</p>

                <p>REED: That's right, and I felt the same way about their functions. I couldn't see
                    sending a junior officer. The Soviet ambassador came to a couple of my things
                    even then which I thought was good. On the other hand, I couldn't go to his
                    events. It was very petty.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Probably so. I think it's shortsightedness. I couldn't see anything to be
                    gained whatsoever, and I think it was a mistake. I felt embarrassed frankly that
                    I couldn't go to some functions they had. I just thought it was a mistake.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, but of course once the riots started, we were very concerned about the
                    safety of the Peace Corps volunteers. In fact we brought some of them back to
                    Colombo for a time, and I think that has been an ongoing problem because it's
                    pretty dangerous out in the countryside. But the program itself was going
                    strong.</p>
                <p>Oh, I know what I was going to mention. That is, it was very interesting that
                    they were looking for help wherever they could get it, and they wanted to make
                    some contact with the Israelis. It got in the press and the leftists were really
                    complaining. The government did want to get some contact with the Israelis. So
                    we had to interface with them, and finally they did get an Interest Section. The
                    President wanted it, he felt there was some benefit. It was an interesting
                    development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they after from the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, I think they felt there was some intelligence they could get as far
                    as developing their skills in fighting the insurgents. That was it. And yet they
                    got assailed in the press, and the leftists were all over them. But they moved
                    forward, and the Department wanted us to cooperate, so we did. But that was an
                    interesting aspect, I thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any pressure on us to send out our counter-
                        insurgency specialists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, they wanted any help they could get, but naturally we had to be very
                    careful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under strict instructions not to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Oh, absolutely. Our government felt it wasn't appropriate. It got to the
                    point that they wanted anything you could give them. I felt sympathetic for
                    them, but we could not get involved. It was sad to see the problems emerge in
                    the Sinhala and the Tamil communities. They are both fine people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>REED: I left in September of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And at that time where did you see Sri Lanka going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Well, it looked like they were going through a long period of instability
                    as far as maintaining law and order was concerned. You almost wondered if they
                    could ever really get it back to where it was. And another thing I'll always
                    remember, after I came back from home leave in 1983 I saw the President and
                    said, “Mr. President, you were moving to try to correct the situation.” I'll
                    always remember, he said, “But I didn't move fast enough,” these are his words.
                    I think they might have been able to stem the tide if they'd done more to try to
                    assimilate the Tamils into the mainstream. Maybe I'm wrong, but I always
                    remember him saying that. He didn't do enough, and move fast and forceful enough
                    to show they wanted the Tamils to be equal citizens. So there was a turning
                    point in history. If they had been able to have done that, things may have
                    worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is all over pledge allegiance to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: Yes, the government demanded a pledge allegiance to the country and here
                    were these Tamil parliamentarians put in an impossible situation. Thirteen of
                    them resigned so the Tamils had no representation in the government. And these
                    people were pretty reasonable, and they might have been able to work something.
                    So there was no one in there to represent the Tamil viewpoint. There were some
                    fine Tamil lawyers and students who tried to help and with whom I always kept in
                    touch. However, there just wasn't enough give and take and it was too late.
                    Maybe I'm wrong, but I always felt if they'd moved early enough they might have
                    stemmed the tide and changed the course of history. But it was tragic and it's
                    still going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. We really appreciate
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REED: I hope it has been helpful.</p>
