                <p>AMBASSADOR JAMES W. WINE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 4, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, before we begin discussing the period in
                        your career as an ambassador, would you give us some information concerning
                        your background which led to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I practiced law. I graduated from law school and went into the Army in
                    1942, returning to Kentucky to practice law. During that time I served in
                    various capacities aside from teaching and the general practice of law. I had
                    been active in the Presbyterian Church, and in the aftermath of the Senator
                    Joseph McCarthy era, there was a broad-gauged attack on Protestant, and to some
                    degree, Catholic ministers by a disparate fundamentalist group. They charged
                    that the ministers of these various denominations, including the heads of the
                    denominations, were a part of the communist apparatus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made them think that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: It grew largely out of the fact that, at about that time in the late 1950s,
                    most of the protestant denominations began to emphasize a “social gospel” as
                    they called it. That strayed from fundamentalism. This particular group of
                    people elected to put the lie to what I think the Protestant churches were
                    trying to do at that time which was to lift up the social questions in this
                    country which had, heretofore, been largely ignored except by a few perceptive
                    writers. It was very widespread and the attack became very vicious.</p>
                <p>The then principal officer in the Presbyterian Church, whose headquarters was in
                    New York at the time and whom I knew quite well, had discussed this at great
                    length with me together with some others. As a layman and as a lawyer I was
                    interested in this kind of thing.</p>
                <p>They said, “How about taking some time off and seeing if you can't do something
                    about this in the interests of people who really can't defend themselves?”</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I took about 18 months and leave of absence and associated myself with the
                    National Council of Churches, under whose aegis this defensive campaign began.
                    For about 18 months, together with some other lawyers who volunteered their
                    time, we concentrated across the country on trying to torpedo this kind of
                    foolishness and drive these fellows back to where they really belonged. It
                    really wasn't a theological debate. They tried to put that kind of face on it.
                    It was actually more one of grasping for power at that time. This was
                    sufficiently after World War II and the general public was coming back to and
                    being a part of church activity across the country, the consequence of which was
                    competition with the mainline churches.</p>
                <p>In the course of that experience I became quite concerned about the whole matter
                    of religious freedom and went into it in considerable detail. I attended many
                    conferences with Catholics and Jews as well as Protestants that began to give
                    much more visibility to the whole idea of religious freedom. This was between
                    1956 and 1959.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of that effort, John Kennedy became a candidate for president
                    of the United States in early 1960. As I began to notice, some of the same crowd
                    who had heretofore been attacking Protestants as communists became very vocal as
                    critics of John Kennedy's candidacy as a Catholic. For those who remember, it
                    was a very vicious kind of thing. Certainly, the criticisms were not limited
                    solely to people who were church related but were from political interests,
                    monied interests, and special interests who opposed Kennedy's candidacy. They
                    jumped onto and hid behind the religious bandwagon, so to speak, believing that
                    that was where his greatest vulnerability was.</p>
                <p>I began talking with people such as Ted Sorensen and Senator Kennedy in early
                    1960 about this whole matter of religious freedom, and more specifically about
                    those who would try to establish a religious test for political office. I was
                    moved at that point more by conviction and principle than by the candidacy of
                    anyone in particular.</p>
                <p>I became increasingly closely associated with Ted Sorensen, in particular, and
                    others of the staff such as Ralph Dungan who later managed the White House
                    staff. Before the West Virginia primary in March 1960 we had an ad hoc group
                    that was consulting on this whole matter, and we concluded that it would be
                    worthwhile to see if we could get a statement from the principal Protestant
                    leaders in the United States, heads of denominations, so to speak, which would
                    reflect what they believed was a real contest of convictions and which opposed
                    the idea of a religious test for public office.</p>
                <p>By force of circumstances alone, I assumed the responsibility for obtaining that
                    particular statement. I knew these men personally by virtue of the previous
                    eighteen months experience which I've described. At my invitation we met
                    together in New York in February of 1960. After I explained the purpose, we were
                    able to hammer out a multi-paragraph statement to which each of them subscribed
                    in their capacity as heads of their respective Protestant denominations
                    representing all of those in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>We published that statement and it did have a salutary effect to a great extent,
                    insofar as the church community was concerned as well as the opinion makers at
                    the head of the church community. We then began to see, from the political
                    viewpoint, that we had diluted, to a certain extent, the forcefulness of these
                    criticisms on this particular issue. By no means did it do away with it. As a
                    matter of fact, it had the effect in some circles to increase the effort, money,
                    and criticism on the part of those who opposed Mr. Kennedy's candidacy.</p>
                <p>I became increasingly involved with that particular question, meeting from time
                    to time with the campaign group, principally at the level of Ted Sorensen who
                    had more or less within the campaign group taken charge of that particular
                    issue—not solely, but he was the lead horse as far as those very close to Mr.
                    Kennedy were concerned.</p>
                <p>It was later suggested that this was such an issue that it became an integral
                    part of the campaign and that it would be advisable to establish an organization
                    within the campaign which would devote its time to this particular issue. I was
                    invited to take charge and take that responsibility, which I accepted.</p>
                <p>In the course of those months, I became much more personally acquainted with
                    those very close to Mr. Kennedy and I found that we had a great deal in common.
                    We shared thoughts of performance of responsibility at the highest level of
                    excellence. Our world views were very similar, and certainly we shared the
                    notion that a religious test as a precondition for candidacy for public office
                    was dead wrong and had to be buried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel yourself as the outsider to begin with? You
                        actually came in on a matter of principle and not that this candidate was
                        the right person. Here were these cold-hearted political pros who just saw
                        this as an obstacle. I'm sure the principle was there, but to them this was
                        an obstacle. Here you were, coming from a legal practice and having dealt
                        with the issue. You are also a practical person, but you were not on board
                        as an early Kennedy man. There must have been quite an educational process
                        to go through both from your point of view and theirs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Yes. There was indeed. You've analyzed it correctly. My motivation was just
                    as you have described. Of course, as I say, the more intimately acquainted we
                    became, the closer our relationships became. We found that we were
                    intellectually committed and in agreement so that, just like topsy it grew. My
                    own thoughts had expanded, never leaving the central proposition which motivated
                    me in the first place to become a part of it.</p>
                <p>So I did spend full time on that issue and I had no intention of coming into the
                    government service. Having fought a war, I figured that that's about all the
                    government service I was interested in at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had you been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I was in the European theater of operation from 1942 until 1945. I had a
                    “Cook's tour” of England, North Africa, Italy, France, and Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which division were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I was with the 34th Airborne Brigade.</p>
                <p>In any event, Mr. Kennedy—and this I know as a matter of fact—hewed the line very
                    carefully all during the campaign. There was never, to my knowledge, a promise
                    to anybody about anything. His only comment to all of us, even those closest to
                    him, was, “If I'm elected, I hope you'll help me.”</p>
                <p>That was it. Of course, everybody responded in the affirmative and that was that.
                    I had made plans to go on back to the practice of law in either New York or
                    Washington. I hadn't made up my mind yet. After you go through a presidential
                    campaign, it's rather a wearing process and you have to give yourself some time
                    to put your feet up and reflect. Thanksgiving and Christmas were coming on and I
                    thought that I had to think this through a little bit. I had a number of
                    conversations with friends in different places about returning to the practice,
                    during which time I was called by members who later became part of the
                    Administration and asked if I would serve in the Administration. My response, as
                    I recall it, was, “That's a rather broad statement. I guess I'll have to know
                    what we're talking about. Be more specific.”</p>
                <p>“Well, we're not sure.”</p>
                <p>The transition, of course, was still going on. My memory was refreshed that we
                    had committed ourselves to helping him and we were very much convinced about his
                    presidency. We were very much convinced that we all had so much in common. We
                    had grown up in the Depression, fought the war, and we felt as if there were
                    things we could do. At least, this was our philosophical outlook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There really was a generational feeling there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: There's no question about that. The President in his inaugural address said
                    something to the effect that “the torch has been passed to another
                    generation.”</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>There was a very strong philosophical consensus among a lot of us, regardless of
                    how we came into the campaign originally. The people involved under President
                    Kennedy had what it took to achieve the kinds of things we thought ought to be
                    achieved in post-World War II.</p>
                <p>So I held myself in abeyance and still made some temporary contacts about
                    returning to the practice of law. I was called and asked if I would be
                    interested in serving in the State Department. It was well known among these
                    people in the Administration about my interest in foreign affairs. We had had
                    enough conversations back and forth through the months to know that. So I said,
                    “Yes, I would be very much interested and it would depend upon some practical
                    matters, family, etc.” I had four children.</p>
                <p>Shortly I received a telephone call asking if I would be interested in becoming
                    the Chief of Mission. I said, “Where?”</p>
                <p>They said, “Israel or Luxembourg.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, my wife and I both speak French. I helped re-take Luxembourg in
                    World War II. If I have any kind of choice, I would be interested.”</p>
                <p>They said, “There's more to it than that.”</p>
                <p>My law practice had involved coal and steel, and Luxembourg was the seat of the
                    European Coal and Steel Community as you well know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was the progenitor of the entire European community,
                        the Common Market, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Exactly. Even after the Treaty of Rome, many of the first organizational
                    meetings were held in Luxembourg because they were already set up and had the
                    membership of the Coal and Steel Community in place. They just changed the
                    players. This fact was brought out. I said, “Yes, I am familiar with that.”</p>
                <p>In general, those were the things that took me to Luxembourg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what you were doing during the war in
                        the Luxembourg area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: We were part of the 7th Army and Luxembourg had been occupied early on when
                    France fell. The Germans were pushed back, and during the Battle of the Bulge
                    Luxembourg was occupied again. In the process of the 7th Army moving eastward on
                    the front, Luxembourg was in the 7th Army area and the troops comprising those
                    with which I was a part moved through that corridor that re-took Luxembourg.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you particularly interested in foreign affairs
                        prior to joining the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I think not unlike anyone else who may have had advanced college degrees
                    and who read a good deal more than the ordinary person. I think exposure to
                    Europe in World War II as a very young man opened my eyes tremendously to
                    first-hand cultural differences despite the circumstances of hostilities. It
                    also reawakened my own interest in history. John Sherman Cooper, who was the
                    Senator from Kentucky and later Ambassador to India, and I were very close
                    friends. John and I had many discussions about the United Nations during its
                    infancy. At one point John suggested to me back in the mid-1950s that I ought to
                    come to Washington and maybe look into some possibility of going into the State
                    Department, particularly in the U. N. side where we had discussed a number of
                    things.</p>
                <p>So I came up and visited for two or three days, but it was a gradual growing
                    thing. I found my own perspective in the world broadening considerably. I tried
                    to inform myself and I was attracted to various publications, books, etc. which
                    dealt largely with foreign affairs. I think it just became an integral part of
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your experience is very typical of a generation of people
                        who were informed citizens, particularly those who participated in the war.
                        It put many people on a different course. It paralleled also the rise of the
                        United States as a power in the world. Prior to that, our diplomacy was
                        really almost marginal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: That's correct. We were just there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and with a couple of oceans in between. In going to
                        Luxembourg, did you have any particular preparation for being the Chief of
                        Mission from the State Department or the White House, any particular
                        instructions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Yes. I spent about six weeks in the Department, an extended period largely
                    on my own initiative. I had a learning process to go through. I was fortunate to
                    have conversations with a number of people from Averell Harriman on down talking
                    about ambassadorial capacities.</p>
                <p>I might mention that on one occasion I asked Averell Harriman, “I don't know
                    anything about being an ambassador and I'm trying to learn.”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>He said, “I'll give you two pieces of advice. Always know when to take one step
                    backward when you're negotiating. The other one is to remember that there are
                    two kinds of ambassadors: those who are interested in being and those who are
                    interested in doing. Be the latter.”</p>
                <p>Retrospectively, I think that those two cryptic statements were the best piece of
                    wisdom that I've ever run across anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I heartily agree. Of course, Luxembourg had the
                        distinction of having too many ambassadors who were more impressed with
                        “being” rather than “doing.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: That's what the Luxembourgers thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the mission in Luxembourg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: It looked to me like it was a storekeeping proposition with very attractive
                    people competent in their particular assigned tasks. They were not taking any
                    initiatives and were not being required to, apparently, from what I could judge.
                    I felt that there was a failure to assess certain important propositions. For
                    example, Luxembourg's small army was integrated into and became a part of the
                    United States Army for training purposes. In cases of hostility within the NATO
                    plan, it would have been under U. S. command. This is the first time in American
                    history that a foreign country's military had been made an integral part of the
                    U. S. military. This presented some very interesting experiences over a period
                    of time while I was there.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the airport was built by the United States and was part of the NATO
                    infrastructure, targeted to be used in the event of hostilities and built into
                    the defensive plans of Europe.</p>
                <p>There had never been the usual trade, commerce, and friendship treaty, so I took
                    the initiative on that and negotiated it to mutual satisfaction.</p>
                <p>The Luxembourgers, and not without justification, had a very negative view toward
                    the Germans for the treatment that they had received. Several of the ministers,
                    as a matter of fact, in the government while I was there had actually been taken
                    over during the war and put into labor camps. They told me the stories of their
                    experiences. As a consequence, I think one of the tasks was not to point
                    out—which would have been a futile thing anyhow—to the Luxembourger that they
                    couldn't afford to continue to be hostile to their neighbor but to try to work
                    at creating a climate of better understanding, looking toward the future as to
                    what Europe was going to be. They would have to work together at some point.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>It was easier for an American to take that position than it was for anybody else,
                    any of the other ambassadors from the other countries. While that was done
                    persistently, it was done low-key by simply taking advantage of occasions in an
                    effort to try to change—not necessarily in defense of or in favor of the
                    Germans, but trying to create a better climate of harmony in Europe in that
                    small country which was rapidly becoming the financial center.</p>
                <p>Originally, Luxembourg was to be the general headquarters for the Common Market.
                    Subsequent decisions put it in Brussels. The trade-off was that all of the
                    participating partners would aid Luxembourg in becoming a financial center along
                    the idea of Switzerland. They had good banking laws and they wanted better
                    banking laws and to attract financial institutions, etc. A small country like
                    Switzerland for generations was in an awfully good position to do something like
                    that. They have been successful. So that was the trade-off, the consequence of
                    which I had a modest hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that Luxembourg was pushed aside by
                        our concerns with France, Germany and England?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Yes, I think so. I think there had been a long history of benign neglect as
                    far as the little country was concerned. The Department had not been, perhaps
                    understandably so, in tune with the discussions that were going on within Europe
                    to which I have just referred a moment ago—the trade-offs, the move to Brussels
                    making it the financial center, keeping the European high court in Luxembourg.
                    These were the trade-offs that were made and I think the Department was quite
                    tardy and was beginning to see the significance of those trade-offs that were
                    made.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I remember particularly when Bill Tyler was Assistant
                    Secretary for Europe. I remember when Bill Blue had the office of Western
                    European Affairs. Both men and I became good friends, and in the course of
                    numerous discussions and exchanges of correspondence and official cables, a lot
                    of these things began to get more visibility and the significance began to be
                    appreciated a good deal more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware of the battles within the State Department
                        between the Europeanists who were looking at integrated Europe and pushing
                        that—I think George Ball was the prime exponent of this—and those that said,
                        “That's all very well, but we have relations with France, with Germany, with
                        England, etc. Let's not get completely overwhelmed by this Europeanist
                        thing.” Did you find yourself involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WINE: I was very much aware of that and knew of this bifurcation of viewpoint
                    within the department. I knew George Ball's position very clearly, but I also
                    knew the position of a number of the career people and I found them divided on
                    the particular point that you described. I think it was an intellectual
                    political struggle that was going on with the best intention on both sides. I
                    saw the world a little differently and, of course, outside the State Department
                    there were various and sundry organizations that came into being such as the
                    Atlantic Council which continue to exist and perpetuate this very strong feeling
                    between the United States and Western Europe. There are a number of such
                    organizations of which I'm sure you are as familiar as I. That viewpoint still
                    exists and I'm watching it with a great deal of interest as we go toward
                    1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the date of the full integration of Europe. Did you
                        find yourself falling into a camp or were you between the individual country
                        people and the integrated Europeanists? You were there from 1961 to
                        1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I don't think I became an apostle of either viewpoint. I think I
                    appreciated what they were saying on both sides, but at that point I watched to
                    see where the interests of the United States could best be served in the little
                    country of Luxembourg as these two schools of thought began to emerge and
                    gel.</p>
                <p>I remember on one occasion a particular issue in Europe that taught me a good
                    lesson. There was a man, the old man of Europe, Joseph Bech. He and Trygve Lie
                    were the two first candidates for Secretary General of the United Nations. He
                    was a Luxembourger and a long-time advisor to the royal family and government
                    and always had been a part of it. Joseph Bech and I grew to be great
                    friends.</p>
                <p>I had an instruction to ask if he would take a certain position to the NATO
                    Council in which the United States was very much interested. I went to see Mr.
                    Bech and he said he wanted to make it very clear that he was sympathetic but
                    that, in the context of the forum in which we were talking, if Luxembourg took
                    the lead, he felt it would be rather silly because they did not have the
                    military power to back up the proposition that he would introduce. He had no
                    intention of making himself look silly. However, he would certainly be a party
                    to any of the negotiations going on—the reason they selected him is because he
                    was a man of considerable stature in Europe at the time. He felt it would be a
                    serious mistake from the standpoint of Luxembourg itself to take the lead in
                    that move for the reason I just mentioned. Q: How did you deal with the
                    Luxembourg government? Who were your principal points of contact?</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WINE: I was very fortunate in the fact that I had four children, twin sons, a
                    family, and by far I was the youngest ambassador that they had had there. The
                    Kennedy Administration was looked at most favorably. I was the unwitting
                    beneficiary of all kinds of things for which I could not take credit under any
                    circumstances. I was received with open arms in the most genuine, warm way. The
                    Prime Minister who was also the Minister of Finance lived just one block from me
                    and frequently, on Sunday afternoons, while walking with his family and I with
                    mine, we would stop in and visit, have a cup of coffee and talk at great length.
                    We became very closely associated outside of official circumstances which was
                    very helpful. This was an experience that occurred with considerable frequency.
                    I remember sitting up in their front yard watching the Tour de France on one
                    occasion. There was a big park just above the street there. As I said, on Sunday
                    afternoons we found our families comingling, walking and talking. The wives
                    established an excellent rapport. The Foreign Minister and I developed quite a
                    good friendship as well.</p>
                <p>When we had the first satellite that went up that had the transatlantic
                    telephonic communications, I remember it was about two o'clock in the morning.
                    We were all in the mayor's office downtown with all of the powers that be
                    talking with the mayor of Albany, New York. We have pictures of that event. They
                    felt like they were in direct contact for the first time with the United States
                    on a large scale. These were little things which were symptomatic, I think, of
                    the very warm relationship.</p>
                <p>I might say, on the other side of the fence, they made it very clear to me that
                    they didn't like it worth a damn that Luxembourg was used from time to time to
                    send people over there who spent most of their time out hunting or simply giving
                    parties, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, one of the most famous ambassadors, probably
                        the most famous ambassador there, was Perle Mesta.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: She was a minister.</p>

                <p>WINE: It was a joke as far as Luxembourg was concerned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it would be. In a way it was a joke in the

                </p>
                <p>WINE: It did not at all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about Sunday ambassadors who really look
                        upon certain assignments as a pleasure tour. Were you able to communicate
                        this to the White House? Each administration seems to go through this
                        process. Maybe they never learn or don't really care.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I'll give you my personal opinion about it. I've thought about it a good
                    deal after having the privilege of the experience. I would refer you to Ted
                    Sorensen's book, Kennedy, part of which deals with the method of selection of
                    ambassadors, and more recently, Interviews With Robert Kennedy, which is a book
                    that just came out last summer. It's just a collection of interviews. In both
                    instances very specific reference is made to the selection process and the
                    criteria that they established. That was one condition which was very clear in
                    everybody's mind at the time. It's true that, looking back, President Kennedy
                    undoubtedly rewarded some individuals who really didn't do a damn thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back and speaking as a professional Foreign
                        Service officer, there was a feeling that there was more sense to many of
                        the Kennedy appointments. There was an attempt to attain a degree of
                        excellence that had been lacking in many cases. It wasn't perfect, but at
                        least there was more of a sense that people outside the Foreign Service
                        ranks were being sent because they had something particular to offer rather
                        than just being a heavy contributor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I think that was the essence and I think that was the intention. This was
                    said in my presence more times than once. As I say, if one reads not just the
                    two sources I gave you but others which reflect the thinking that went on, it
                    would reinforce your conclusion. I saw a perceptible change in what I felt was
                    the down-grading of ambassadors, particularly during the Kissinger years, when
                    so many visiting firemen from Washington were sent to various countries as a
                    matter of routine when there were problems here or there.</p>
                <p>If I had been an ambassador in a country where they had sent someone, implicitly
                    that would have said to me, “We're going to send somebody over who knows more
                    about your country and the problem than you do.” They would have had my
                    resignation in six hours. I think that was one thing that began to change the
                    whole picture.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, and this perhaps sounds like it's in a partisan sense, but it's
                    something chronologically and historically true the way the successions came on.
                    I'm not comparing individuals necessarily but only circumstances. I thought
                    increasingly the role of ambassador was being diminished and oftentimes I
                    couldn't blame the individual. I rather thought that the system was changing.
                    Maybe this is what they wanted to do. I would call your attention to the May 11,
                    1961 letter that John F. Kennedy wrote to all ambassadors, with which I'm sure
                    you are familiar. I think that pretty well set the tone as to what his viewpoint
                    was regarding the role of ambassadors. I do not think that viewpoint exists at
                    the present time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The letter you are referring to stated very specifically
                        that the ambassador was in charge of everything dealing with the United
                        States in a country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Not only in charge but responsible for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Responsible for, and it was very well received and
                        overdue. I think it goes out now as a routine but it's not really observed
                        as much as one might say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were not in Luxembourg too long and then you went to the Ivory Coast. How did
                    this come about? You went to Luxembourg in April of 1961 and you left in October
                    of 1962.</p>
                <p>WINE: I can only tell you what I've been told. The President of the Ivory Coast,
                    Houphouet-Boigny, was the first African chief of state to have a state visit
                    during the Kennedy Administration. Black Africa is, among other things, a
                    personality cult. Houphouet-Boigny and John Kennedy got on personally very well.
                    At this point I'm reciting what I've been told from the White House. On his
                    departure he asked Mr. Kennedy, “When you send your ambassador down there, would
                    you send somebody whom you know personally, because then I'll feel as if this
                    linkage of friendship is being maintained.”</p>
                <p>It was explained to me that that was the trigger mechanism. Among those who were
                    around at the time of the selection process, that was why I left early and in
                    response to the request from Houphouet-Boigny. That was the President's
                    response.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about this? Here you were in Luxembourg
                        with your wife and four children and had established a good relationship in
                        the country. Now all of a sudden you were going to a whole different place
                        in Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I was called on the phone from the White House and asked about it. I said,
                    “I'm going to have to think about this a little bit. I don't even know where the
                    place is.”</p>
                <p>They said, “Well, send us a cable tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>That day I did learn that Abidjan was probably the most modern city. I talked
                    with friends on the phone in Paris who knew the Ivory Coast quite well. They
                    told me about it. I was also interested in education. I understood that
                    President Kennedy and Houphouet-Boigny had talked about the establishment of the
                    university in Abidjan and that they were very much interested in having people
                    in key places in Africa. This was a Presidential policy decision. Then there was
                    a pause and he said, “Hell, you're an adventurer. You certainly shouldn't have
                    any objection to going down there.”</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I sent a cable the next day accepting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the peripheral negotiations. How
                        did the real one go when you went to your wife and told her? I speak as a
                        retired Foreign Service officer who knows one's diplomacy begins absolutely
                        at home. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: No question about that. There was a long session that evening. We got out
                    the maps and all of the printed material I could find. I had them send me a post
                    report, of course. I had all the information I could get. Yes, it was a family
                    decision. I certainly didn't make it in a vacuum. We were quite young, just in
                    our mid-forties, and we thought it would be an opportunity for a real experience
                    and knowing the background of the reason for the selection, that polished
                    somebody's ego a little bit, I guess, along with it and that was the family ego,
                    not just mine. There was no reluctance on the part of the family, and so there
                    was an affirmative decision collegially made. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our perception of the Ivory Coast in relation to
                        American interests there? We're talking about 1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Politically it was perceived as being, and was in fact, a showpiece made by
                    the French. It was known that Houphouet-Boigny and De Gaulle were close friends.
                    Houphouet-Boigny served in the Fourth Republic, as a matter of fact, as a
                    minister. President Kennedy had no use whatever for De Gaulle, and I'm not
                    suggesting any kind of unusual motive but it was thought that it might be a good
                    idea to meet him on an even playing field in select countries that had more
                    significance than Upper Volta or wherever. The French had paid an awful lot of
                    money to develop Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>The second thing was that we were very much concerned about air space in West
                    Africa at that time, keeping it exclusively American or certainly within the
                    Western Alliance and precluding the Soviets from getting landing rights anywhere
                    along the West Coast of Africa because it was such a close jump from there over
                    to South America. One of our principal chores was that we selected Pan American
                    Airlines and negotiated landing rights up and down the coast of West Africa,
                    building into it certain rights carefully and which we successfully did.</p>
                <p>We then paired Pan Am with assisting in the establishment of Air Afrique. That
                    was part of the agreement. With the exception of Guinea, which had jumped the
                    tracks and gone Soviet on us, but other than that we were able to protect the
                    entire West Coast of Africa from the standpoint of air rights and precluding the
                    Soviets from obtaining landing rights down there. That was a national security
                    consideration.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I think it was believed by many with a long, long view that the continent of
                    Africa might open up and become the bread basket of the world. I think also that
                    there was an aspect of the whole civil rights issue involved dealing with blacks
                    in Africa. Those were some of the kinds of things that went into the
                    decision-making process. We had some first-rate folks in West Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we do a little compare and contrast? Luxembourg
                        obviously has over time been treated as far as ambassadorial appointments
                        has not always been treated well because we've sent too many people who
                        throw parties or hunt. I assume this has had a reflection on our embassy and
                        the staff there. There's no point in showing too much initiative if you're
                        going to have somebody who is mainly going to be involved with the social
                        list. Now you're in Africa at the time of greatest interest. The Kennedy
                        Administration was interested in Africa, new countries were emerging, the
                        Foreign Service was having a wonderful time. It was the first time that the
                        professionals were able to get in there and really deal with things. How did
                        you find the American staff in the Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I had a splendid staff. It's with a great deal of pleasure to me personally
                    to know that two members of that staff, young men, have since become
                    ambassadors. One was Bob Oakley who is now Ambassador to Pakistan. It was a
                    large embassy because we had regional security, defense attach�s, an airplane,
                    regional agriculture, any number of different things. They are regional because
                    of our location and the total communications situation was such that Abidjan
                    would be a natural for that. As a consequence, we also had a very large Peace
                    Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM)—helpful
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: The man who was the incumbent, a nice chap, felt that he should have been
                    appointed ambassador. This is not without precedent in the State Department. He
                    never demonstrated this to me, but there was a deep resentment that he wasn't.
                    There were communications that went back and forth and a successor was sent in
                    the very near future. He was first rate. He and his family were just first rate.
                    The entire staff was the cream of the crop. Q: I think this does reflect where
                    priorities go and where enthusiasm and real interest is. As ambassador there,
                    what did you consider your prime tasks?</p>
                <p>WINE: My first task was to look at the larger picture which had to do with the
                    landing rights issue. We had a rather large AID program which I had to monitor
                    very carefully. It got out of hand two or three times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WINE: I'll give you one example. They had asked for help in their internal
                    communications. When the AID communications group came, they found out that they
                    wanted to develop a rather high-tech communications for the presidency, in the
                    broad sense, so as to develop a network of communications for security purposes.
                    This was an adjunct to the principal program but this was done rather quietly
                    and without my knowledge in the beginning. Then I learned that AID was sending
                    back messages that did not go through my hands or my designated person having to
                    do with intercepts that these communications fellows had made concerning the
                    communications that were going on within the government itself and the system we
                    had established. I blew the roof off and I sent them all home and I dismissed
                    the program.</p>
                <p>The more successful ones had to do with assisting in their fishing industry, in
                    their infrastructure, some roadways, airstrips, agriculture, etc. which were
                    geared toward the inner-strengthening of the country's economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the charges levied against the entire AID process
                        which is not exclusively the United States but there was a tendency to build
                        up the cities to attract people to African cities with the full cooperation
                        of the local governments but destroying the agricultural base and
                        agricultural life of those countries. Was this a problem in the Ivory
                        Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: No, the opposite was true. Houphouet-Boigny had a very different view. He
                    wanted to maintain the integrity of the villages and concentrated on expanding
                    those throughout the country. He discouraged any migration into Abidjan. He
                    designated centers for cotton and certain other kinds of agricultural products
                    in one area as well as other kinds of things in another area, and he worked
                    diligently at tribal integration so as to avoid the classic problems in Africa
                    of tribal collisions from time to time. He had a marvelous program that did just
                    that. He's never had one ounce of trouble among the tribes. He saw his country
                    in its totality without a focal point in the sense that you suggested it.The
                    French, on the other hand, saw it quite to the contrary. They wanted to build up
                    Abidjan so I had to struggle with the French constantly on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the French there? You were saying
                        that the use of the Ivory Coast was a subtle ploy to bypass the De
                        Gaulle-Kennedy antipathy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: We maintained a discreet distance. I had to respect the fact that there
                    were still a number of French conseillers in the government as they went through
                    a transition preparing the seats for the ministers, etc. I knew they were there,
                    and I knew this was what Houphouet-Boigny wanted because he had people in there
                    with experience. So I respected that.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>On the other hand, I met them head on when the occasion demanded. An example of
                    that was when I had the French ambassador call on me to tell me that the Peace
                    Corps out in the country was teaching English and other subjects as well, and
                    that education in the Ivory Coast was exclusively a French proposition. I called
                    his attention to the fact that we had an agreement with the government of the
                    Ivory Coast what the Peace Corps could do, and among other things it was to
                    teach. As long as they were there, they were going to teach. It was just that
                    simple.</p>
                <p>I'd get complaints maybe twice a month from the field saying the French were up
                    there harassing them. I'd go over to the French Embassy and raise hell with the
                    French ambassador telling him I wanted that stuff cut out. [Laughter] “If you
                    want to kick them out, you go down and see the President and tell him to kick us
                    out. Short of that, live with us.”</p>
                <p>There were two ambassadors from France, the second of which was a personal friend
                    of De Gaulle's [Laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had learned his lesson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Monsieur Le Trompet. He and I had some tangles, there's no question about
                    that. The French positioned themselves such that the entire diplomatic corps was
                    alienated as far as the French were concerned, particularly the diplomatic
                    representatives, with the exception of one DCM. He was a first-rate chap. He saw
                    things as they really were. He used to come over to my house, and I'd have my
                    chief of station come over and have lunch at the pool. We'd swim and I'd invite
                    him over and we'd just have a sandwich and talk. We learned a whole lot more
                    from him than he learned from us. Nevertheless, we had an ally who was a genuine
                    representative of his country and not out trying to win brownie points from De
                    Gaulle every other damn day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do I suspect that Houphouet-Boigny was sitting back and
                        being both amused and taking advantage of the fact that he had two personal
                        friends of these leaders playing in his yard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: A typical political ploy. There is no question in my mind about it. I think
                    he was very genuine. I think his viewpoint towards France was very different
                    than his viewpoint towards the United States, generally speaking. On the other
                    hand, he saw this and knew this was there. I would never go down and crowd his
                    doorstep. The French ambassador did many times because word had gotten back to
                    me from the chief of protocol at the palace about what had happened. I had
                    several sources where I kept up with what was going on here and there, all quite
                    legitimate. He'd go down and whimper and cry around. Not once did I ever
                    complain to the President about the French.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Houphouet-Boigny is really a remarkable man among world
                        leaders. How did you view him at the time? You've given us some aspects. In
                        dealing with him personally, how did you find him? Why do you feel he
                        developed into such a remarkable person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: His education was medical. He had a medical degree. He was quite
                    sophisticated. As I said, he served in the Fourth Republic. Politically, he was
                    the head for many years, before independence of the various countries, in the
                    RDA, which was the political party of all the French colonies. So he was
                    politically very savvy about the whole of West Africa and its relationship with
                    Europe as well. He was also a very clever man. He protected his flanks. He's a
                    quiet man and moved with great strength when he wanted to, but he usually
                    achieved this in an indirect way as opposed to getting out on the stump and
                    preaching a sermon about it. This is one of the ways he brought the tribal
                    groups into community, for example. He had a very clear perspective in his own
                    mind of the significance of the Ivory Coast and West Africa and Africa in
                    general. We talked at length about that many times. He didn't think that an
                    Organization of African States was of much value. He thought that was mostly a
                    lot of baloney and that they'd never, despite the fact they meet once a year,
                    with great visibility. They passed a lot of resolutions that they would not
                    honor in a year or two and still acted their own ways. He didn't put much stock
                    in that. I think he was a man that had a world vision. He was a man of deep
                    compassion and I think he knew the limitations of his rule, of his government.
                    He kept extraordinarily well informed about world matters and political matters
                    in the United States and Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the height of the racial problems in the United
                        States, the Freedom Riders, Martin Luther King, etc. As a very sophisticated
                        world leader, how did he view the agony the United States was going through
                        as well as the blatant segregation and animalism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I had a long talk with him after the Martin Luther King's “March on
                    Washington.” He, of course, had seen the television clips of Bull Connor's
                    episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Alabama police repression of black
                        protesters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: That's right, using the water hoses and the dogs, etc. These were not just
                    quick meetings of five-minute visitations. I knew what his signals were when it
                    was time to go, but we talked at great length, most times at his insistence. He
                    would say something like, “I've seen examples of man's inhumanity to man. It
                    happens in this country.”</p>
                <p>I have been in ceremonies way up-country where his police, when the crowd would
                    come out to view the ceremony and they wouldn't move back, would take big sticks
                    and whack them.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>“I acknowledge these kinds of things. I have an appreciation for the history and
                    the lack of evolving the black persona. It will probably be a philosophical
                    attitude and will probably be a long struggle.”</p>
                <p>He was very much impressed with the Martin Luther King leadership. His feeling
                    was that there was a wealth of understanding, good will, and compassion in this
                    country, and that given time, that problem would be not necessarily solved but
                    alleviated in many ways. He was not hostile toward us or openly critical toward
                    the United States, never in my presence. I think he'd seen it all, really,
                    himself. That pretty well explains his views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever asked by Washington to sound our his views
                        on something in order to pass back professional advice on how to deal with
                        African affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Yes, on numerous occasions. I would have to refer to the files, but I was
                    instructed on numerous occasions to visit with him and to put certain questions
                    to him. Even if I put it to him, he would be the kind of fellow who would say,
                    “I would not presume to tell the American Government. It would just be his
                    attitude. But he was very helpful to us in many ways at our request using other
                    African chiefs of state at a time when the Red Chinese were moving with great
                    strength down on the other side of the continent, Tanzania building railroads,
                    etc. There were times when there were other matters that were based in Africa
                    but involving outside powers, not the least of which was Sekou Toure in Guinea
                    which we tried to do some things about, but I don't think he openly succeeded in
                    doing anything before Toure died. Then there were questions involving several
                    countries in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the African Bureau in the Department of
                        State? Mennen Williams was leading it and I've gotten two reflections on
                        this. One was that those dealing in difficult states such as Guinea, Ghana,
                        etc., there was a little two much overly-positive thinking about some of
                        these leaders who really were not friendly to American interests or probably
                        to their own country. I'm thinking of Sekou Toure and Nkrumah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>On the other hand, he brought a great deal of enthusiasm toward Africa and played
                    a very important role in the Administration in developing interests in Africa.
                    You were in one of the “good” countries, probably the best which has remained
                    the best as far as the bright side of African development. How did you find the
                    Mennen Williams direction?</p>
                <p>WINE: I'm trying to think who his deputy was who went on to the Ford Foundation,
                    a very able man and who knew what he was doing and moved professionally. The
                    “hail fellow” back-slapping type of American was not appreciated positively in
                    the Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Soapy Williams would fall into this category.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I guess so. Of course, not speaking the language made it difficult for him.
                    I don't think he visited but one time and that was to buy African art. He bought
                    a truckload of African art. I had the feeling that, outside of his deputy, he
                    was very ineffective. I really don't have an opinion. I have impressions but I
                    don't have an opinion about something with respect to the other countries. I
                    know what went on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't particularly intrude where you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: No. Nobody intruded. [Laughter] I must say in one instance where the
                    president called me down and said, “When am I going to get my grant for the
                    university?”I said, “Well, I'll get right on that and find out.”I knew about
                    this before I left Washington. I knew about it from the White House, not the
                    State Department. I came back to the embassy and sent a cable to make the
                    inquiry. I got a response back from somebody which said, “According to paragraph
                    501, subsection C, the Ivory Coast as well as all other former French colonies,
                    the matters of education are exclusively in the French province. Therefore, we
                    have no program.”</p>
                <p>I thought, “I'm forced to call a chit.”</p>
                <p>So I wrote President Kennedy and told him the story. Nobody is going to put me in
                    this kind of position. I still have the original letter. He wrote up in the
                    corner, “Jim Wine is right about this. See to it they get the support that they
                    ask for.” I got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where the politically appointed ambassador who
                        knows the President can do something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Yes, because I was a lost ball in the high weeds. I was being batted around
                    with a number of paragraphs. I wouldn't have gotten [anything] out of it save
                    coming home and doing battle and maybe not even then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A thesis that often comes up is that America's interests
                        abroad are essentially driven by economics. How much would this pertain to
                        our interests in the Ivory Coast at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WINE: I wouldn't say “driven by.” It certainly was one of the driving forces but
                    it was not by any means predominant. I think we all recognized there was a
                    building of a vast amount of volume of trade between the third world and the
                    United States. I think that was being encouraged. The AID programs that we were
                    involved in were obviously essentially economic but they went beyond that. Some
                    of them were instructional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were not commercial interests in the United States
                        that you felt great pressure to do certain things with the Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm asking about American commercial interests in the

                </p>
                <p>WINE: No, it was cultivating the relationship, establishing some specifics within
                    the broad policy of Africa and more particularly the west coast of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back to Washington in 1967 and you spent some
                        time as Special Assistant to the Secretary for Refugees and Migration. What
                        did this job consist of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: It consisted largely of being concerned with, in part, legislation
                    regarding refugees, but more particularly liaison with the United Nations High
                    Commissioner for Refugees, independent organizations dealing with refugees, both
                    political, economic, etc. This was during a period of time when they were
                    redefining what is a refugee and what are the rights of a refugee, etc. It was
                    essentially more consultative at that time than anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it was between times. There had been the great
                        refugee problem after World War II and after the arrival of the communist
                        regimes in Eastern Europe and before the collapse of our interests in
                        Indochina around 1975 or so, then later in Iran, etc. In a way it was not
                        the eye of the storm that it later became and had been before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: No. During this period of time we were essentially working in cooperation
                    with other agencies, governments and activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular problems that you had at that

                <p>WINE: No, I don't think there was a lot of interest in the department at all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WINE: I think the greatest satisfaction came from those quiet moments when you
                    introspectively examined the responsibility that you had in terms of being the
                    American representative in a foreign country representing our government to that
                    government, and the broad benefits that flowed from the relationships which that
                    office presented to you with leaders of the countries or the regions where you
                    were, products of a different culture, sometimes in the very broadest sense. I
                    think I could not answer that with any specificity.</p>
                <p>I would have to say that it was a broadening of my own educational understanding
                    of the world in which we live for which I was very grateful. I was pleased to
                    have an opportunity from time to time to use my own initiative in doing things
                    that I thought would achieve or work toward the achievement the policy of the
                    United States as I understood it in the relationship between the two countries.
                    I was very pleased when it worked out successfully, and I regretted it deeply
                    when it didn't. I think that pretty well says it. I was a young enough man and
                    had few, if any, prejudices and predispositions. I was open minded and hope I
                    still am. It couldn't have been at a better time in my life from the standpoint
                    of being able to have a better understanding of the world of which I was a
                    part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If a young person came to you today and asked, “Should I
                        join the Foreign Service?” how would you respond to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: Of course, any response I gave them today would be predicated on my own
                    experiences which go back a decade and a half and may not be reflective of
                    current conditions with which I am not familiar. I would have to qualify
                    anything I said. I would have to make some prefatory remarks, suggesting that I
                    spoke from another era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These will be read in another period, even if you were
                        talking about today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WINE: I would have to say that, in giving the individual the benefit of the doubt
                    as far as the motivation of service and intention to serve at the highest degree
                    of excellence, I can think of no higher calling than being able to represent
                    your country to another country.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>That suggests eliminating assignments domestically. I wouldn't say that.
                    Assignments domestically are preparatory periods or coming back from time to
                    time for further assignments down the road. I would tell my own children this if
                    they would ask me. I would say that I can think of no higher calling. The cat's
                    pretty much on your back to make a success of it.</p>
                <p>I think I said a “calling” but I think it's more of a calling than a “cause” if I
                    were to distinguish between them. It provides great rewards.</p>
                <p>I further believe, however, that the individual has to examine his or her own
                    temperament rather carefully as to how they think they might coexist and live
                    successfully in another culture, of getting out of the culture shock business
                    which frequently causes problems. Therefore, I think I would like to ask the
                    questioner a number of questions myself to satisfy my notions as to whether I
                    thought they had the temperament. That's somebody else's job, not mine, but you
                    can always spot things here and there. If they're talking about the glory road
                    or their expectations, or if they're talking about drudgery, it's not that
                    because you have too many opportunities for your own initiative. I would say at
                    this time in history, the world has shrunk the way it has and is so
                    interdependent that one couldn't hope for a better opportunity to be a part of
                    the world that we live in. I can't think of another one and I include commercial
                    activities, commercial corporations, etc. These things are just very different
                    because your priorities are different. I think that would be my response.</p>
