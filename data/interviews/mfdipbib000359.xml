                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Ambassador Farland]</p>
                <p>Q: This is an interview with Ambassador Joseph S. Farland. This is being done on
                    behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and I am Charles
                    Stuart Kennedy. Today is January 31, 2000. You go by Joe, don't you?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes, I go by “Joe.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I go by “Stu.” Could you tell me when and where you were
                        borand something about your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was born in Clarksburg, West Virginia on August 11, 1914. My father
                    was cashier of a smalltown bank. My mother was a housewife. I had two wonderful
                    parents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, so few had college educations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Neither one of them had a college education. As a matteof fact, I don't
                    believe my mother had gone through high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was very much the pattern. What was Clarksburg
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Clarksburg was a small southern town, very southern. As a matter of
                    fact, we were the “hotbed of copperheads,” as we were referred to by the North.
                    My father was very much a southerner. My mother was from Pennsylvania, but her
                    grandfather had come from Culpeper, so her background was actually South. Her
                    mother was the loveliest little German lady you ever could imagine. Her father
                    lived in a town called Punksatawney, which was north of Pittsburgh.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well known for the groundhog.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. My grandfather was a hardworking young man. He farmed. He had a
                    farm outside of town. He worked very hard and he became Mr. Punksatawney, as a
                    matter of fact. He became president of the Punksatawney National Bank. He owned
                    saw mills and a few things of that nature. Mother was much more of a [homebody]
                    than [her father]. Going down to Clarksburg was a little bit of a shock, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your father? What was his family like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: My father's [family] were southerners way back. They had come over to
                    the United States, the first one that I know of, in about 1703. Two of them
                    became ship captains in Maryland. His father was born in what was then
                    Washington City. He went down to Tappahanock. They were basically just
                    hardworking people who were trying to get in through the Reconstruction
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a young boy, were you hearing stories about the South
                        being lost cause and all that? Is that what you grew up with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: To a certain degree, from my father, yes, but not a greadeal.</p>
                <p>Q: West Virginia, of course, had basically sided with the North.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Basically, the ownership of West Virginia was northern. It was
                    Cleveland, Philadelphia, and New York City. The people were basically
                    Southerners. West Virginia was about the poorest state in the Union at that
                    time. It was backwards and back woods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a young boy, you went to school in Clarksburg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I started school in Clarksburg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Clarksburg was in what area? Was it a mining area,
                        orchards, ofarming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: My grandfather had come from Tappahanock to that area and opened several
                    coal mines. These were pick and shovel mines. It was on the edge of Pittsburgh's
                    [anthracite] coal, which was extremely important and extended all up through
                    Pennsylvania. He died quite young.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>My father was at school and had to come back and go to work. He started as a
                    runner for a bank. Because there were no telephones, they had little boys that
                    carried messages back and forth. He started as a runner and worked up to
                    cashier.</p>
                <p>We were middle class or slightly less than middle class, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your early elementary education like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I went to school in Clarksburg until the fourth grade, at which time my
                    father was diagnosed tubercular. That meant breaking up the home. Mother and I
                    went back to the charity of my grandfather in Pennsylvania, so I got to know
                    Punksatawney pretty well, besides the groundhog.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were in Clarksburg, because of the mining interests... This was a
                    pretty difficult time. There were small labor movements. It was a pretty rough
                    crew, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: From my position as a child, I didn't see it. There was a section of it
                    called Pinikaneke, which was an original blackhand section in which much of the
                    present mafia grew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Italian miners. When you went to Punksatawney, was
                        youfather ill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: My father had to go to Ashland, North Carolina. We were in Punksatawney
                    for three years - and I mean poor. I went to school with holes in my shoes. We
                    were strictly at the charity of my grandfather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was school like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was a public school. When I first got there, when I as called on, I
                    stood up and said, “Yes, Ma'am. No, Ma'am.” I felt there was a little antipathy
                    towards me in the class from some of the boys. That evening, I had to fight Tony
                    Infantino. I whipped Tony Infantino and I took over that gang. The [group] has
                    never been the same since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the education at that school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, in retrospect, it was very poor to medium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your grandfather was a farmer at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FARLAND: He was part of the bank, a farmer, a coal operator, and a timber
                    operator. He was a big, tough man. I got whipped about once a day.</p>
                <p>Q: He didn't take kindly to...</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Oh, he took kindly, but I was always into something that caused a little
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I am an only child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there through the seventh grade then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I unfortunately during that period contracted rheumatic fever. I was in
                    bed three months. There was no medicine at that time. My mother and my
                    grandmother would make onion [poultices] and mustard [plasters]. I think we had
                    aspirin. That was about it. I'll be forever grateful to the school system. I
                    missed three months of school and they graduated me from the sixth grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you reading much as a young boy or did you have a
                        chance to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: This was one of the problems that I had with my grandfather. I read all
                    the time. He told my mother one time, “I don't know about Joseph. He is either
                    going to grow up to be a bum or a millionaire and I don't know which.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you involved at all by being a runner or
                        doinanything with your grandfather's enterprises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, I didn't do any particular work up there. I trapped muskrats. As far
                    as working, I didn't. My father came back and a local man decided that he ought
                    to come in and have his teeth looked at. Father said, “No. I've had my teeth
                    looked at a thousand times.” He said, “Come on in. It's not going to cost you
                    anything. We're friends.” Every tooth in his head was abscessed. He pulled his
                    teeth and he never was sick another day until about 10 days before he died. What
                    a lawsuit that would have been today!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes! How did your mother react to being under her
                        father?This must have been very difficult for her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was difficult, but Mother knew the problem and just hato do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Oh, yes. My father taught me to use my imagination. He taught me to
                    shoot for the stars. My mother taught me religion, to believe in God, to love
                    your fellow man, and to be friendly to your fellow man. She taught me
                    leadership, honesty, and faith [in your] job, and to work. She taught me work
                    ethic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't ask for anything better than that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had two wonderful parents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you read a lot, do you recall the sort of
                        things yowere reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I read everything. I read “Tom Swift,” “Tarzan,” etc. I got very much
                    interested in history. I would read whatever I could find at the local small
                    library there in Punksatawney. I have been an avid reader all my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After there years in Punksatawney...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I came back. My father during that time had no job, no social security,
                    no income. When I say we were POOR, I mean POOR. That's spelled with capital
                    letters. We came back to a job in the bank. Mother worked. It was tough. He then
                    became cashier in another bank in Wheeling, West Virginia. At that time, I was
                    being told my job was to get through high school and to get the best education I
                    could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were going to high school in Wheeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I went to high school in Clarksburg. I trapped muskrats. I would get up
                    at four o'clock in the morning and run my trap lines. I made enough money to pay
                    my tuition for my first year in college.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school in Clarksburg, what sort of courses were
                        yotaking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I took preparatory courses. I was lousy in Latin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Welcome to the club.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was very proud of my last report card. I had two 98s, a 95, a 94, and
                    a 90. My parents were very happy. I was debating an oratory. This was during the
                    Depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was right in the middle of the Depression. I graduated in 1932 from
                    high school. My high school class dissolved instantly because those that could
                    find jobs, got them. The others went out looking for them. The ones who were
                    going to school left. The day that I was to go, I woke up with an appendicitis.
                    I ended up in the hospital having my appendix removed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was quite dangerous in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes, it was. Appendicitis before that was almost a death sentence. I had
                    no money to go to school then and I couldn't get a job. I was going to be a
                    doctor. From the time I was a little kid, I was going to be a doctor. Across the
                    street from me was a friend of Herbert Stein. Her name was Oldman. Down the
                    street from her lived Mrs. Stottler, who was a photographer for the Navy. They
                    wanted a male mind to mold. During the time between then and when I started
                    school in the second term, I read a book and a half a day under their
                    supervision and made a test at the end of each week. One week it would be
                    ancient history. One week it would be astronomy. One week it would be whatever.
                    They changed my mind from medicine to law and broke my mother's heart. That
                    changed my whole life.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Mrs. Stottler was a housewife who I must say did not maintain a very
                    neat home. She had books stacked to the ceiling. Her husband worked at [West
                    Virginia] Natural Gas. They had a big store there in town. She had few friends
                    that could equate with her mental capacity. They were looking for something to
                    do, both of them.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? If you were going to be a doctor,
                        theyour mother and father must have been pushing you to go on to
                        college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Oh, yes, definitely. Their whole basis of living was tget me through
                    college. I had to justify their faith.</p>
                <p>Q: In West Virginia, in Clarksburg, by the time you were getting ready to get out
                    of high school, we're talking about the depth of the Depression. West Virginia
                    was number 48 of the 48 states. That must have been a very-</p>
                <p>FARLAND: There was nothing. The other states didn't realize that West Virginia
                    had little dirt roads back in the country. I well remember getting stuck and
                    having to get a farmer with a team ohorses to pull us out when I was just a kid.
                    It was very backwards. West Virginia University at that time... They called me
                    back one time to give me a doctorate and there were more graduate students there
                    than there were when I was there as a student. There were only 3,200 students
                    there at the state university when I first went there. It was poor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the University, when you first went there, you started
                        therwhen, in 1932?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I started in January of 1933.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there such a thing as a pre-law course or were you
                        justaking general courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: You had to begin with a nightly course. They had a combined course. You
                    would graduate from law school in six years - three and three, in other
                    words.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In West Virginia and your family, how did they look upon
                        the NeDeal and Franklin Roosevelt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FARLAND: They both were democrats. My grandfather Simpson was a democrat from
                    Pennsylvania. My mother and father were both democrats. They had a hard time
                    understanding why I would be a republican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you start feeling republican?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: When I saw the Russians walking down the streets of Seoul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was some time in the future.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. Did the New Deal make any impression in West Virginiat this
                    time?</p>
                <p>I think it made a big impression in West Virginia. I know it did to me. I thought
                    Roosevelt was a great, great man. In retrospect, if he weren't stopped in their
                    terms, he would have been even greater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did politics intrude while you were young at the
                        universitin West Virginia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Not particularly, although I made one basic mistake. I was going to run
                    for president of the student body on a non-fraternity ticket. I decided that my
                    future would be benefitted by being a fraternity man, which made no sense to me
                    at all later in life, but at the time. I would have been elected president of
                    the student body at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of these things can seem so important at the

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, that was a major mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your courses were what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Political science and economics. My major was politicascience. I minored
                    in economics.</p>
                <p>Q: Did foreign affairs intrude at all?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Only in a way almost outside the university. I had some professors...
                    One professors for instance, had four or five of us to dinner one night and
                    said, “Hitler has already lost the war.” Of course, at that point, Hitler was
                    winning.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: That's true, but he was already moving. This may have been after I was
                    out of college. I'm not sure about that. That impressed the heck out of me. This
                    man said it. I'm not sure of the exact timing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: There were a few exchange students. I knew one boy in law school who was
                    there from Germany - obviously handpicked for some reason or other - and some
                    others. But West Virginia was pretty much in the backwater.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: I got out in 1938. I took law. I have a doctor's degrein law.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: Well, I worked two summers in Wheeling. One I had [over] 100-some
                    titles. The other summer I did general cleanup work of any kind, all of which I
                    was paid the [munificent] sum of nothing. “You are getting experience, lad,
                    you're getting experience. Be grateful.” I was grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any part time job when you were going to

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I came back from the first year in college and got a job as a
                    construction worker and proceeded to get a hernia forthwith. There was no
                    workman's compensation. That turned out to be more expensive. That didn't
                    help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out in 1938, did you go right into a law
                        firm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I started to work as special prosecuting attorney in Wheeling, West
                    Virginia, which was a big title with very little work. I wasn't appreciative of
                    that and decided with two other fellows in my law class to open our own firm
                    back in Morgantown, which we did. Then the war hit and they were both Reserve
                    officers. Away they went. My decision was what I should do. I had more knowledge
                    about mining.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you pick that up?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Both of my grandfathers were coal operators. It just was natural. Any
                    time I was around the coal mine, I was into something. I'm fascinated by it. I
                    knew that the German saboteurs wanted to disable our coal industry. I knew that
                    very few boys who had what little background I had in coal mining. So, I was in
                    Washington and I went and had an interview with the FBI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 1941 or 1942?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I told them very forthrightly that when I was in college, had been
                    recruited into the Communist Party of the United States.</p>
                <p>

                <p>FARLAND: What a wonderful place, the poorest place in the world. The miners were
                    in revolt. They had machine gunned a bridge along the [nearby] river. One of the
                    teachers was very smooth about it and invited four of us to have a free meal. A
                    free meal at that time was very important. The next free meal, she started to
                    discuss her political views and forms of government and so forth. Then she
                    advised us all to go to meetings at Martin Hall every Sunday at 11 o'clock. I
                    went four times and I said, “The hell with these apples. I don't like what I'm
                    hearing.” That ended my entire activity with the Communist Party of America. One
                    of the boys became a top officer in the national party. The other two just went
                    by the wayside.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I didn't take a pledge, if that's what you mean. I don't think she asked
                    any of us to do that.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: “Pity. We're delighted. You can better serve us.” Thawas my only

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you actually join the FBI then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I became a special agent for the Federal Bureau oInvestigation.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: Well, the training was intense and I mean intense. They would come in
                    and say, “This normally is a three month course and we're going to have to do it
                    in three days” or words to that effect. The toughest fellow in the class fell by
                    the wayside. He couldn't take it. It was tough.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: Fingerprinting to maintaining the authenticity of evidence to
                    wiretapping (in which I became particularly fluent and did a lot of) to
                    surveillance, the whole works.</p>

                    specialized in anything. I went from there to another posting and started
                    getting into wiretapping and more involved matters, including... I was finally
                    at that point picked to be one of the very select group of individuals who could
                    only talk to a select few in the office. It was a secret organization within a
                    secret organization. Our job was the protection of the atomic bomb, which I knew
                    was under construction.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was moved around a great deal. Q: Were you aware of what you were
                    protecting?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I knew exactly what I was protecting and I knew that we had minor
                    problems with Germans and major problems with the Russians. That is where the
                    basic anti-effort that we were undertaking was based.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well were we made known of the Soviet attempts to
                        penetrate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did we have lists of people who were considered to be Soviet agents?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: These were being developed over time by the normal means of
                    identification. We did some very interesting work, I might add, without going
                    into detail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you go into any detail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I can't on this.</p>
                <p>Q: Alright. During the war, it must have been difficult in a way that the Soviets
                    were our allies, yet at the same time, here we were concerned about them.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Very much so. Our investigation had to be premised oshaking their
                    [verbal] statements. Some of it was on other bases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, were you feeling
                        hidirection in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Very much so. This was our biggest effort.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you aware of the problem that we had some major figures who were both
                    excellent nuclear physicists and attached to the Communist Party? This was hard
                    to figure out. I mean, you win on one side and lose on the other.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had one client who was a very, very brilliant man, a college
                    professor. His affiliation was totally with the Russians.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling as you watched this? Was it a matter
                        omore or less reporting or was action being taken that you were aware
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: We had to stop what we could. I'm not sure I exactlunderstand what you
                    mean.</p>
                <p>Q: What I am saying is, there is one thing about reporting this activity as going
                    on. There is another thing about either removing somebody from the job,
                    arresting them, and foiling them, doing something like that.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: That aspect was out of my hands. Our work was to get the information as
                    to who was who and who was doing what to whom and how they were doing it and
                    where they were located.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this what you were doing basically during the
                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, it reached a point where in 1944 I had a cousin who was an
                    admiral. We had several long talks. I reached a point where I can't take very
                    many more criticisms of “Why aren't you in the Army? Why aren't you in the Navy?
                    Why are you a civilian?” I finally said to my wife, “I've got to join the Navy.”
                    She said, “If that's what you want, that's what you do,” so I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you joined in 1944.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you get your training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: In Blacksburg, New York. I'll never forget Blacksburg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get in during the winter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, it was something. Then, I asked for submarine duty. Being a coal
                    miner, I wanted a sub. I thought that would be the greatest thing in the world.
                    After Blacksburg, I was sent to Princeton University. We listened to all of
                    these lectures on how, why, and when we were going to invade Taiwan. Every
                    bartender on the East Coast knew that we were going. We had admirals, captains,
                    commanders, even someone as lowly as I. Our last lecture was given by a young
                    lieutenant who did a superb job at lecturing. He ended up with a few remarks on
                    Okinawa, including the number of prostitutes in the city. I walked out of there
                    and said to my buddy, “Taiwan, no. Okinawa. We've been sitting ducks.” We were a
                    decoy set up purposely, the biggest charade that you can imagine and I didn't
                    like it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, where else do you think they would send me? To Stanford. I started
                    to get some things that I could use in the future. I got a complete and thorough
                    understanding of the Japanese, the background, culture, way of life. Then they
                    started making me look at [some] pictures: “Where are you in Tokyo at this
                    point?” So, by the time I got through that, after about two weeks, I could see a
                    picture and I knew how far it was to the police station, how far it was to the
                    railroad station, and so forth. So, I learned all that and then they sent us
                    overseas and we went to Tokyo/Naha, where I was trained to go. I went to Seoul,
                    Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when? Was the war over by this time? FARLAND: The
                        war had just ended.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Korea like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was a desperately poor, sad country at that point. Iwas pathetically
                    poor. It was worse than West Virginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Seoul from when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was sent down to Suncha. I was supposed to be in command of the town
                    of Yosu, which was a port that was being constructed there at the end of the
                    railroad and went up to the coal fields of the north. Things were a mess there
                    at that point. Everybody had one thought in mind and that was to go home. I was
                    sent back up to Seoul and had the great title I told you about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the title?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>FARLAND: Navy liaison to the military government forces of Korea. I had my orders
                    to go home, but then I told my commanding officer, who was a captain, a fellow
                    with about 50 other field officers, and he said, “You can't go. Who is going to
                    take care of me?” I said, “Captain, if you can't amend my orders, my advice to
                    you is not to go out on the streets of Seoul at night.” I turned on my heels and
                    walked out. I decided that I had better get the heck out of there and get in a
                    boat. Otherwise, I may be in Leavenworth. The only reason I'm telling you that
                    now is that I'm sure the statute of limitations is run out on that one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the Koreans while you were
                        in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had a good friend [who] was such a nice fellow. These were a few that
                    I talked to in Japanese or some of them knew a little English. There were a few
                    Roman Catholics over there who stayed during the war, nuns and the like. They
                    were all real people. I liked their industry. I liked the way they worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Korea when, around 1946?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I went back home. My two partners, one of them said that he didn't want
                    to practice law; he wanted to teach. He was offered a job as a law professor at
                    Boston College. He had accepted it. So, he was gone. The other one said he was
                    interested in politics. It suddenly became apparent that there was virtually no
                    business in town. I had been gone for then better than four years. I had to make
                    some money. So, I started in the path of my grandfathers. I started a timber
                    company, which did very well. I started an insurance company. I went into the
                    coal business.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I'm getting tired.</p>

                <p>Today is February 1, 2000. You say you started an insurance business. How the
                    hell does one start an insurance business?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, you get a license. I didn't buy a company, but I got a license and
                    my wife got a license. We started in and made a pretty successful business out
                    of it. My wife did most of the work; I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In coal mining, did you buy auctions or property or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, my first real effort was the purchase of a mine in Shimston, West
                    Virginia, which was operating in the Pittsburgh Seam. It was being operated by
                    absentee owners who knew nothing about mining. They were producing (and this may
                    mean nothing to you) 10 tons per day per man on the payroll (That's everybody.).
                    I, a lawyer with a doctor's degree in law, took it over. In six months, I was
                    producing 20 tons per man. They were breaking even. Obviously, I was making
                    money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it plain management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Management, very definitely. I learned in the course of activity that
                    there is a big difference between management and labor. At the end of my
                    operations, I tried to sell to the key people the remainder of the mine so that
                    they could get a chance to make some real money before they retired. In one
                    instance, these key people who were making money at this one mine for the
                    operator turned around, raised their salary, took an extra day off, decided they
                    would even steal some coal that was not theirs, and I had to come back and get
                    them straightened out on that. The others, with one of their operations did
                    pretty well. Management is so important.</p>
                <p>Q: One always hears about the coal miners of West Virginia being a very tough
                    crew and just plain difficult. Did you find this to be true or not?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I like people. This has been a trademark of mine. My mother taught me
                    that basic Christian principles, Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself, and I liked
                    people. I intuitively like people. I liked the coal miners and they liked me.
                    They liked the fact that I put on hardhat, put on my light, rode in a mantrip
                    with them, stayed in with them, ate with them, showed them what I thought they
                    should be doing, cuss them out, enjoyed their company, listened to their jokes,
                    and went to the union meetings. They liked me. I liked them. That was my basis
                    of management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started this when, about 1947 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>FARLAND: That was about the end of it, I think. This has been a long time ago
                    now. I was young. If I hadn't been so young and audacious, I doubt if I would
                    have taken on this. After I took over this one mine along with the help of some
                    other people financially, John L. Lewis called a nationwide strike. There I was,
                    sitting. I called the men together and said, “Look, I have enough money to pay
                    you for two weeks. If this strike goes beyond two weeks, I'm through, and so are
                    you at this mine.” It was over within that period. I'm happy to say that I
                    succeeded. I never had [labor troubles] after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing both the insurance business and
                        mining, weryou in the lumber business, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was on the wrong story about how I got into it. An old wood [chopper]
                    from the mountains was sitting out in front of the courthouse square. He came in
                    and had a speech impediment. He was also wearing a World War I coat. I don't
                    think he had had a bath in six weeks or six years. He said, “Mr. Farland, I have
                    been sitting out there in the cold. I figured that you didn't have anything to
                    do (and he was right about that). How about just come up and talk to you?” We
                    talked for a while and he left and I aired the place out. He came back in about
                    two weeks. He said, “Mr. Farland, I've got an idea. I've got a lot of friends
                    who have their own saw mills. I like you and I think you like me. I'm sure
                    you'll like these guys. They'll bring you timber. All you have to do is just
                    merchandise it. Get rid of the coal mines and so forth. You could make a little
                    money.” I did. That is the way the timber company got started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a little feeling, you were involved then in

                <p>FARLAND: I was also in banking.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting involved at all in politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Not particularly, no. I was interested in politics, but I didn't take an
                    active part in politics. When Eisenhower ran for office, I made some effort to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you sort of move on to the scene which would lead

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FARLAND: In the early 1950s, all the mines were working out. We were reaching a
                    point where a big operation was no longer tenable. To be perfectly frank, I
                    thought I had made enough money to support my family for the rest of my life. I
                    wanted to do more. I wanted to do something for my country. This was a sincere
                    motive that I had. What I had read about other men's lives, I felt I was too
                    young just to quit, so I had the opportunity of an introduction to Herbert
                    Hoover, Jr., who was then Under Secretary of State. I went in to see him and I
                    said, “Is there anything in the State Department that I can do to be of
                    assistance to you and to my country?” He said, “I'll let you know in a couple of
                    weeks.” He called me in in a couple of weeks and said, “There is. This place is
                    so big and it is so complicated and there is so much going on. I'm not getting
                    all the word that I should. With your background, I want you in a position to
                    attend every staff meeting and report back to me what you think is going
                    on.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: 1955, I would say. Hoover was number two and John FosteDulles was
                    Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your title?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Assistant Counsel to UMSA (Under Secretary for MutuaSecurity
                    Affairs).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the State Department when you
                        firsarrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I couldn't believe... I thought to myself, “I could sit here in this
                    chair for a year and no one would call and I wouldn't do anything except get a
                    paycheck.” I went down and had some coffee in the cafeteria with some fellows
                    and they were talking about, “Well, I think we should have given them 10. I
                    thought we should give them 20.” I said, “What are you fellows talking about,
                    thousands?” “No, we're talking about millions.” This threw me. I couldn't quite
                    understand that. These fellows had never met a payroll. They never had to say,
                    “I no longer need you. You're fired.” Try that sometime. It hurts, especially
                    when they're competent men. I took it upon myself to get acquainted. I decided
                    that one possible way of getting acquainted was the old girls network. You've
                    heard about the old boys network, but there is an old girls network. I made
                    friends with a lot of the old girls there in the Department and they told me
                    what was going on.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: No, I'm talking about gals in charge of... One, for instance, who was in
                    charge of sending out furniture and so forth to embassies. She knew everything
                    that was going on in every embassy. Others that were in various and sundry posts
                    or positions gave me access to a lot of information. I made a lot of friends in
                    the State Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mutual Security Agency, that was what later became AID,

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Mutual Security Agency did what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was concerned with the assistance to foreign countries, not in the
                    form of aid, but in the form of other support (military aid and basic financial
                    loans, etc.).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were decisions made? Did you find it was done in

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Normally, they were made in the area meetings, but usuallthe decision
                    was made before that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, my job again was to get the facts and get an understanding of what
                    was going on and get as much information as I could.</p>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>FARLAND: He was delighted to get it. I did that for the better part of a year. I
                    was in the Department. He called me in one day and said, “Joe, you and one other
                    man came down here out of the 100-some people who approached me and offered to
                    do a [job for me] that was necessary. Now I want you to be an ambassador. I want
                    you to go, if you're interested, to Paraguay.” I said, “I will talk to my wife.
                    She is my partner.” He called me in about a week later and said, “Joe, I want to
                    be very careful in saying this because there is no hyperbole in it whatsoever.
                    We've assigned you to Paraguay if you want it. We have another post that is
                    exploding on us. It's extremely dangerous. As a matter of fact, it might cost
                    you your life. I want you to know that before you go any further. This is the
                    Dominican Republic and the era of Trujillo. We are terribly concerned about
                    what's been going on. There's been a kidnaping in New York. From the reports
                    we're getting, there is further activity that we should be concerned about.
                    Would you be interested?” I said, “I had better again talk to my wife.” She
                    said, “If that's what you want to do, that's what we will do.” So, that is what
                    I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Dominican Republic from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I went there in August of 1957. I left in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you told before you went out to the Dominican
                        Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: This was one reason why I stopped that other interview. I didn't want to
                    get into this. I was told “You are to go down to the Dominican Republic. You are
                    to be friendly with Trujillo, outwardly a close associate of Trujillo, as
                    another ambassador has been, but I want you to get into the underground and find
                    out what is going on and what is going to happen at this time and in the future.
                    It's a delicate operation, but your background and training makes you the best
                    possible selection we have in the Department. We do not want to eliminate
                    Trujillo. In other words, assassinate him. But we want him to take his loot and
                    go off to Estoril or some other place and leave those people alone, let them be
                    free.” We've been accused of wanting to assassinate Trujillo. That was not my
                    assignment. That would have been easy. What I had to do was try to convince them
                    to get the hell out of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we so concerned in 1957 about the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, human rights for one reason, definitely. There was an American
                    citizen, a man by the name of Galinda, kidnaped on the streets of New York,
                    flown to Miami, flown to the Dominican Republic, and killed. Part of my job was
                    to find out the truth of that story. It was true. I found that out definitely.
                    He was murdered in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was a Spaniard who had been a tutor for Ramphas and Rademus,
                    Trujillo's two sons. He left, went to Columbia University and was teaching at
                    Columbia, was picked up off the street by Arturas Beyat's organization (He was
                    then consul general in New York.) and flown to Miami and subsequently killed.
                    One of the pilots on that plane was a man by the name of Adel Masa, who
                    presumably hanged himself in a jail cell, but the fact was he was murdered by
                    Trujillo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Galinda doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He wrote a biography of Trujillo. I've never seen it. There supposedly
                    is a copy. Trujillo did everything in his power to eliminate every copy. I have
                    been told (I can't verify this for a fact, but I have a pretty good idea it's
                    true.) that Ramphas came in the seat of a cabana when Trujillo's mistress in a
                    period of spite departs for Cuba and shacks up with Galinda. If that is in
                    there, he would certainly kill anyone. That is what I heard was in that
                    book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in the Dominican Republic when you went
                        outhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Trujillo was in complete control. He was eliminating his opponents.
                    Murder was in style. It was completely amoral. I want to go back a ways. Before
                    I left Morgantown, I did what I consider my greatest contribution in life. I
                    built a church. I worked terribly hard. I would put on my miner's clothes and go
                    up there in the morning to raise the dickens with the workmen to do a little
                    better, do a little faster. The architect was the architect of the National
                    Cathedral in Washington. He was a great artist and a very poor businessman. We
                    had to fight with him all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an Episcopal church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. We built that church. The architect originally said we could build
                    a church, a rectory, and a hall for $160,000. Remember, this was right after the
                    war. Inflation had not set in. We didn't get plans for about two years.
                    Inflation was going up at about 10% per annum at least. We broke ground with
                    only the floorplan. I was determined to get that church built. I had come back
                    from Korea believing even more fervently in God and I wanted to do that in His
                    great honor and for our people of the town, so I did. I was chairman of the
                    building committee. Everyone had suggestions.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>We have to go back. When I got to the Dominican Republic, I found that there was
                    no priest or rector in the Episcopal church in Ciudad Trujillo. He had been
                    killed at the crossing by Trujillo, murdered. I preached for a year and a half
                    along with Ambassador McGinney, the British ambassador. We got that church
                    together. Did the Lord have anything to do with sending me to the Dominican
                    Republic? That's anybody's guess. But I took that church and we finally got a
                    rector and [put it into] operation again. When I got there, it was shut down.
                    But I always add, every time I preached, there were two men in the back of the
                    church wearing [overcoats] and carrying a .38 underneath them, listening to what
                    the ambassador had to say from the pulpit.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you went out there, one of the things I've heard is that, like Somoza,
                    Trujillo had his almost pet congressmen. Can you talk about this?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I can talk about it, but I'm not going to name names. Q: I think the
                    names have been named before.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Mano Namoya was the Dominican ambassador to the United States. He was a
                    very good looking, suave, socially correct individual. He loved all the women in
                    town. Mano had a love nest just outside of the city that you entered by a maze
                    of hedges so no car could be observed. It was totally wired. There were two way
                    mirrors. There was a supply of whatever one wanted in the way of your desire. A
                    number of our congressmen made use of that and were photographed and taped. I
                    had one senator come down and I said, “Senator, I and my country team are
                    prepared to brief you.” He said, “I know all I want to know about this damn
                    country. All I want from you is to make diddly darn sure that I'm well supplied
                    with liquor in my hotel room for a week. I don't want to see you during that
                    period of time.” Can an ambassador report that at the time? No. That's only one
                    instance. I know of several.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting from congressmen and senators before you
                        wenout “Be extra nice to Trujillo” or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, no. I was being extra nice to Trujillo.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting warnings from the Department of State, from the desk or
                    something, telling you “We've got to be extra careful because of congressional
                    or senatorial interest in this?”</p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, I cant say that I did. I was getting from Trujillo, for instance,
                    his entire take on the intelligence situation in Cuba and I was reporting that.
                    One day, I got a lovely telegram saying “Pay more attention to your client and
                    less to Batista,” which I thought was stupid.” That was the best source of
                    information we had.</p>
                <p>Q: At that point, Batista was giving information to Trujillo?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>FARLAND: No, Trujillo was getting information in Cuba from his own sources. No,
                    they weren't the best of friends because Batista owed Trujillo money for some
                    weapons he had supplied. Trujillo had a mine factory at San Cristobal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, I was not. The briefing I got was primarily from... Only three
                    people knew my new assignment. Stuart, this is important. This is why I kept it
                    so tight. John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Herbert Hoover were the only men
                    who knew my assignment to the Dominican Republic, what I was to do and why I was
                    doing it.</p>
                <p>Q: This is normally the job of the CIA station chief in the Dominican Republic.
                    When you arrived there, who was it and how did it work?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I think his name was Reed, but I'm not sure about that. One day, he came
                    to me and said, “Mr. Ambassador, I hate to bother you, but I've locked myself
                    out of my office.” I said, “You what?” He said, “I've locked myself out of my
                    office.” I took him by the hand and we went back. I picked the lock and opened
                    it up and said, “Please, I have other things to do besides get you in your
                    office. Please be more careful.”</p>

                <p>FARLAND: This was my old FBI training, that's right. Secondly, we had a character
                    come down who was a code clerk. After he had been there for about three weeks,
                    he came rushing in and told the political officer that his room at the hotel had
                    been ransacked. Everything had been gone through. His life obviously was in
                    danger. He wanted out of the Dominican Republic. So, I called the CIA and said,
                    “Go question this fellow. See what the heck is going on.” They came back in and
                    said, “Well, Mr. Ambassador, the room is really torn up. Do you know what? They
                    even went so far as to take this man's portable radio and carefully unscrew the
                    back and take it off and look inside and see if there was any kind of a
                    transmitter in it.” I said, “They did what?” He said, “Just exactly what I
                    said.” I said, “You go back and talk to that young man and really talk to him
                    like a Dutch uncle. He's lying.” He came back and said, “Yes, he was lying. He
                    had done it.” Perfectly obvious. If they had torn up the room, why wouldn't they
                    have been so careful and unscrew the back of his particular piece of
                    property.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he just wanted out of there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>FARLAND: He wanted out of there. Besides, he had sexual proclivities that are
                    unusual. He felt that he wasn't safe in that place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I take it that you didn't feel you were terribly
                        welsupported by the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That fellow was called out of there and another man by the name of Smith
                    came in and was much better and did a competent job. Later, Reed was the last
                    agent there who made some contacts with various sundry people. Stuart, I had to
                    operate on my own. I had a DCM who was definitely in the pocket of Trujillo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He has a son and he's no longer living. I don't want to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. But when you came there, did you find an embassy
                        more oless that was sort of in the pocket of Trujillo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, the DCM was accepting gifts. The stupid character, he even told me
                    he had spent some time in Mano Demoyo's love house. I had to go back to
                    Washington. Do you realize, for a political appointee to get a Foreign Service
                    officer kicked out is quite an undertaking. I undertook it because I had to. I
                    couldn't carry out my job with him there. Everything I was doing when I would go
                    on leave, he would try to negate. So, out he went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who took his place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: One of the best officers I've ever had contact with. You interviewed
                    him. He didn't talk too much about that particular phase of it. He was there
                    afterwards. Henry Dearborn, a great, great man, superb. I couldn't recommend him
                    more. He and John Barfield, who was a political officer. I had one political
                    officer there, Robert Allen. He hated my insides. He thought I was a devotee of
                    Trujillo. John was more perceptive, although I never discussed it with John
                    until towards the end when Dearborn had come in and it was pretty obvious that I
                    was leaving.</p>
                <p>Q: The normal embassy goes out and reports on what's happening. Here you were in
                    a country where you had a dictator who was doing nasty things all over the
                    place. Was this a steady source of reporting? Had this been?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>FARLAND: It had been reported. John Barfield was a highly competent political
                    reporter and did some beautiful work in reporting. Allen also was a great
                    reporter. Allen was totally on the side of the underground, so he was getting
                    information that was invaluable also, but he [didn't have the opportunity] to
                    report it. The DCM would cut him out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Trujillo and your overt relations with
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: We were great friends for a while.</p>
                <p>Q: Was this his style, to make nice to the American ambassador?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Very much so. We were the virtual country... And, of course, the first
                    Christmas, my wife receives from Tiffany's a beautiful, beautiful tea set, which
                    I returned with deep appreciation and a full explanation that American
                    ambassadors aren't supposed to do this sort of thing and we don't let them do
                    it, but that it was deeply appreciated and the kindness shall long be
                    remembered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing with him personally? Did you get
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had lunch with him. He spoke a lot of English and my Spanish was not
                    what you would call fluent. But I could speak a little. But the two of us
                    understood what we were saying. He understood English perfectly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: For one thing, I told him that the Azamo River was full of mud every
                    day, which meant that the campesinos were cutting down and burning back in the
                    mountains and that that should be stopped. They had to keep the topsoil.
                    Remember, I'm from West Virginia. I said, “That topsoil is the most valuable
                    thing you have here.” Then, of course, there was coal. They had an operation
                    there of bauxite. They had a pretty big operation over in Santiago in cigars and
                    the like, a local operation. They made some good cigars over there. I wouldn't
                    smoke them, but they do.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>He asked me one time, “How will I protect myself against assassination?” I said,
                    “It's almost impossible.” He said, “Well, first, can you tell me how it might be
                    done?” So, with the imagination that my father impressed me with, I said, “Well,
                    it would be very simple and no one would no why. Just get a piece of uranium
                    when you had your shoes made in the States or in England. Have a little piece of
                    it put in your shoe and you put it on every morning and pretty soon you'll be
                    dead.” He had a rather dark [expresion]. He turned white. He asked me, “Where do
                    I get those shoes?” Then he said, “You should be the head of the CIA.” I said,
                    “I don't think that's the job for me. I'm satisfied where I am.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we giving him any help, assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: A little, but it was rapidly going downhill. One of the rough things
                    was, we cut off special compensation on sugar. He would buy armament. France was
                    the principal supplier of armament to him. The United States got credit for it,
                    but it was France who was doing it. One of the rough things was we cut off
                    special compensation on sugar. To come up abruptly to this [time] to a period in
                    1960, I went down to tell him that all military equipment, every ounce of
                    military equipment, was stopped. I went all by myself. He had his ambassador to
                    the United States, the head of the army, the head of the navy, and the head of
                    the air force standing there at attention. He blew up. He turned red. He
                    proceeded then to do the unmentionable. He began a tirade against Eisenhower, my
                    president. He called him “Stupid,” said that he didn't understand politics,
                    didn't understand what was going on in the Caribbean, and he called him (I hate
                    to say this on tape.) a “son of a bitch.” When he did that, my diplomacy took a
                    flight out and I was a coal miner again. I decided the time had come when I
                    would have to say a few words in support of my country, which I did, ending up
                    by saying “As far as you are concerned, in my estimation, you're nothing but a
                    two bit dictator and your country compared to mine is nothing but a fly speck on
                    a map.” He turned redder than anything in this room. I suddenly realized, “Old
                    Joe, if you blink, you're dead. I'm all by myself. He's wearing a gun. He has
                    four million here who will support him. I'm a dead man if I blink.” But I didn't
                    blink. He blinked. He came walking around the corner of the desk and said, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, my friend, in moments of stress, we oftentimes make comments that we
                    really don't mean. Let's forgive and forget.” I couldn't help myself. I said,
                    “Trujillo, I am a Christian. I will forgive, but I won't forget.” I turned on my
                    heel and walked what looked like 24 miles across that office, all the time
                    wondering if I was going to get a .38 in my back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had caused this cutting off of everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>FARLAND: My reporting on what he was doing. I had previously gone to see his
                    older daughter. I drove out there in a Volkswagen that I had. I said, “Flora,
                    I've come to talk to you about your father.” She said, “Why talk to me?” I said,
                    “Flora, you're the only one that I can talk to who has the guts to tell him what
                    I'm going to tell you. Your father is going to be assassinated. There is no
                    question in my mind whatsoever about that. It's not the purpose of the United
                    States to have that happen. We want him to retire and leave this country and let
                    it become a normal way of life here in the Dominican Republic, which it can.
                    This is a great country.” She said, “I know that.” Later in an article, she said
                    I was the only ambassador that the United States ever had there who wouldn't
                    lick Trujillo's boots. Then, at a party about five days later, she arrived at
                    the party and said, “I talked to Daddy.” I said, “What did he say?” She said,
                    “The ambassador said that? Yuck!” I said, “That's the end.”</p>
                <p>Q: He had been killing people and all. Was there an organized group or was it
                    just that you felt that somebody whose son had been killed by Trujillo's people
                    was going to end up by shooting them or something like that?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: My difficulty with their apparatus down there was that they had too many
                    people talking. They tried to set up what they called a “triumphal tree.” One
                    would know... But they didn't stick to it. They talked. This conversation is all
                    out of whack. I should have told you in the beginning when I got there what-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: When I got there, and the DCM had not told me, I didn't have an embassy.
                    I had an embassy residence. The roof was off of it. There was about two inches
                    of water on the parquet floors. We had no place to live. What was available was
                    [a hotel]. So, I had my wife, three kids and a baby, and a nurse who moved in.
                    The first thing I did was, I looked around to see what electric appliances could
                    be operated there. I figured I had better know. In every room, there was a
                    little radio arrangement whereby you could switch between four different
                    stations and then off. That is a direct [connection]. That can be turned into a
                    plug in every room. So, I made use of that. I would come home and tell my wife
                    what a great man Trujillo was, that what he was doing for this country was
                    superb, then go in the bathroom, turn on the water, flush the toilet, and
                    whisper what the truth was. This was an unusual type of operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You say part of your operation was to make contact
                        with thopposition. How did you work that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>FARLAND: The first party we had, I didn't know a soul. I didn't know who I could
                    depend on, the embassy's names. Also, Trujillo was very kind and provided me
                    with an aide de camp in navy uniform because I had been in the navy. He was
                    assigned to me and all I had to do was tell him what we needed or somebody
                    needed and he provided it. A real nice arrangement. I won't say anything more
                    about him, but he was more useful to me than he talked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Time has gone on. How could you use him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He is still alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how were you making contact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: At this first party, I didn't know anybody, but through shaking hands,
                    “Nice to see you,” and everybody was coming in and smiling... One person didn't
                    seem to be smiling as much as the others. Later on, I told my wife, “I think
                    I've found my contact” and I did. It was awfully hard. No one wanted to trust
                    the American ambassador, even the businessmen didn't.</p>
                <p>Q: How could you carry on these cordial relations? I'm talking about at the very
                    beginning in 1957. Cordial relations with Trujillo, which had been more or less
                    the pattern of other American ambassadors, at the same time convince people who
                    were opposed to him that we were not opposed to them...</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Very carefully. That was very difficult, believe me. That is why it took
                    so long. I had to do it individually. I couldn't tell anybody else what I was
                    doing. It was too dangerous.</p>
                <p>Q: When you're talking about somebody like Trujillo, there are obviously two ways
                    of dealing with it. One, to have him leave, just say, “Okay, I'll take my money
                    and go.” The other one was to get killed. I can't think of a single dictator who
                    actually left outside of... Maybe there was a mob outside the place and he goes
                    out the back door.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Batista left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he left because he was driven out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Esponia left Colombia. Peres Jimenez left Venezuela. Peron left... I had
                    met them all. They all came there. [It was a] dictator convention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with the underground, what message were we

                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>FARLAND: The first thing I had to establish was to get somebody to trust me. I
                    did a lot of hunting and fishing. I would get a man out in the field hunting and
                    I could ask him some casual questions that had a double meaning and find out his
                    feelings a little bit. I would indicate also that if the atmosphere was right,
                    mine. It took time. This was 1957 until Henry came in 1959. There was not a
                    great deal of movement except for me trying to sell myself and that was hard to
                    do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Bob left and I don't remember what the circumstance was.He was very much

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had a consul who was very close, but he also served a purpose because
                    I was finding out a lot from him that I couldn't from others. John was not close
                    to Trujillo. Allen most certainly wasn't. So, those two men were not playing
                    footsy with Trujillo. The DCM was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was a great guy, but he did not play too big a part in this. The head
                    of my military mission, did, however, in the course of events. As a matter of
                    fact, there was a period when in 1959 when they had an invasion from Cuba and
                    one by sea and a slight war broke out, which didn't amount to much, Trujillo's
                    army didn't prove [effective], but it did prove the campesinos would fight for
                    Trujillo. That is one thing it did prove. There is so much to tell. At that
                    point, I was pretty close to the underground. They had four or five of those
                    boys flown in from Cuba in a cellar someplace and they were losing their tan. I
                    flew over to Guantanamo and got a sunlamp. That is not exactly what an
                    ambassador normally does. By doing that, I ingratiated myself.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time, obviously, most of the revolutions against dictators usually end
                    of by being taken over by leftists just by the nature of politics. The
                    Eisenhower administration was responsible for the Jacobo Arbens in Guatemala
                    under Ambassador Peurifoy and the thought that he was probably too left wing,
                    which...</p>
                <p>FARLAND: That still had nothing to do with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Q: But that had been our pattern. I would think that we would be extremely
                    concerned that anybody who would take over the Dominican Republic would come out
                    of the fairly extreme part of the left.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, that is interesting. I cannot tell you the parties involved. Some
                    people are still alive and I'm not going to put their life in jeopardy. It may
                    be that Trujillo is someplace and wants to get even. I was asked by Dick Rhubarb
                    to supply him-</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right. To supply him with a list of the names of the people who
                    were [prepared] to take over the government once Trujillo was assassinated. I'm
                    not exaggerating. I put my life in jeopardy when I tried to get this - and the
                    individuals or individual in jeopardy to get it. But I surprised Dick with a
                    list of who would take over the government.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: This was “eyes only” to them. I hope they didn't, but they didn't know
                    my contact. I never mentioned that contact even today and I don't want to.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I felt there was a compromise in ARA. I'll tell you why. Let's just say
                    I like to hunt and fish and travel the interior a lot. It was a good cover for
                    me. During that period, I bumped into what was obviously an invasion fleet being
                    put together by Trujillo against Castro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Castro was still up in the hills.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>FARLAND: No, he was out of the hills by that time. This was right in the
                    beginning of the administration. There had been some diplomatic move by
                    organizations against Trujillo and Trujillo was organizing. He had the largest
                    standing army in the Caribbean, his own gun factory, and a few other things. I
                    see these boats and these men and I get back to the office and I think to
                    myself, “I don't want to report this. [You should] report only what you want the
                    State Department to know.” I sat on it for three or four days and thought, “If I
                    don't report this, somebody in this embassy is going to find out about this
                    whether it's through the Navy, the Marines, or whoever,” so I reported this. I
                    immediately got a telegram back from the Department: “See Trujillo once and
                    advise him that we look upon this with the greatest disrespect” or words to that
                    effect. I reported that. I went to the foreign office with it on Friday. I”m in
                    my office on Saturday or Sunday. The place was closed. A Marine came in and
                    said, “Sir, the foreign minister is here.” “Send him in.” His name was Perfurio
                    Herrera Baez. He walked in. I said, “Perfurio, you wanted to see me? I'm
                    supposed to come to see you.” He said, “I've just seen Trujillo and he wanted me
                    to stop and see you and tell you that the invasion is off. You can report that
                    to your government.” As far as I was concerned, I was very happy that the two of
                    them fought it out. Washington would get involved with that if Trujillo wanted
                    to take on Castro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of Ramphas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>FARLAND: That was my first problem of major consequence. Ramphas was invited to
                    attend the General Staff College of Leavenworth and no officer can go to
                    Leavenworth who is above the rank of colonel. So, Ramphas had to take off his
                    general uniform and put on a colonel's uniform and go to the College. He took
                    over a whole floor of the Mulhollend Hotel there. In no time, you find that he
                    puts on his general uniform. In no time, he decided “I don't have to attend
                    these classes. They're boring.” He got Mrs. Merriwether Post's “Seacloud,” now
                    called “The Anolita,” a beautiful sailing ship that is now being put back in
                    service, and sailed it through the Panama Canal as the warship of the Dominican
                    Republic, pays no toll, goes up to Hollywood and spends many a happy hour with
                    the starlets. He comes back eventually and graduation day comes and he leaves
                    and goes to the Republic. Now the question is, “Does he graduate?” This was the
                    son of Trujillo, the favorite son, the apple of his eye, Daddy's boy. I know
                    this went clear to Eisenhower. No graduation certificate. A certificate of
                    attendance. I take that down to the foreign office. I handed it to Perfurio. He
                    touches it with two fingers, scared to death. I said, “It's a great honor. You
                    know he's been ill and so forth.” Then, I got a call and talked to Trujillo. The
                    foreign office will send a car. I didn't like that. I'm traveling in a Dominican
                    car with a Dominican driver. We drove out to San Cristobal. There was Trujillo
                    with campesinos scraping and crawling around before him. He was there with his
                    campaign hat on. He's got on his holsters. I had to tell him that Ramphas did
                    not graduate, that he got a certificate of attendance. He said in English, “You
                    mean to tell me that my son did not graduate from the staff school at
                    Leavenworth?” So, I had to say, “Mr. Trujillo, you of all people understand that
                    when a man is ill, as your son has been, if the climate didn't agree with him,
                    he couldn't attend class. If he didn't attend class, there is a standard that
                    has to be maintained. You maintain the highest standard for your troops. The
                    United States does likewise. The fact that he couldn't attend, failed to attend
                    because of some illness, it did get him a certificate of attendance.” I thought
                    I was going to get shot. I really did. He was violently mad. Ramphas would
                    hardly speak to me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This “illness” was just your word for...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That was a euphemism. He wasn't ill. I made up something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Ramphas' role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was a general and he was in charge of the air force, but there was
                    another man who did the actual work. Ramphas was pretty much of a playboy. He
                    enjoyed that very much. Even after the assassination, he didn't take over really
                    the control of it. He didn't go to Johnny Abbis or to Espeyel and say “Kill them
                    all.” He wasn't a hands on operation.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>FARLAND: There was no one.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you able to raise the subject with Trujillo, saying “Why don't you go and
                    take your ill gotten gains (in a polite way) and live it out in Spain or
                    something?”</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Mark Clark came down there, which made me a little angry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was General Clark, now retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. He talked to Trujillo along that line. Trujillo submitted to him in
                    Spanish, so he had to send his paper over to him to be written in Spanish. It
                    was late in the evening and I carried it over to next door to the station there
                    before he got into his property. I stopped, at which point I had two submachine
                    guns stuck in my car. They didn't know who I was or what was going on. They
                    hadn't been forewarned. So, I made some general remarks about that at the time.
                    I gave them the paper and went over to the embassy and took off my shoes and
                    said, “I'm not going out again tonight.” The phone rang. A man called and said,
                    “Trujillo, here is what happened at the gate.” He said, “Oh, come on over and
                    have a drink.” “No thanks, I'm in for the night. I've had enough for one day.
                    Thank you very much. No thanks.” That was Mark Clark's end of that effort.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Nothing happened. [A family member' went] over and talked to him, which
                    I thought was the best possible... To have a member of his family tell him...
                    Nothing happened. I knew it was all over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Absolutely. I wrote to Dick Rubaum a letter. I spelled out 10 things
                    that I thought were going to happen. I would like to get a copy of that letter
                    if it's available. Those things happen. They happen by chance and sequence and
                    they ended up with the assassination of Trujillo within a year.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you seeing at the time, in this 1957-1960 period, a steady decline in the
                    control situation by Trujillo? Here is an absolute dictator. Were you expecting
                    that he would have to take even more extreme measures in order to keep control
                    or would an assassination just be a bolt out of the blue with no lead-up to it?
                    Did you see the situation of Trujillo's rule beginning to get tighter or more
                    difficult because of internal composition?</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>FARLAND: It was tighter because of the economics, the shutdown of this tax that
                    favored him (the sugar crop). He had been buying copiously anything he could get
                    from France, Czechoslovakia, wherever he could get it. Also, the day I left, at
                    the airport my last handshake with Henry Dearborn, he palmed a note to me which
                    indicated that Trujillo had told his officers to stay out of the Roman Catholic
                    Church. So, there was a break with the Church and that was one of his main
                    supporters. So, he was losing money and church. The United States had obviously
                    given up on him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The opposition came from those who were educated. These were lawyers,
                    doctors, engineers, top-flight merchants, people generally who had been trained
                    in the United States. Most of them spoke English.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Trujillo had a very interesting habit of saying that he liked sending
                    one of his minions to see Senor Gomez or Senor Jimenez and say, “Generalissimo
                    Trujillo thinks your daughter is very nice and would like for her to be out at
                    San Cristobal for the night,” at which point the recipient of that conversation
                    would say, “My house and home is greatly honored by the Generalissimo's interest
                    in my daughter.” Would you believe that?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it wasn't just a matter of military dictatorship. It

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: When he took over originally, he was doing fine for the first few years.
                    He was doing some excellent things. He got roads back into shape. He got
                    businesses restarted. They had a hell of a hurricane down there. But he got
                    surrounded by a bunch of sycophants, who wanted to feather their own nests. They
                    would tell him that if he burped, it was the greatest burp in history. Whatever
                    he did was the greatest that had ever been done. He could do no wrong. It was
                    laughable to an outsider, but he believed his own press agents.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the times you had to confront him, but in

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Oh, yes, he was rational. I had lunch with him a number of times. We
                    didn't do any heavy thinking during that conversation, but rational, yes, he
                    was. A man cannot live in that kind of a climate for 30-some years without
                    having something on the ball.</p>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>FARLAND: And we had some American businessmen who came there. Bell Polly was one.
                    This was a man who had an interest in Cuba at one time. He had his brother
                    signed over there to the Dominican Republic to look after his interests. There
                    were plenty of opportunities to make money there. I was offered one night, “Mr.
                    Ambassador, we've just issued some new stock at the abattoir. It costs very
                    little and I think there will be a lot of profit. Would you be interested in
                    having a few shares of that?” “No, Manuel, I've had to put my stocks all in
                    trust. That would just complicate things mightily if I got any other stock. I
                    would have to put that in trust and that would be too much of a complication.
                    Thank you very much though.” The cement plant was another. He had a lock on a
                    cement business. He had been locked on the abattoir. He also took 10% of all
                    profits. You give a man, for instance, the Jeep Agency. You have exclusive. I
                    want 10% minimum.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was sending it abroad for one thing. I don't know whahe did with it
                    all. Ramphas got a lot of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about his other children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Rademus, a couple of years ago, was saying that he was going to kill me.
                    I was the one that caused his father's death. There was enough substance to it
                    to justify me carrying a gun, which I did for another year. Rademus was not a
                    very bright boy. He got mixed up with the Medellin cartel in Colombia. He got a
                    nice shipment of cocaine and sells it and forgot to return the money to the
                    cartel. So, Rademus is no longer among the living. When I got there, he was
                    about 11 or 12 years old and he had a bevy of whores in one of the hotels for
                    the use of his friends and himself. It was amoral. It was unbelievable! As John
                    Barfield said to me one time, “If we write a book, people won't believe this. It
                    us so utterly amoral.”</p>
                <p>Q: I recall one time in prep school in the 1940s during the war, there was one
                    young man from the Dominican Republic at this school (I was not a fancy guy, but
                    there were some fancy people there.) who said he was a captain in the Dominican
                    army. This guy was about 14 years old. What the hell was this?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Ramphas was a colonel at 11. It was a different world.</p>
                <p>Q: Back to this contact with the underground. What were we doing except talking
                    to people? Were we saying “Go to it” or was it just for information?</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>FARLAND: My first effort was to try to get into the underground. My wife also
                    moved into the area. Towards the end, she was going to a book meeting every week
                    and exchanging books and brought back a book, in which there would immediately
                    be a message. They never did find that one out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what was our purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Our purpose was to ascertain exactly what was going thappen, when it was
                    going to happen, and who was going to take over.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your analysis of... You've got, if nothing else, an awful lot of
                    fathers and brothers getting a little tired of their sisters and daughters being
                    despoiled. This was a very likely source of assassins. If it happened, what did
                    we see moving in at that time?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I didn't see it happening that way. I saw the establishment of a
                    democratic government. I had the list of those who were going to be in it. As I
                    say, that almost cost me my life to get it. I had to go through a lot of
                    subterfuge and covers in order to make the contact and the contact had to become
                    somewhat obvious.</p>
                <p>Q: What were we doing? Were we talking to people who might supplant Trujillo
                    after his removal from the scene and saying “We will support a democratic
                    regime, but we will not support another dictatorship?” Was that our message?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, our message was that we would support the underground as we knew
                    them. Johnny Puccini, who was one of the wealthiest young men in town, asked me
                    one day, “We need 12 Enfield rifles.” I said, “Why in the hell do you want an
                    Enfield rifle?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A British army rifle, a rather elderly one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right. He said, “Well, we hear that they're the best.” I said,
                    “Well, I'll take it up, but I'm not going to guarantee it.” I mentioned it to
                    Dick. The Church committee asked me and I mentioned it to the Church committee.
                    I didn't expect him to get them. But if I didn't at least go back and say I
                    asked for them, how much confidence would the underground have in me? So, I had
                    to make some kind of a visual effort, so I did. But I didn't get them. They
                    arrived later. One boy said to me, “You know, you are right here. You look right
                    into Trujillo's bedroom. Why don't you shoot him?” I said, “Johnny, why don't
                    you shoot him? You went to military school in the United States. You know how to
                    shoot a rifle. Why do you want me to shoot him?” He said, “I want to go to the
                    funeral.”Q: With this effort, what support did we give while you were there to
                    the underground?</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>FARLAND: The support that I gave to the underground was the fact that they knew
                    that the United States would back a democratic government. I didn't give them a
                    diddly darn thing as far as weaponry is concerned or any kind of apparatus of
                    any kind. But they knew that I was on their side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there in 1960, how much longer was Trujillo
                        ipower?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was a little less than a year before he was killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in the air? Had there been other attempts on
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: There had been a couple. The day I left, Trujillo tried to do me in.
                    This is a complicated situation. John Barfield had a call from his counterpart
                    in another embassy saying “My ambassador is all upset. He wants to go with the
                    American ambassador to the airport, along with other members of the corps, and
                    he received an invitation from the Papal Nuncio that there would be a meeting at
                    the exact time that the ambassador is leaving to go to the airport, so he's got
                    to go to that meeting.” A few months later, someone came to the embassy with a
                    little present to me from a local organization. It was a little silver tray.
                    This individual was frightened to death and said to me, “Do you know who I am?”
                    The question was “Do you know I'm in the underground?” I said, “Yes, I know who
                    you are.” The individual said, “I've been told to tell you to be extremely
                    careful on the way to the airport.” And out the person went. I told Dearborn
                    what the situation was. I knew it couldn't be true because the night before, the
                    Papal Nuncio, not being able to come to a party that I was attending, sent me a
                    little painting of the Crucifixion, along with a note of his high regards. He
                    wasn't supporting Trujillo and we knew that. I knew this was a fake, but John
                    went up and was told there was no meeting, that that was not our invitation. It
                    was all printed with a seal and everything else. It looked official. So, what
                    actuallhappened, the whole corps said, “The hell with that” and they all went
                    with me to the airport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Washington, I assume you were debriefed
                        and yowere seeing people. What were you saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Most of what I've told you. But I was basically talking tDick Rubottom.
                    They were working on my next post, which was Panama.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we leave the Dominican Republic, during 1957-1960, what were relations
                    with Haiti like? This was the time of Papa Doc Duvalier. Were there much
                    relations there?</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>FARLAND: The Haitians sent a couple of delegations over to the Dominican Republic
                    and they were frightened to death. Papa Doc was scared to death of Trujillo and
                    justifiably so. I told you at another time before we started recording that one
                    day Trujillo killed between 30 and 40,000 Haitians and the Zone Sanitaire, which
                    was the borderline between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. He let them come
                    over to harvest his sugarcane, paid them 50 cents and as much sugar as they
                    could eat from the cane, really slave labor. So he made use of them when he
                    wanted to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Dominican army? How did we see that back at
                        thitime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: As far as the numbers were concerned, that was the largest standing army
                    in the Caribbean. They were well-equipped with everything that Trujillo could
                    buy. They had some tanks, though not many. They had a fairly good rifle that was
                    made near San Cristobal. They made pistols there also. As far as their fighting
                    ability, when that so-called invasion came from Cuba, they didn't purport
                    themselves too well, but the boys were all...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually, there are two sources. The enlisted men in these
                        armies come from the campesinos and the officer corps can either come from
                        the upper class or from the campesino class, but the brighter ones move up
                        through this and therefore owe their allegiance more to both the army and to
                        the dictator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That was Trujillo's case. He rose through the ranks when we sent Marines
                    in down there. He got his training from the United States Marine Corps. He was
                    very proud of that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to 1960. Let's get set up for Panama. You came
                        bacto Washington in the summer of 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I came back in early summer of 1960, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Things were getting ready for a new administration one way or the other. It
                    was Kennedy versus Nixon. I would think, as a political appointee, that
                    everything would be on hold.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, it wasn't because of the situation in Panama. There was a bad
                    situation in Panama. I certainly started to consider myself a cleanup man. There
                    was a horrible situation in Panama, but we'll go into that when we want to start
                    Panama.</p>
                <p>Q: Here you are, as you mentioned, a devout Christian in an amoral situation and
                    having to keep a good face on it. Just daily life there for the ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>FARLAND: For me, it was Hell really. I was running with the foxes and playing
                    with the hounds. That made it doubly hard. Life in general for the average
                    Dominican of some education, the lower-middle class, was pretty rough. There was
                    a box on the front page of the local paper which was called “El Tublico.” If the
                    headlines had said “War Is Declared. Atomic Bomb going to be dropped,” people
                    would ignore that and read that box first to make sure that their name wasn't in
                    it. It was reput that Trujillo specified that box and what was on it. “John
                    Jones is not keeping the front of his store clean” and that was enough to make a
                    man shake in his boots. We in this country can't realize what it really meant to
                    live in a dictatorship of this kind.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In normal social intercourse with the Dominicans, this
                        must havbeen very difficult. Everybody must have been watching what they
                        said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They were. There were parties and get-togethers. I remember one party
                    after someone had been murdered in town and it was pretty well known. The party
                    was like a wake. Nobody was saying anything. Even the corps was being quiet. I
                    was sitting across from the Japanese ambassador's wife. Everything was just
                    quiet. Nobody wanted to open their mouth. I said to her, “[quote in Japanese]”
                    and she laughed. I asked her if she spoke Japanese. She giggled for a while and
                    then went silent again.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll pick up Panama now. You came back from the Dominican Republic. It's
                    still the tag end of the Eisenhower administration. What was waiting for you
                    when you got back to Washington?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had definite indications that I was going to Panama. When I got back,
                    I started being briefed on Panama. We sat around and waited. There were problems
                    in Panama that I couldn't believe. I began to understand them better as I heard
                    about them. In came a telegram from Harrington, who was then ambassador in
                    Panama. It said, “Please don't ask me to leave until the head man here in the
                    Canal Zone leaves,” at which point Dulles blew up. He said, “Tell him to get out
                    of there.” So, Harrington then left. Did you know him?</p>
                <p>Q: No.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was very much a part of the State Department. He said that the
                    ambassador there in Panama was a good man, but his wife was a definite
                    detriment. But you can't put that in an efficiency report.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: They've gotten an efficiency report... At least when I left, you had to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, you were ambassador to Panama from 1960 to

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: To 1963, I think.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was told that it was a mess and to clean it up. I was told that the
                    ambassador was not speaking to the governor of the Canal Zone, the governor of
                    the Canal Zone wasn't speaking to any of them, and no one was talking to anybody
                    else. The Panamanians were playing against each other.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The governor of the Canal Zone was an American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: Three American powers there that were not talking to eacother.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Personalities. I brought this up with Eisenhower. I requested that when
                    I went out and if the governor of the Canal Z one and I could not agree on the
                    policy, then it should be referred to him for decision. He agreed to that. That
                    was in the basis of my departure.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the general in charge of Southern Command?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Generally speaking, of no particular effect on policy, although at the
                    end, proved himself to be quite a pain, if you know what I mean.</p>
                <p>Q: Usually what happens when the American military (really any military) has its
                    own zone, it tends to be rather oblivious to civilian desires, whether they're
                    American or Panamanian.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, generally speaking, we had one commander down there who was
                    oblivious to most everything because he was on the bottle all the time. But
                    while I was there, I'm glad to say that the governor of the Canal Zone and I had
                    no difference of opinion. If we had, they were minor and they were solved
                    between us. And that worked.</p>
                <p>Q: Since this is for the historical record, could you explain what the situation
                    was when you went out there, how the situation in Panama was at the time in
                    1960?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was ready to explode again.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm talking about the actual governmental situation. Could you explain a bit
                    about the role of the Republic of Panama and the role of the Zone? For the
                    reader of this, they won't be as familiar with this as you and I are.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't know how to even begin to explain that. It was a situation in
                    which there had been a hiatus between all of them and [it was possible] for the
                    locals, the Panamanians, to exploit and bid. I tried to heal that situation.</p>
                <p>Q: For somebody who is not familiar with the role of the United States at that
                    time, there was this American sovereignty right in the middle of Panama called
                    the Canal Zone.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: This is true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about somebody reading this later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They're going to have to do a lot of studying to get a fulunderstanding
                    of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your understanding of the role of the ambassador
                        and throle of the governor of the Canal Zone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>FARLAND: The governor of the Canal Zone was supposed to be the governor of the
                    Canal Zone. The ambassador of the United States was supposed to be the
                    ambassador to the Republic of Panama. The people in the Canal Zone felt that the
                    American ambassador was also their ambassador, which, in fact, he was in one
                    sense of the word, but in reality he wasn't. The governor was interposed between
                    us. It was a unique operation which no longer exists because of the change in
                    status. But it didn't have to be that way. It didn't have to be as demarked as
                    it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government of Panama like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The government of Panama was as it always was. Ernesto De La Guardia was
                    then president. He was a delightful man who I enjoyed the company of. I liked
                    him very, very much. The government was run by Anofson Blaya. It was a republic.
                    It was not bicameral. It was one in itself, sometimes less than appropriate
                    people, but mostly it was pretty well done. I don't know exactly how to get to
                    your question.</p>
                <p>Q: What I'm trying to do is to paint a picture for somebody who is going to read
                    this a century from now. We are trying to recreate what the situation was at the
                    time there.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: They had an ongoing government that was operational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we consider the government of Panama to be a
                        friendlgovernment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. I did.</p>
                <p>Q: We'll talk about the Zone a little later, but let's talk about Panama to begin
                    with. As you went there, what did you see as the major problem with our
                    relations with the government of Panama?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: The problem always was the Canal Zone. That was thproblem. We had no
                    other basic problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Canal Zone, what was seen as the clash? Was it
                        justhat it shouldn't be there, that the Panamanians should take it
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, no, no, no, no. I've said this a thousand times. I never once heard
                    one responsible Panamanian request the turnover of the Canal to Panama while I
                    was there. Never. Surprising as that may sound in view of the fact that it has
                    been turned over.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they want?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They wanted a partnership. President Shoddy, who was subsequent to the
                    president we just discussed, kept saying, “I worked on the Panama Canal” and I
                    had to go to the silver window and the Americans went to the gold window.” We
                    practiced a form of separation there-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Segregation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Precisely. That was in 1955. They attempted to get rid of it. It was not
                    gotten rid of until I got down there and Bob Fleming, who became governor of the
                    Canal Zone, and we pointed out some of the vestiges that were still hanging on
                    and we eliminated them then, and not until then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had prevented getting rid of this blatant
                        segregation?Wasn't it also a matter of toilets and drinking fountains?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was really very much a deep South mentality, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I'm a southern boy and I love the South. I love my fellow man. I love my
                    fellow man regardless of his color. I was not going to stand for any of the
                    continuation of these vestiges. I've talked to Bob about it. I said, “Look,
                    these are still existing in these forms.” He said, “We'll get rid of them
                    immediately.” He was completely cooperative. I couldn't have had a better
                    partner in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had this discrimination existed up to then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It just passed by. People were both ignoring it anpracticing it in the
                    State Department and the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been no pressure from anybody to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: There was none coming out of the embassy. I can get verhot about this.
                    This is one thing that I object to strenuously.</p>

                        1955 oin the South, but there wasn't any reflection of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was once removed and the practices were still in operation. Many of
                    them had been canceled. I don't mean to say that they weren't. In 1955, many
                    were, but there were still vestiges of it there. When I pointed this out to Bob,
                    he agreed wholeheartedly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Bob Fleming's background? Was he a Zonian

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, he was a United States engineer and a one stageneral. He was from
                    the Corps of Engineers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, the absurdity of it was a major impression upon me. I decided I
                    was going to do something about that immediately. In the first place, the three
                    principals didn't do any talking to each other and left by that time. I arrived
                    with a clean slate. We had the best possible relations. Bob Fleming, a military
                    man, a feisty little guy in many respects, couldn't have been a better companion
                    to my efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the embassy at the time, your DCM,
                        etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The DCM was an awfully nice man who wasn't the least bit happy about
                    seeing a non-career officer come in. When he left, he made a speech saying that
                    he was very much opposed to me arriving and that that attitude had completely
                    changed and he appreciated the work that I had done.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were going into a difficult

                <p>FARLAND: I didn't realize I was going into that much of a situation. I knew it
                    was going to be difficult. Carl Davis- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Carl Davis was a very close friend in the Dominican Republic. He went to Panama.
                    He was writing me, telling me what was going on in Panama.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was head of the USIS. There was much [discussion] aboua former coal

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They must have had political appointees before that.

                </p>
                <p>Q: And you were not coming straight out of East Oshkosh. You were coming from a
                    difficult embassy. You were coming with professional credentials.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: That didn't make any difference. The head of the CIA over there and the
                    ambassador spent long weekends up in Al Baliay, which was a watering spot up in
                    the mountains, playing bridge. They were exchanging information between
                    themselves and they didn't know any information. As a result, the embassy was
                    going flat and the embassy was sitting there on their cans writing reports based
                    upon the local newspapers. My first meeting... I had my spies there, let's put
                    it that way. I knew what was going on. At the first staff meeting I had, a
                    secretary came in and said, “The staff is ready.” I said, “Let them wait 10
                    minutes” and I sat there. I said, “Tell them to come in” and I sat there. I
                    didn't get up. They walked in. You've got to remember my background. I said, “My
                    name is Joseph Simpson Farland and I don't have a damn thing to prove to any of
                    you, but each one of you have a great deal to prove to me. I don't give a damn
                    if you never write another report. If you're sitting here on your pots writing
                    reports based upon what you read in the newspapers, it means nothing as far as
                    I'm concerned or the Department is concerned. I want you to get out and meet the
                    people and start showing them by the way you act and conduct yourself and the
                    way you talk what makes the United States great. We have the greatest government
                    in the world. Prove it to these people. Show them. That is what I expect. That
                    is what you will do if you're going to stay at this embassy. I have more clout
                    than you have. If there are no questions, this meeting is adjourned.” That is
                    virtually verbatim.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: There was a quiet that set over the entire embassy. One fellow I saw in
                    the hall and I said, “Do you have a car?” He said, “Yes.” I said, “I'd like to
                    go down and see Fourth of July Avenue.” He said, “Your chauffeur isn't here.” I
                    said, “You said you had a car.” He said, “I have.” I said, “Well, does it have
                    four wheels.” He said, “Yes.” I said, “Can you drive?” He said, “Yes.” I said,
                    “Could you drive me down?” He said, “In my car?” I said, “Sure, why not?” He
                    said, “Certainly.” So, we drove down to Fourth of July Avenue. They didn't
                    understand that I wasn't just striped pants out of nowhere. I meant what I said.
                    I had one officer that couldn't take it. He went by the board. The rest of them
                    came to. I had some good officers there. They just needed direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been nobody pushing them to get out and mix and
                        meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No. When the boss goes up in El Baliay for a weekend all weekend, what
                    is their point in getting out working? You've got to set an example by working
                    yourself. They didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a bit about arriving on the scene and getting
                        tknow people, getting involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The first morning I got there, I went down to the embassy and walked in
                    the front door. There was no American flag flying. That was a very important
                    point. There was no American flag flying in front of the American embassy. This
                    Marine was standing there and I said, “I have trouble finding this embassy.
                    Usually, there is an American flag flying. This is the American embassy?” He
                    said, “Yes, Sir.” I said, “Why isn't there an American flag flying?” He said,
                    “That is the ambassador's orders, Sir.” I said, “Listen, Gyrene, I've got news
                    for you. I'm the American ambassador and when I present my credentials, I want
                    that flag on that flagpole. Does that suit you?” He said, “Yes, Sir” and that is
                    the way we had one upstairs. From then on, it was all history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why hadn't the flag been flown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The ambassador was afraid they'd tear it down. When I told Eisenhower
                    that, he said, “What are you going to do about it?” I said, “I'm going to put
                    the flag up.” He said, “You'd better God damn well do that.” I said, “I intend
                    to. We've got a lot of flags to keep flying.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eisenhower had actually served in the Panama Canal
                        Zone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been there. This was a very formative period for
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that not only was undirected but
                        also wahunkered down, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It had hunkered down. We had a Foreign Service officer that was afraid,
                    afraid of his title, afraid of the future, afraid of what was going to happen to
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Fourth of July. What was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: This was sort of the dividing line between Panama City and the Canal
                    Zone. It was a business section. It's still called Avenue de July Fourth. I had
                    friends on it.</p>
                <p>While I was there, Stuart, we never had a riot. When I got there, we were faced
                    with one. I told the staff, “We have to work to prevent the riot. There is one
                    coming up. We're all dedicated to preventing that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was there going to be a riot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't remember exactly the reason, but it was very mucin vogue at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a series of riots coming up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about preventing the riot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, in the first place, I called in a group of Americans that I had
                    been told were key Americans in the community. I said, “What do we do to prevent
                    this?” They gave me their opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was basically what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Start being friendly. Start being partners. Start being neighbors. How
                    do you become friends? You become a friend by being one.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Q: How did you find the Panamanians? Had they been sort of ignored? I'm talking
                    about both in the government and the people, opinion makers and all that?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: They felt like they were left out of it. Panamanians basically wanted to
                    be considered part of the partnership. President Shoddy told me this one time.
                    They wanted to feel like they contributed something to this. They didn't want to
                    feel like the cousin that had an abortion or something. There was plenty of good
                    feeling among the Panamanians. It was there, but it had to be corralled and it
                    had to be supported.</p>
                <p>Then I brought in all the Panamanians I could think of and we had a session. Then
                    I got Americans and Panamanians together and we had a session. We talked. How
                    else do you get to know people? You talk.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at the other side, what was your impression of your initial meetings
                    with the people from the Panama Canal Zone, the Americans? These have all been
                    portrayed as being very insular.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: There was a small group in the Zone who were insular. It was headed up
                    by none other than Judge Crowell. I use his name very carefully. The judge was a
                    very important man in the Canal Zone. He had a judgeship and he ran it over the
                    smallest territory. He did quite a job. He didn't like me and I didn't like
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the American Canal Zonians as one of the
                        groups yohad to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: A small group, yes. The basic Zonian, no. Some of my best friends were
                    Zonians who had been there for a couple of generations. They didn't have that
                    feeling. They felt they were part of Panama. They did not. I can't stress that
                    point too strongly. There were a few (and they had a constituency in the United
                    States government in the Congress) and they were loud and made all kinds of
                    noises, but it was a small group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this affect you all and what you were trying to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It didn't help in the least. He represented most of [what]was accredited
                    to the Zonians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that he was prejudiced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes, he was highly prejudiced.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background? FARLAND: I don't know his
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived, were there ongoing problems of
                        jurisdictionacomplaints between Panamanians and Zonians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Those were problems which could have been solved easily, but they
                    weren't. But they weren't ongoing. This didn't represent a major problem.
                    Looking at it from a Panamanian standpoint to be judged in an American court
                    because you're on that territory particularly was aggravating, but that was not
                    a fundamental problem. It became a problem. Now that's all passed. You're
                    talking about “has been.” But no, that was not something that raised any
                    havoc.</p>
                <p>Q: I am told that one of the great irritants was the fact that a Panamanian, in
                    order to go from the north to the south of his own country had to be stopped by
                    military police and all that going through the Zone.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: They wanted a right of passage, which would have been a simple thing to
                    do. We had some stubborn people in the United States that couldn't see the
                    obvious. We agreed to build a bridge. That is a long, sad story. We didn't build
                    it. We didn't build it. We didn't build it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the bridge designed to sort of go over-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes, it went over the Canal. There was a nice, wonderful old gentleman
                    by the name of Thatcher. They named the ferry that ran across there “Thatcher
                    Ferry” and then they wanted to name the bridge “Thatcher Ferry Bridge.” The
                    President of the United States, one of the speechwriters, and I were in
                    conference. The President said, “Go see Mr. Thatcher and see if he will agree to
                    taking his name off that bridge.” Well, we went. I felt sorry for the old man,
                    honestly. He was sitting there in an old office that had the dust of centuries
                    in it. His breakfast for several years had been on it. He said, “I would like to
                    acquiesce to the President's suggestion, but I have friends that won't
                    understand. I will be letting them down if I take my name away from that.” I
                    felt sorry for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they want to take the name away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: So it could be named “The Bridge of the Americas” and have no connection
                    with the Panama Canal. But Thatcher's Ferry was a name that was synonymous with
                    the Canal. And there was almost a riot the day the bridge was [transferred].
                    They, the Panamanians, changed the name of it that day.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it built during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It did get built, but did that mean that the

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Not during the time I was there, but it was promised i1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could a Panamanian then go across that bridge without
                        touching-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No problem. All you had to do was drive across it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It later became a big problem. Were you concerned about
                        thyounger generation, particularly high school kids, in the Zone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Those younger kids were egged on by their parents. They wouldn't do that
                    by themselves. Before that happened, Shoddy went to Washington to see the
                    conference with Kennedy, a Washington trip. Kennedy (and I was in the meeting
                    and heard it precisely) told him that he understood it was a marriage
                    consummated with a shotgun, but be that as it may, we were considering the
                    possibility of... He said, “First, right now, with politics being what it is, we
                    can't very well do too much to change things. Secondly, we're considering the
                    possibility of a sea level canal to be dug by nuclear energy. That would take
                    about seven years to ascertain the “yays” and “nays” of that situation. So, we
                    don't want to do anything during that period.” Shoddy bought it.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Then we start home and Shoddy had only asked for so many hours to be away. We
                    were flying back in a Panamanian plane from Miami. We got over Cuba and we lost
                    an engine. Dickie Audies, a former president, came back to me and said, “Joe,
                    we've lost an engine.” I said, “Don't give me that stuff, Dickie! I'm tired. I'm
                    worn out. I want to sleep a bit.” He said, “No, I mean it. We're going back to
                    Miami.” I said, “Are we?” “Yes, we are.” And back to Miami we came. Well, Shoddy
                    came to me and said, “Look, if I don't get back to Panama, I will no longer be
                    president. If I am not there by midnight, I am not going to be president of
                    Panama. I know what those politicians are doing. They are down there figuring
                    out who is going to be president. You've got to get a supersonic jet.” I arrived
                    back in Miami and got a hold of a phone. I think it was PanAm. I don't know who
                    paid for it. But I called the White House, SAC, everyone. They wondered who the
                    crazy guy was yelling about saving the president of Panama. And I'm yelling for
                    a supersonic plane. Finally, somebody said, “Well, the plane will be at Helmeted
                    Air Base.” I said, “How in the hell do I get there?” He said, “We'll have a
                    helicopter come and pick you up.” I said to Nino (Charlie's nickname), “Nino,
                    who do you want to go with us?” He said, “Well, I guess my foreign minister.”
                    “You mean Nyato Galileo Solis?” “Yes.” So, the three of us get in this
                    helicopter and go through all that traffic and out to Helmeted. We get off the
                    plane and there are a couple of pilots in work clothes that had just been torn
                    out of a cocktail party with a 707. Nino Shoddy said, “That's not a supersonic
                    plane.” I said, “No, that's not a supersonic plane.” He said, “Take me back to
                    Miami.” I said, “Okay. Call that chopper back.” It came back in. We got in and
                    flew back over to the airport in Miami and dropped down into the traffic circle.
                    At that point, Charlie is going literally out of his mind. He is no longer going
                    to be president. I saw purely as a coincidence, one of these things that happen,
                    a Panamanian flag on the tail of an airplane with the motors running. I said,
                    “Nino, get your butt up on that plane. That is a Panamanian plane. As soon as
                    it's three miles out, you're in Panamanian territory.” He ran up to the plane,
                    up the steps, and Galileo followed him. I went to bed. That actually happened!
                    Nino Shoddy knows that I saved his presidency that night. That plane took off.
                    I'm not sure it took off by twelve o'clock, but that's when it was recorded
                    at.</p>
                <p>Q: You went out there in the summer of 1960 under the presidency of Dwight
                    Eisenhower. By January 20, 1961, John F. Kennedy was president and here you were
                    appointed by one president. Did you feel your position was precarious?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was probably ready to go home, if that's what you mean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally, when a new president-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They ask for your resignation. I was perfectly willing to resign... For
                    reasons that I have been told, that a petition that was signed, the first name
                    on it was Nino Shoddy was sent to the presidency asking that I be kept. I don't
                    know. I don't think anybody did me a great favor by keeping me there. I got into
                    nothing but trouble from there on.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about the trouble. First, what sort of support were you getting
                    when the Kennedy administration came in? Each time a new administration comes
                    in, there is always a learning curve. The Kennedy one, as I recall, particularly
                    in Latin American Affairs, was sort of an amateur takeover at the beginning.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was amateur. I sat back and enjoyed it. There was not anything I
                    could do about it. I was there. Dean Rusk comes down and I take him to meet the
                    President. On the way down, he told me in no uncertain terms that I was not his
                    choice as ambassador and I'd better mind my Ps and Qs. I didn't appreciate those
                    comments a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems sort of grumpy on his part.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It seemed grossly inappropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any reason why he felt that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I have no idea why he felt that way. I was a Republican, of which they
                    were well aware. I was the only Republican they kept. I got along fine with
                    Kennedy as far as person to person was concerned. I'm not quite sure at the end
                    of it, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was originally the head of ARA at that time, the
                        deputsecretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Ed Martin was appointed by Kennedy. Ed Martin did not like me. He and
                    Rusk must have had conversations about it before because he didn't like me a
                    bit. It became mutual after a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have words with Martin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was told by Martin one day, “You will not go up on the Hill and talk
                    to congressmen. You will not do that and I'm telling you right now.” I said,
                    “You're telling me that I cannot exercise freedom of speech? I intend to go up
                    to the Congress and talk to congressmen. What do you intend to do about it?” He
                    said, “I'm telling you not to?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would you be going up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>FARLAND: I wanted to tell them what was going on. I wanted support for some
                    projects that I had. Naturally, I wanted support. With AID, I was having all
                    kinds of problems. AID had wanted to build superhighways from here to there with
                    no traffic on them. I wanted to build little roads. I wanted to build little
                    schoolhouses with people using a machine to make bricks, which could be built
                    for about $5.00. I came from West Virginia. I saw this done. In West Virginia,
                    we had dirt roads. You don't have to have superhighways to open up commerce. I
                    opened up Tro Bray, which opened up a whole new area of Panama. I don't know how
                    many people came down to tell me I couldn't do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the impetus coming from for the
                        superhighways?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Out of AID/Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that they were enamored with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's the way it should be, government to government on big scale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your AID director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was a nice man. He had bulldozers, shovels, scrapers, jackhammers,
                    and Ingersoll compressors all over the field. The were digging holes and filling
                    them up. I said, “The hell with these apples. Let's get them in the line and
                    build a road.” That's what we did at between four and five thousand dollars a
                    mile. We opened up a whole new section of country. We were told we couldn't do
                    it and we did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine that the AID director would begin to
                        feeconflicted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was going back and forth to Washington. I don't know how much it cost
                    every trip he made, but he told them that I was going ahead and doing this,
                    that, and the other. They told me that we couldn't build houses because the
                    people wouldn't work. Once they got their house built, they would... I said,
                    “You don't understand how it's done. We will build five houses with these men
                    working on them. We will supply the equipment. At the end of that time, we will
                    have a drawing for who gets the house. All the houses are going to be built the
                    same.” It's simple. It was done by the pilgrims when they first came over here
                    the same way. We were in virgin territory. There was no reason why we had to
                    start big. We opened up a whole area which was a hotbed of communism down at
                    Sonawa. I think it was about four or five thousand dollars a mile. They're now
                    exporting rice from that area. Before, Panama was importing rice. This to me was
                    so self-evident that I was willing to fight for it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the administration was set to only do
                        largprojects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: This was their policy. It was government to government.They didn't
                    believe in government to people. And I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under the Kennedy administration, there was the Alliance

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Alianza Para El Progreso. It was a good thing, but there wasn't enough
                    money in that to do what they were planning to do. There wasn't enough money.
                    There wasn't enough money in the United States to rebuild Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it have any impact on Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Oh, I made some speeches to that effect and when I did, I said, “I'm
                    going to put up some signs indicating what we're doing here.” “You can't do
                    that. They'll tear them down.” I said, “You're nuts. They won't tear these signs
                    down.” As far as I know, they're still there. They weren't torn down while I was
                    doing it. I had Alianza Para El Progreso, Panama and the United States joined in
                    partnership shaking hands, building a road together. They're going to tear that
                    sign down? No way. They didn't.</p>
                <p>Q: All during this time, particularly the Kennedy administration, you had almost
                    a habitual Cuban crisis. What about the Bay of Pigs? Did that Cuba have any
                    effect on Panama?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I got rid of it early on. I got the Cuban ambassador kicked out of
                    Panama by the government. Panama was a route that the communists were coming up
                    into Latin America, especially into Mexico and across Cuba. Did that have an
                    effect on Panama? Not particularly at that point. Things were pretty well under
                    control by that time. I was settled in.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>I want to tell you about the flag. President Eisenhower said, “What about the
                    flag issue?” That is when I said there were two issues. He was talking about a
                    flag in front of the embassy. He said, “I want you to go down there and give me
                    your best opinion on whether or not we should raise the flag in the Canal Zone.”
                    I did and I talked to Panamanians, Americans, and those who the locals knew.
                    Finally, I decided to raise a flag. I so indicated to the President. He decided
                    that he would raise a flag to indicate “titular recognition of titular
                    sovereignty in Shaylor's triangle.” The Panamanians thought Shaylor's triangle
                    was part of Panama anyway, so the impact was a little less than had been
                    planned. I got a telegram to that effect. Either in that telegram or one that
                    came immediately thereafter, I was informed that the president of Panama cannot
                    touch the halyard when that flag of Panama is being raised. I couldn't believe
                    it! We're doing a magnanimous act. We raise their flag. We're meeting their
                    expectations. He can't touch the halyard? This didn't make any sense! I sent a
                    telegram back to the Department saying, “I've been informed that there is going
                    to be a riot if the President does touch that halyard.” I got a telegram back
                    saying, “He cannot touch the halyard because 'this might establish a
                    precedent.'” I'll be damned if I understand where in the hell the precedent
                    would be in such an event. But that is what I got from the State Department. I
                    would like to know who formulated that telegram.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, the president of the Republic of Panama
                        was noallowed to touch it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was not allowed to touch it. This was Ernesto De La Guardia. I had to
                    go tell him that he couldn't touch the halyard. I'll tell you what I did. I had
                    a copy of the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi. I read it. I reread it and
                    reread it. I carried it with me out to where his home was. The first line of
                    that is, “Oh, Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.” I sat down with Ernesto
                    De La Guardia and said, “This is the situation” and he cried. He said, “Not you,
                    Joe, but those people in the State Department don't understand that we
                    Panamanians think with our hearts and not with our heads. Foreigners mean so
                    much to us. I'm crushed. I graduated from Dartmouth. I've lived in the United
                    States more years than I've lived in Panama. I don't understand. I don't
                    understand.” I cried with him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feedback from the Department about why all

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>FARLAND: He wasn't there. He didn't come to the flag raising. I had to do
                    something. The only thing I could to do to save the situation, which I knew was
                    going to be a disaster, was say, “Ernesto, I know you won't come. I know you
                    can't come under the circumstances. Will you invite me down to the presidencia
                    for a drink after this is over?” He said, “Of course, Joe. Heavens, mi casa es
                    su casa (my home is your home). Of course you can come down and have a drink.”
                    When the flag went up, I got in my car immediately and drove down to the
                    presidencia and had a drink with him. I'm not only proud of that, but that is
                    what I did. It saved a riot and it also buzzed up a situation to which-</p>

                <p>FARLAND: The question was raised “Why did the President invite hidown?” So, there
                    was enough buzz to give rise to a question.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: They were shipping books into the campesinos, into their schools. Yes,
                    they were definitely trying. There were some Panamanians, Margot Fonteyn being
                    one, who tried to start a little revolution.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: They thought they would have themselves a little revolution. It didn't

                <p>FARLAND: I saw quite a number of them that did. It was a nice place to come to
                    when the snow was flying in Washington. I gave good cocktail parties for them. I
                    would get these telegrams saying, “Senator So and So is arriving with two AAs
                    (administrative assistants) or three AAs and would like to meet 100

                    wife had a wonderful idea. Because people in Panama City stayed right there or
                    went up to El Baliay or went to Colon (That was the only route across the
                    Isthmus.), the people in the interior never got to see the embassy. So, she

                <p>We went to Santiago and we went to other major capitals. We had an embassy party.
                    People were delighted. I got to meet an awful lot of people and they got to meet
                    me. That was part of it.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the political situation in Panama working? Was it a matter of
                    some political leaders who would have cohorts following them around or was it
                    corruption? What was the situation as you found it?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Corruption isn't only limited to Panama. There was plenty of corruption
                    in Panama. Candelio was still a part of Latin American heritage. It's one reason
                    why Moralias was elected president three times and kicked out three times. No,
                    they followed the leader and did the same things we do in the States. They had
                    more of an English system. They would go to an area and say you wanted to
                    represent that area and not live there. We require residency. They didn't in
                    Panama.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Panamanian national guard at that time? What

                <p>FARLAND: It was the national guard. They had no army. We took over the... Here is
                    where the cheese is going to become binding today. I was at a cocktail party one
                    time up in Colombia. A very intelligent, erudite woman said to me, “You give the
                    Canal to the Panamanians and we'll come and get it because it is ours. That
                    country belongs to Colombia. You helped take it away at one time. Now we'll take
                    it back.” Incidentally, as of today, the year 2000, Panamanians are having
                    trouble in the Daliene because of the influx of Colombians into the Daliene
                    area. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if someday they'll be screaming for the
                    United States government to send troops in to save the Canal from the
                    Colombians.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: I kicked the head of the CIA out. Q: Why?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Because he was spending too much time in El Baliay playing bridge. He
                    was spending the rest of his time in the Canal Zone where he had his offices.
                    Seldomly did he attend even staff meetings. I thought “This is no good. This is
                    not going to work” and I suggested his removal and [it he was removed].</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, they used the commissary, but... The line of demarcation there
                    didn't exist really except in the way that one was cleaner than the other, the
                    grass was greener than the other. They had the right to use it.</p>
                <p>Q: Who were the Panamanian leaders? Was it a small group of people located that
                    divided up jobs among themselves?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: In any country, as you well know, you can go in and in a week you know
                    who is running what and whose voice you're going to hear. Panama is a small
                    country. There were some fine, educated, knowledgeable people there. Some of
                    them were then... The Moda family was very influential. These were wonderful
                    men. There were five of them. They were outstanding. There were two families
                    Odias. I shant make the differentiation between them. There were two sisters.
                    One of them was an Odias and one of them was a Herbomat. They were the social
                    lions of this town. But it didn't take long to know with whom you were dealing.
                    One night at a cocktail party, you could meet almost everybody.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The currency was the American dollar. They called it th“balboa” for
                    their edification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, was it a case of the Panamanians trying

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>FARLAND: They thought they should have a national currency, but they wanted to
                    use the American dollar. They certainly profited by the fact that they used the
                    American dollar.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you keeping an eye on how the Canal was going or was it going so well

                <p>FARLAND: It was running along smoothly. I've gone through the locks. I've been
                    down in the locks. I've always been interested in mechanics. I wanted to see how
                    it worked. I wanted to see how everything came together. I was down in there, up
                    in the towers, and so forth. I saw the whole works. It was an unbelievable
                    construction job. It was the greatest undertaking at the time. We spent more
                    money, according to one history book I read, in buying that area which is about
                    1/4 or � of the size of Long Island than we did for the Louisiana Purchase,
                    Alaska, and the Gadsden Purchase.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's like Teddy Roosevelt. He was always making commentjust to make

                <p>Q: At the time, it's sort of appalling to think that we were considering putting

                <p>FARLAND: This is still under consideration.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: It still is. It was in the agreements that they've signed here recently.
                    There were three parts to that treaty. That was one of them. However, let me
                    tell you a little story about this. While Shoddy was sitting there waiting to
                    hear from Kennedy and while we Fleming and I were appointed ambassador and
                    consultant to deal with Galileo Solis and another man whose name I don't
                    remember, I go to a ball game one night with President Shoddy. I had heard that
                    day over our wire that we had signed a non-nuclear defense agreement. That meant
                    no Panama Canal by nuclear means. The fallout would be 50 miles or something. I
                    don't know the exact wording anymore. I said to Nino that night, “You know, I
                    had word today that you signed a nuclear agreement.” He said, “I heard it on the
                    radio.” This didn't help our cause any at all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: There were virtually no people. There were some Indians down there, some
                    people, yes, but they can be moved out. They could do a 50 mile stretch. A
                    controlled blast could be done underground, no overeffect. But still, there is
                    going to be something. It was a big deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the talk that had gone on prior to that? We're
                        talkinabout the turn of the century. That is a Nicaraguan canal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: There were those in Congress who were still fighting for the Nicaragua
                    canal when Teddy Roosevelt took possession of Panama. They still believe it. As
                    far as I know, they still think Nicaragua is it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That wasn't a problem. There was a great deal of association between
                    them. There was a small group that were perfectly content to be totally
                    separate, be antagonistic to Panamanians totally. There was a small group of
                    Panamanians who were perfectly content to be antagonistic toward the Canal and
                    were. This we had to deal with. We had some wonderful people in Panama who were
                    understanding and were voices of moderation. We didn't have that many in the
                    States at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It didn't impact it. The warships came through there. Hubert Humphrey
                    happened to be a guest at that time of the embassy. I took him over to the Canal
                    and he wanted to know, “Is anybody there from Minnesota?” Nobody seemed to be. I
                    said to my wife after dinner when we were up in the bedroom, “How did you get
                    along?” She said, “I got along fine. Hubert said I was the best
                    conversationalist he had talked to in a long, long time.” I said, “What did you
                    say?” She said, “I didn't say anything.”</p>

                    the jungle training area on the east coast. He wanted a twin engine plane. Well,
                    I had no planes. I didn't even have a boat. I finally got a single engine plane.
                    He didn't like that. But we started to land over there and hit a crosswind and
                    it turned up on the side. The pilot gave it the gun and we hung on the prop. I
                    think Hubert thought we were going to crash. I wasn't too damn sure we weren't
                    going to crash. We just hung there for a while and finally... He wanted to go
                    home right then and there. He didn't want to see anything else. So, he went back
                    to Panama.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I'm the guy that started the School of the Americas, but I had started
                    it on a different basis than it ended up. Having been in the FBI and knowing
                    that there was animosity between the police forces of each country, I wanted
                    some place where you could get groups of these forces together and let them get
                    drunk together, have a big time together, get into a canteen, and get to know
                    each other. There would be unity and there would be the transfer of information
                    between countries, which at that time there was not. So that was the basis for
                    the organization of that. I went to J. Edgar Hoover and told him what I had in
                    mind. He thought it was a good idea. He thought it was an excellent idea. He
                    said, “But don't let the army get involved.” Well, once I suggested it and
                    started it, I had no control over it.</p>

                    end is up against Costa Rica. There was David, which was a very energetic town.
                    The Chiticanos up there wanted to separate themselves from Panama because they
                    weren't getting proper treatment from Panama. But the Inter-American Highway,
                    which I finally drove over all the way to Costa Rica, made it more united. David
                    was a delightful little town with very prosperous, hardworking, and energetic
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see Panama as being a meeting place between North

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was, but I didn't visualize that. I was too busy trying to make sure
                    that we didn't have a riot. It obviously is. I'm going to get this little remark
                    into the conversation. Through the help of the government, I kicked the Cuban
                    embassy out of Panama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>FARLAND: By suggesting to the president that their presence was not conducive to
                    the best relations and he agreed and out they went. The day I was leaving, I had
                    about 50-60 people up in the embassy, dignitaries and government. A lady whose
                    presence was not exactly [appreciated] in the embassy before I got there, but I
                    saw no reason why she shouldn't be made a part in being invited was Thelma King,
                    who was head of the Communist Party. She walks in. Well, I can't very well take
                    her in to where the foreign minister is, so I take her into the library. Thelma
                    says, “I just came back from Cuba.” I said, “Really? Did you see Fidel?” She
                    said, “Yes.” I said, “How is he?” “Oh, he's fine.” I said, “Did you tell him I
                    was leaving?” She said, “Yes, I did.” “What did he say?” He said, “It's a great,
                    great, great day for Latin America.” At one point, I got her to stop a riot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep talking about riots and stopping riots. Was this
                        continuing problem of keeping order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Anytime there was a flashpoint which could suddenly arise, it would give
                    rise to the possibility of a riot. The communists were pretty well organized
                    there in Panama. They didn't like me a bit because I had taken away their voice,
                    their publication, and gotten rid of their embassy. I was persona non grata as
                    far as they were concerned. But they were still there. They were there at the
                    time of the riots in 1964.</p>
                <p>Q: I can see riots taking place when an American military person or a Zonian has
                    an automobile accident, particularly if they seriously injure a Panamanian. I
                    would think that would be one of the standard things.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a task force between you and the Panamanian

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. There was no formal setup, but we understood each other. It was in
                    the best interests of both of us not to have a riot and to do everything we
                    could to prevent it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could you do yourself? Most of these riots would

                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>FARLAND: Thelma came in one day. As she was getting up, she said, “There is going
                    to be a riot starting at the university.” I said, “Thelma, come on back and sit
                    down. I want to talk to you. You're a Panamanian. I most certainly am an
                    American. We both have the interests of this country at heart. I'm here to help
                    Panama. I'm not here to hinder it in any way. I want to help my country, but I'm
                    certainly here to be of assistance to do what I can to bolster your country. A
                    riot is not going to help the Panamanians. It's not going to help the United
                    States. It's going to be a further detriment. It's going to injure a lot of
                    people. It's going to hurt a lot of people. What is gained by it except
                    publicity, tear gas, and problems? Why don't you join me in this and go back and
                    talk to those students there at the university and tell them to call this one
                    off for a change just to see how that would work?” She said, “I'll see what I
                    can do?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Thelma King?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: She was a member of parliament, of the Alsamblaya. She waa very
                    influential woman. She was quite a speaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she an American by origin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, she was Panamanian. She was a woman that needed somebody to at least
                    talk to her frankly and with some degree of understanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she able to talk them out of the riot? FARLAND: No

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I almost had a fight over one of the Marines chasing a little girl. The
                    father came to me. I was able to put quietude to it. Otherwise, there would have
                    been a riot over there, for sure.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: It was a rough situation.</p>

                    elsewhere even to this day. Was our military working to keep this sort of thing

                <p>FARLAND: I hope so. I don't know why they wouldn't be.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, they ship them out, but that isn't a complete cover. It requires
                    goodwill on the part of both sides to soften this thing down. It worked. That's
                    all I can tell you. I know the way I played it worked.</p>
                <p>Q: Particularly in the Latin American context, but other places, too, any
                    university is often a source of agitation. These are young men and some young
                    women who want to sew their oats and they're almost supposed to do this. How did
                    you deal with the university?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, I knew a couple of the professors who were very instrumental in
                    carrying the word from me to the students. I didn't make any appearances over at
                    the university, although I lived close to it. I wasn't going to volunteer to go
                    in. If I had been invited, I would have. I had enough other people to carry the
                    torch.</p>
                <p>Q: During the Kennedy administration, both John Kennedy and his brother, Bobby
                    Kennedy, there was tremendous emphasis on getting to youth, particularly picking
                    out leaders and reaching out to young people. Every embassy had to have a youth
                    officer. How did you deal with that?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I tried to keep them away for a long time. I finally had a group come
                    in. I was talking to one young lady in the group one night. I said, “Who do you
                    consider to be one of the most important men in Latin America?” She said, “Fidel
                    Castro?” I said, “Why do you say that?” She said, “Because he is a leader and I
                    respect him.” I said, “Where did you learn all this about Fidel?” She said,
                    “That is what we were taught in our class before I came down here.” I said,
                    “Well, that's very interesting. I appreciate your position, but I don't agree
                    with it. I think there are others that represent a better point of view, but I'm
                    sure that your point of view has some merit, whatever it is.” That was one
                    indication that I had. Another indication was, I had one young man up at Tillo
                    Bray, where I got a school started, built. It must have been a 12-14 room
                    school, all handmade. He had sexual relations with every teacher in the place. I
                    don't know how many children he squired. On the other hand, there was one girl
                    in a village who was such a great asset to the other village that when her tour
                    of duty was up, she went home and came back to that village of her own accord.
                    She was a shining light in that area. So, there were some that did and some that
                    weren't.</p>
                <p>Q: It simply came out at the time of Kennedy's assassination... You had left by
                    that time.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was on an airplane when I heard it. I was coming down from New
                    York.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: I think they respected him and felt kindly of him. didn't see too
                    much...</p>
                <p>Q: Was there at all the problem that we certainly suffer in places like Greece,
                    even in Canada, where it was “Oh, your country is so big and we're so small. You
                    really have to understand us?”</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I didn't hear that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This wasn't a Panamanian attitude.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No. I didn't have any sense of that at all.</p>
                <p>Q: I don't know whether you can give an explicated version of your dealings with
                    the brother of President Kennedy, Teddy Kennedy. It was not a happy
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: It wasn't a happy occasion for me and he had no official position
                    whatsoever, but I was told to roll out the red rug. He came to Panama and did
                    not make much of an impression. The headlines of one paper said, “He came, he
                    saw, and he left.” The embassy did everything we could to make his stay
                    worthwhile.</p>
                <p>Q: But this was a trip Teddy Kennedy made throughout Latin America. He was quite
                    a young man, had not been elected to the Senate. So, he was obviously under 30
                    at the time, I think. From the descriptions, it was more a playboy's romp than a
                    fact finding trip.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, he paid no attention to the briefing which we gave to the group.
                    They were more attentive. He was reading something in his briefcase most of the
                    time. Then he finally just said, “Enough of that” and suggested everybody leave,
                    so they left after being fed sufficiently.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: She was a known communist agitator. She agitated. I was surprised that
                    Trujillo allowed her in the Dominican Republic, but he did. She tried at one
                    time along with her husband to bring about a small revolution there, which
                    failed utterly. They were chastised. But no one really gets hurt when everybody

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They were very active. At one point, the British ambassador when I was
                    complaining about... I can't recall enough to tell the story, but he stuck it
                    into me about “Well, why didn't you mention that when you started making callous
                    remarks about England when we were trying to take over the Suez?” They were
                    active. We were in best relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there in 1963, you kept riots out of the

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. But we're leading up to when I left. It was a verunfortunate
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk about that now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. This is a very important aspect of it. There were two concerns.
                    Kiel Kilbane Housing Project, which was very much on my mind. It was about a $10
                    million project. According to the best Panamanian accountants, there looked like
                    there was going to be about $3 million left going to a senator here in the
                    United States and to a Dominican who was part English. His father was American.
                    That was of considerable concern to me. I was told to sign off on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who told you to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: A little man comes down. He said, “I'm here from the Secretary of State.
                    The Secretary of State wants you to sign off.” I said, “If you want to go back
                    and have the Secretary of State put that in writing... Here I am in Washington.
                    I don't have my staff with me. Therefore, I'm breaking a classic rule. But if
                    the Secretary of State orders me to sign off on it, I will.” He never showed up
                    again. That housing project never came to fruition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the feeling that this was a graft
                        project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>FARLAND: First, the two individuals who were sponsoring it. The senator, I knew,
                    was involved in all kinds of activities. Second, the fact that, according to one
                    individual who joined my embassy down there, who got very drunk one night and
                    didn't know who he was talking to, he started telling me about how he happened
                    to be sent to Panama and who was his mark. He was talking about the ambassador.
                    Well, I was sitting there listening to all his comments with great enjoyment. It
                    was pretty evident, the number of units and so forth that it couldn't be done
                    and have a halfway kind of a house. You had tarpaper houses and with the first
                    rain the thing would be gone. I don't have the figures. I can't go back on it.
                    But I had them at the time and so did the Panamanians. They were opposed to it.
                    I was opposed to it. I thought that $3 million was too much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was supposedly part of an AID project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, it came through the AID program, yes. I presume it did. If I had
                    to resign on that basis, I was going to resign. I was not going to let that go
                    on. I got a call from President Shoddy. He said, “Go up to your residence and
                    put on a sport shirt and I'll be up to pick you up.” He drove up to see me. He
                    was doing the driving. The two of us drove around for about four hours. He said,
                    “Joe, I've got to have some more money.” I said, “Nino, it isn't the $1,930,000
                    that the United States pays in so-called 'rent,' but it's all this other money
                    that- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>We drove around. I kept talking about the millions of dollars that the army was
                    bringing into this country, the payment to laborers, etc. He said, “I'm taking
                    all that into consideration. You're paying $25 million for this island down here
                    over which you're flying on your flights out of Kennedy. I'm telling you a fact
                    of life. I have to have at least $2 million more. If you can see your way clear
                    as a country to provide Panama with $2 million more, I will personally guarantee
                    with all my honor and family honor that there will be no other request, there
                    will be no agitation for anything further for at least seven years. I am using
                    that seven year period because of what President Kennedy said, that it would
                    take seven years to decide whether or not you're going to do a sea level
                    canal.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he want the money for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>FARLAND: To run his government. The more I thought about it, the more I thought
                    that that wasn't too exorbitant a request since here we had paid $250,000 for a
                    long time and then we raised that to a total of $1,930,000 a year and in light
                    of the environment and the economy of today. It was within reason assuming that
                    he would carry out his statement that there be no further agitation. I think he
                    was a man of honor. I could trust him. Believing that, I asked for a
                    consultation in Washington. I finally got it. I went up to Washington and had a
                    meeting arranged in one of the Under Secretary's meeting rooms. I don't know
                    whether there were 16 or 18 people there. I don't know how many. But there was a
                    sizable number. I am sitting with my back to the entrance door. I had my papers
                    there. I said, “I guess Ed Martin has been held up for some reason. It's almost
                    10 minutes past our time. Let me just give you a little background.” I started
                    casually to talk about a little background. The door opened with a swish and
                    Martin walked in. He in a loud, raucous voice said, “I'm only going to say this
                    once because I don't like to say it. We're not going to give those God damned
                    Panamanians a God damned cent.” So, I closed up my books and I went over to see
                    Ed Dungan at the White House and told him that my activity in Panama was
                    finished, what would be my next post. He said, “Oh, go and see head of Personnel
                    in State.” I went over to see the head of Personnel in State. He was about the
                    color of your piece of paper there, bright red. I said, “Where is my next post?”
                    He said, “I've been told (which meant that he had had a telephone call before I
                    got there) to offer you lateral entry into the Foreign Service.” I looked at him
                    for a minute. I sort of smiled and said, “And what would I get out of that?” He
                    said, “For Heaven sakes, don't ever say I said it, but maybe you would get a
                    desk in the hallway on the first floor.” I said, “That is what I thought. Thank
                    you very much. You've done what you were supposed to do. Now I have to do what I
                    am supposed to do.” I went back to Panama and started to say goodbye. It took me
                    three weeks to make my rounds and say goodbye. I don't know how many people in
                    those various towns I talked to. There must have been 35,000 at the dock to say
                    goodbye to me when I left. I am proud of the fact that I made some impression on
                    Panama while I was there. We never had a riot. President Shoddy a couple of days
                    before I left said, “You know, Joe, I'm glad you're leaving.” I said, “I don't
                    understand that. You were the one who not two days ago said how sorry you were
                    that I'm leaving.” He said, “You stayed two more weeks and you would have had my
                    job.” So, that is when I left Panama. I left with regret.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>FARLAND: I have no idea. He had a deep abiding antipathy for the Panamanians. As
                    a matter of fact, he came down and stayed at the embassy for a couple of days
                    and I took him up to Rio Alto, where we had started with the financial help also
                    of the Panamanians who had driven up there to be there when he arrived, to help
                    the fishermen a Rio Alto preserve their catch. As it was, fish don'keep well in
                    the tropics. If they didn't sell them that day, they're gone. They're not
                    edible. What we did was a refrigerator plant, a small one. I think it cost maybe
                    a little more than $5,000. Part of this money was put up by the Panamanian
                    people. These businessmen were there. I couldn't get a conversation in the car
                    with Ed. I tried to talk to him. We drove silent. We got there. He got out of
                    the car. I introduced him to these Panamanian businessmen who were there. He
                    looked at this building, which was about 20 feet by 11 feet, with a compressing
                    unit that had a refrigerating unit in it. The first thing he said to a good
                    friend of mine, a Panamanian, he looked around and said, “How is this going to
                    be advertised?” He didn't say, “I think this is a nice idea. I think it's nice
                    of you businessmen to come out here. I'm glad you're all taking an interest. I
                    know you had to get up early to drive out.” No, no. “How is this going to be
                    advertised?” He was an economist. I think he was a good economist from all I
                    could hear. But where was the feeling of empathy towards these people. They were
                    interested in a project to help Panamanians. This is what I cannot understand
                    and don't understand. I find it unfortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To finish up this Panama period, would you tell what
                        happened noon your watch but afterwards in 1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: In 1964, I am taking my younger son to try to get him enrolled in
                    Lawrenceville and on the radio I hear about these riots. I said, “This is going
                    to blow.” It did. That night, my mother called me and was worried to death for
                    fear that he son was going to be blamed for it. I had a hard time explaining to
                    my mother that, no, I would have no part of it, that I had been long gone. As I
                    told you, she died that night, too, so all this burns on me pretty badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the cause of the riot and what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The high school students, the Zonians, tore down the Panamanian flag.
                    They had been egged on by, presumably, certain parents who didn't like to see
                    the Panamanian flag flying. The riots were carefully orchestrated by the
                    Communist Party. There is no question in my mind about that, but “The New York
                    Times” had an article... To me, it was sickening. It didn't have to happen. That
                    riot should never have happened. I still say if Washington had listened a little
                    bit longer with a little bit more care to some of the things I was telling them,
                    there would have been a better understanding. I felt terribly sorry about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the aftermath of the riots?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>FARLAND: Several people were killed. Several Americans and a number of
                    Panamanians were killed. They had a large number, but they weren't all killed in
                    the riots. Some of them fell down from someplace. They have a Day of the Martyrs
                    now. It's now a cause celebre. This hurt. I spent almost three years working
                    like the devil down there to bring about better relations. “We're not going to
                    give the Panamanians a cent.” Well, now we're given them billions and the canal
                    to go with it.</p>
                <p>Q: So we're really talking about the middle of 1963 when you left. I think we
                    should pick this up the next time with what you did between posts before you
                    went off to Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I didn't have much to do with the American government owant any part of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: My wife and I decided we would like an apartment in New York and finally
                    decided against that and finally bought a place on Massachusetts Avenue in
                    Washington. Like all ladies, she wanted to remodel it, so we remodeled it and
                    moved in. Then came the riots in Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I decided to sell it. By that time, there was a possibility of Nixon
                    coming in and possibly another post. We took two apartments over at the
                    Watergate, two penthouses. We used one of them for storage and for servants to
                    live in and one for us and were there when I was appointed ambassador to
                    Pakistan.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I think it's important to add this. When Shoddy was there with Kennedy,
                    they discussed what could be done within the context of the existing treaties,
                    the original one and then as modified in 1955. Kennedy suggested the possibility
                    of a four man meeting, two from the United States and two from Panama. Kennedy
                    said, “I see no reason why an ambassador and General Fleming couldn't represent
                    the United States.” Shoddy suggested that the foreign minister, Galileo Solis,
                    and a former foreign minister, Octavio Faberga, could represent Panama. We met.
                    Very formal, short. We met for 13 months. We accomplished absolutely
                    nothing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Anything that Panama suggested the United States turnedown.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this on your part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: This was out of Washington. Panama requested adjustments that actually
                    were quite modest. They wanted a corridor (This is what you mentioned earlier.)
                    to the canal zone on the populated Pacific side. Well, we finally got the
                    bridge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was on the Caribbean side, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, that was on the Pacific side. But on the Colon side, it was so
                    simple to put something across there. That could have been done, but that was
                    not done. They wanted admittance into the Zone of Panamanian enterprise, which
                    was kept out. “No way” said Washington. They wanted a small increase in their
                    share of the revenues. It began with money, money, money. That was turned down.
                    They wanted a portion of the 10 mile wide zonal strip not being used at this
                    time by the United States. There were lots of areas that weren't being used.
                    That was turned down. And a continual flag alongside as ordered in 1960.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Look, when a telegram comes out of Washington, who has sent it? I don't
                    know. I had plenty of problems in the Dominican Republic about this. Who sent
                    that? Who said “Pay more attention to your client and less attention to Castro?
                    Who wanted to send that? Those things can slip by very easily, but they're all
                    signed by the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling for the Pentagon per se, the
                        military? Pentagon lawyers are notorious for trying not to set precedents or
                        give an inch. Did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I can't believe this came out of the... I know Bob Fleming was 100%
                    behind all of this. It was part of the conference. When we sent that in [with]
                    our recommendation [it came back] approved.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Q: When you would sit around with your officers at the embassy and Governor
                    Fleming, etc., was there the general feeling that, “Gee, at some point, we've
                    really got to make adjustments. This situation isn't going to go on forever.
                    Let's try to preempt it?”</p>
                <p>FARLAND: On the part of the embassy, yes. In good conscience, I couldn't say that
                    this should continue in perpetuity the way it is now. The United States didn't
                    put that in perpetuity into the treaty. That was Belo Beria, who whether they
                    like it or not was the ambassador from Panama. It was also ratified by the
                    Asemlaya twice, which I'm sure they'd like to forget, but it's a fact. They say
                    he wasn't a Panamanian. Well, he wasn't. But he was their representative.</p>
                <p>I know there was one other officer on Ed's staff, a lady, who was equally adamant
                    against the Panamanians. I don't remember her name. She detested the
                    Panamanians. Why this animosity? I don't know. I can't even think of anything
                    funny to say about it.</p>
                <p>Q: No. Sometimes this happens. Sometimes, particularly Washington operators learn
                    to throw their weight around. With some countries, you can't throw your weight
                    around because the repercussions are pretty obvious and they aren't really
                    sovereign. In a way, Panama was perhaps a little too helpless and it brought out
                    the bully in some Washington operators who wanted to prove that they were real
                    tough negotiators. Some of the African states, the smallest African states,
                    sometimes have found the people in Washington saying, “Well, we really ought to
                    sock it to Sierra Leone,” whereas they wouldn't dare do it to Nigeria. It's sort
                    of a nasty thing that is a personality problem of really the bully.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was appalled that my friend, a man named Champ Sourd, a Panamanian,
                    was asked, “How is this going to be advertised?” The lack of friendship, the
                    lack of love, in the broadest sense. Even if you're against it, you could
                    congratulate the people on what they're trying to do, but if you only point out
                    what was the matter, that is... It still disturbs me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 2, 2000. You've left Panama. You're
                        back.What were you doing when you left Panama? You went back into
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Let me add just a few words. You asked me a question heretofore and I
                    couldn't think of the man's name. The DCM in Panama when I arrived was John
                    Shillock. John was a highly competent Foreign Service officer who in the
                    beginning, unfortunately, had made an opinion that was not being particularly
                    appreciative of my appearance on the stage. At the end, he and I became the
                    closest friends. I have seen him subsequently and we still are. He was totally
                    in accord with my policy at the end.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Q: By the time you left there and from what you've heard subsequently, did you
                    feel that the idea that the governor of the Canal Zone, the head of South
                    Command, and the ambassador agreed that these three should really cooperate or
                    did it just depend on personality?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: The three of us cooperated. Before I went down, I secured an agreement
                    from the President of the United States that, in the event of a disagreement
                    between me or the ambassador and the governor of the Canal Zone, the matter
                    involved would be submitted to him for final judgement. We had to have some way
                    of reaching an accord. Not talking was absolutely absurd. It played directly
                    into the hands of the Panamanians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in this period? You left there in
                        1963. ThNixon campaign started in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I went back feeling a little bit disheartened with the State Department
                    and the treatment that I had received. I decided I was not going to go back into
                    any major business such as coal. I was offered at a later time... This was after
                    my other assignment-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's only talk about this 1963-1969 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was offered the opportunity to go on the board of education. I turned
                    it down. I felt I was walking into a situation comparable to what I walked into
                    at the State Department. There were a great number of retired men who wondered
                    why in the dickens, here comes an outsider as a director in one of the
                    subsidiary companies looking towards being a director of the main board. I had
                    been through that in the State Department and I was darned if I was going to go
                    through it again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you occupied?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Eisenhower asked me to take over People to People. I dithat. Actually, I
                    was trying to save it from oblivion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was People to People?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That was one of Eisenhower's concepts of trying to get people together
                    in many ways. One was by letter writing; by people traveling between countries;
                    by the Good Ship Hope; by medicine getting back after going out. It was people
                    to people. It was sponsored primarily by the president of Hallmark Cards, who
                    was a great devotee of Eisenhower's.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I did that for a year or so, fortuitously. I found it interesting,
                    although I was trying to salvage what was going downhill pretty fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in any other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That had an affiliation with Georgetown at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was on the board of Shenandoah University and on a board of West
                    Virginia University (not the main board). Subsequently, I was on the board of
                    the Regents of Georgetown. I had always been interested in education. This was a
                    natural thing for me to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon ran successfully in 1968. Did you get involved with
                        thcampaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Very slowly, very gingerly. I did. I finally ended up on the board of
                    the Republican National Finance Committee and tried to raise money for the
                    campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved either emotionally or otherwise in
                        thVietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, I did not. I saw it. My wife and I had traveled in Europe and seen a
                    lot of young men who had left the country for the purpose of not serving. I felt
                    it. You couldn't read a paper without realizing what was going on. I was
                    concerned about it. But since I was outside of government, there was not much
                    that I could do to affect it.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the Republican Finance Committee? The next time,
                    when it was the reelection in 1972, it became quite controversial.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had served on it previously under Jareman. It was a hard sell and they
                    were at it. I didn't come into contact with anything like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>One other thing I did, I went out... This was in New York where I was working and
                    I was going back to Washington. I got back to Washington one night and they
                    asked me to please go out to Chicago. This was the last thing they were going to
                    ask me to do. Save a dinner, the last dinner for Nixon out there. I said, “I'm
                    tired. I've just come back from New York.” “Well, we have to save this dinner.
                    It's going to be a bust if we don't.” So, I said, “I need 12 or so girls out
                    there to do some phoning. I'll have to set up a phone back to do this. [Get] a
                    hold of somebody's phone bank out there, so that has to be arranged.” That was
                    done. I sold the tickets. I wanted warm bodies. I didn't care about the money. I
                    didn't go to the dinner. I went to bed. I went home and said, “That's enough.
                    I'm through.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with Nixon's inner group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They were as far a distance from me as from here tChicago. just knew the
                    people on that finance committee.</p>
                <p>Q: In November of 1968, Nixon won a very close election. By this time, you
                    certainly were a veteran diplomat. I would assume that you would hope for
                    something.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: My wife wasn't too enthusiastic. I really didn't have any great push
                    about it. We had the riots in Washington after the death of Martin Luther King.
                    I felt that I wanted to get out of Washington. The town was growing and it
                    wasn't the same town that I knew when I first went there years before. I was
                    [longing for] the country life, frankly. I sold my house on Massachusetts Avenue
                    and rented an apartment at the Watergate, two townhouses really, at a reasonable
                    price, with the idea of, if there wasn't something offered to me, we could
                    consider it. Anyway, I was out of the house and I was going to Virginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have a home in Berryville, Virginia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Not at that time, although I do now. We subsequently built a house in
                    Winchester, Virginia. That is where my wife died. We previously stayed at a big
                    property. It was too much for two people. We gave that to ship Hope.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Operation Hope is a medical ship that goes around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't know whether they've turned it into a good thing onot. It was a
                    good property. We couldn't handle it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon comes in January 20, 1969. What happens?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>FARLAND: I had some feelings about the possibility of an ambassadorial
                    assignment. But nothing tangible. I didn't go out seeking it. I don't know what
                    the date was, but I was called into the Department. [They] said, “Argentina. How
                    does that hit you?” Not one way or the other, but I said, “I'll talk to my
                    wife.” My secretary had been born in Argentina. When I told her, she was
                    ecstatic.</p>
                <p>Then about two weeks later, I get a call one night from Al Haig saying
                    “Pakistan.” I looked over at my wife and said, “Pakistan” and she shrugged. I
                    said, “Okay” and that was that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Pakistan from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was in Pakistan from 1969-1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time, you were an old hand. You went to the
                        Department,I assume, to get briefed on Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: As an old hand, I was getting a good briefing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew what to ask.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I knew what to ask. Originally, the only person you got to pick was your
                    secretary. By that time, they had switched over to the point where you could
                    pick everybody. In Pakistan, I had to pick three consul generals. I had a stack
                    of efficiency reports in front of me and I didn't know these people from Adam. A
                    consul was there up in Peshawar. I picked a consul for Dacca. The consul in
                    Lahore was still there, but he was leaving, so I had to pick a consul for
                    Lahore. I picked a consul for Karachi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The capital by that time was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It had been moved from Karachi to Islamabad. It was aordinary house. It
                    lacked all the amenities.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you picked a DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I picked my DCM and I picked an extremely fine, competent,high grade,
                    superb Foreign Service officer by the name of Sid Sober.</p>
                <p>Q: Normally, you get these piles of efficiency reports, but the best way to find
                    out is to go out in the corridors and ask people “Who is a good person?”</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes, but that was a disadvantage I was in. I could go out in the
                    corridors, but I wasn't knowledgeable of people who had been in NEA. Joe- (end
                    of tape)</p>
                <p>I looked in that efficiency report for key words and I found in Sid's, “He's apt
                    to be irritating when it comes to decisions. He might not agree.” I said, “I
                    don't want someone to agree. I want someone to say 'No.'” I couldn't imagine a
                    better DCM. He was highly competent. He was an exceptionally good writer and a
                    delightful person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been a Latin American hand. Did you make an effort
                        tget yourself known and plugged into the Near Eastern Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: As best I could during the time that I had for consultation there before
                    I was sent out. I appeared before the Foreign Affairs Committee. It was pro
                    forma. There were only two senators there, the chairman and Senator Aiken. I
                    think there were two men in the audience from the Pakistani embassy and that was
                    it. They asked me a couple of very casual questions and said, “We hope you have
                    a good time in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find at the time when you were dealing with NEA
                        that NEwas pretty well focused on Israeli-Arab relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I got all the attention that I could because Pakistan was the largest
                    embassy in the world excluding Vietnam because of the huge aid program. With the
                    three consulate generals, you know the size of their staff. That is no small
                    embassy. There was a consulate. That didn't require very many people, but there
                    were a few people up there. Then there was the consulate general over in Dacca,
                    which was over 1,000 miles away from us clear across India. That had to be
                    completely self-contained. I felt I was fully satisfied with the reporting and
                    the help out of the Department on Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the desk officer? You were getting a good
                        picturfrom the desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>FARLAND: Not only that, but I heard from Joe Sisco quite often direct, saying “I
                    appreciated that wire. It was highly competent. You gave us a completely new
                    picture,” that sort of pat on the back every now and then.</p>
                <p>Q: Before you went out, other than to keep good relations, were there any issues
                    at the time that you went out where you said “This is a real problem. Can you
                    work on these?”</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Honestly, no, I didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador in India at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Keating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been a senator from New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I might add one of his activities made me call for security
                    investigation.</p>
                <p>Q: We can come to that. Anybody going particularly to Pakistan even more than
                    going to India knows that you're up against a century old conflict between the
                    Hindus and the Muslims, and it's all exacerbated.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I studied it completely. I had a complete briefing. I had friends on the
                    National Geographic and the owner of it. They did a very nice thing. Theprepared
                    for me a Geographic book of all the articles on Pakistan. That gave me a great
                    oversight picture. I'll never forget that kindness. That was delightful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you first arrive in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Let me tell you before that, there is a little factor here that I think
                    you'd be interested in knowing. I went to see Nixon for a final word, a pat on
                    my head, and a picture. I didn't have a picture...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Normally you have a picture with the President which you
                        put oyour piano or your shelf.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>FARLAND: That wasn't the idea. I wanted to know what he had in mind besides the
                    briefing I got over at State, what was his word, what was the big word? The name
                    Pakistan was never mentioned during our conversation. I heard nothing but “Our
                    emphasis should be on the countries known as the east. We have paid too much
                    attention to the countries we know as the west.” I listened to this for 20
                    minutes or so. He said, “That is the way I'm thinking.” I said, “Well, thank you
                    very much. I'll catch up with my wife, who is in Germany, and go on to
                    Pakistan.” So, I finally mentioned Pakistan. I walked out of there saying, “What
                    in the hell is he thinking about? Never mentioning Pakistan at all. Am I being
                    set up for something?” Remember, my background, I was suspicious. The FBI was
                    still at work. I thought something was amiss. I later found out what it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out, did you run across Henry Kissinger?
                        Had yoever met Kissinger before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had met Kissinger at the Center for Strategic and International
                    Studies. I knew him before he had a job. I knew him as “Henry.” Then I saw him
                    later as “Mr. Kissinger.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he there when you were talking to Nixon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, he wasn't there.</p>
                <p>Q: You say you went out with nothing but “Do a good job,” which is the normal
                    course. Sometimes, as you were told “You've got to do something when you go to
                    Panama and the Dominican Republic,” you must have felt... You had clearance.
                    Also, you were to clean up the relationship in Panama. Here you were setting out
                    and were told, “Have a good time.”</p>
                <p>FARLAND: “We should be concentrating on the east.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Do you have any idea what he was talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, but I was suspicious as hell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In retrospect, do you think he was maybe not using
                        Pakistan as tool to get into China, but do you think he was talking about
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: My studies, my research, on Nixon's view of the future leads me to
                    believe that he was thinking about Chinese relations at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Q: Did you get any feel about how Nixon, Kissinger, Sisco, etc. felt about India?
                    India being this huge country, but its leaders usually set the teeth of American
                    officials on edge, particularly Nehru, Mrs. Gandhi, etc.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Mrs. Gandhi eventually didn't like me at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was always very clear that they sort of considered us
                        acountry bumpkins. It's never been a very happy relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Not since 1947. It was split solely on religion and it waa bloody
                    split.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out, did you sense any antipathy towards
                        Indiwithin the Department or were you running across the opposite?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was the opposite, not on the Assistant Secretary of State's level,
                    but on the lower levels there were those that thought that India could do no
                    wrong. Then, of course, there were a few that thought that Pakistanis could do
                    no wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: India either attracts or repels. Most people who deal with
                        thescountries are not indifferent to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No, it's either love or hate.</p>
                <p>Q: When you arrived, for the general reader, what was the state of affairs as it
                    was explained to you in Pakistan, what Pakistan consisted of at that time, who
                    was the ruler, and how our relations were?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I found nothing but good relations. I must tell you this story. We
                    arrived in Karachi in the middle of the night. I was still half asleep, groggy.
                    I was thinking about what the Pakistanis did. I walked down the steps. The plane
                    lights were on. My wife was walking behind me. When I hit the tarmac, my sense
                    of humor went into high gear. I turned around to my wife and said, “I divorce
                    you! I divorce you! I divorce you!” She said, “The hell you say!” [That was] cut
                    out. That is the way we arrived. It is cold there in Karachi at night in the
                    desert. There was a group down from Islamabad. The consulate was out in force.
                    We were terribly tired. We stayed a day or so. I read the lesson at the
                    cathedral and promptly was called to read the lesson and said to never, never
                    again ask the man to read the lesson from the little prayer book, but for
                    Heaven's sake, send to England and get a real book for that lecture, which he
                    did. Then I went on to Islamabad.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Q: I'd like you to go back and go into a professorial mode. Who was the head of
                    the government there? What was the government like as you saw it? What was
                    Pakistan as you saw it?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: The head of the government was the military government, Yaya Khan. He
                    and I got along famously. He had been trained in England at Sandhurst. I got
                    along well with him and the entire organization, including even the head of
                    their secret service.</p>
                <p>Q: You say it's a military government. Was there at least the facade of a
                    parliament, elections, and that sort of thing, or was it just under military
                    rule?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, they were talking about elections and they finally had elections.
                    While I was there, they didn't. It was ruled basically by the Iet, a real
                    dictatorship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bhutto, the father, had been hung, hadn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Indeed. He finally ran and was elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That was after I left. They were in the process and he had one of his
                    lieutenants who was constantly fighting with the United States as the opponent
                    rather than Yaya Khan. I was up in Peshawar one night. Bhutto arrived and
                    brought this guy in. He sat there with his mouth shut. I said, “I am very happy
                    that you brought this man in. He has been making all kinds of vilifications
                    towards me and I'm surprised because I've never seen him before.” He didn't say
                    anything. Later, Bhutto came to this country after his election. I was here, but
                    that poor guy that I was talking about stood up before a lectern in Peshawar and
                    turned on the mike. When he turned on the mike, a bomb exploded and killed him.
                    So, things were a little rough. We had some difficulty with attacks on USIS, but
                    there was really basically nothing at that time.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the classic things within our foreign affairs establishment has been
                    the India-Pakistan War as done by our embassy in New Delhi and our embassy in
                    wherever it was in Pakistan at the time. Did you find yourself rather close on,
                    reading the telegrams that were coming out of New Delhi, responding, and that
                    sort of thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>FARLAND: We, of course, got information out of New Delhi and cables out of the
                    Department. I in turn infoed Delhi on my cables to the Department. One fine
                    morning, my USIA man comes in. He says, “Mr. Ambassador, this is going to shock
                    you. This is in 'The New York Times.'” I read it. I said, “These are my words.
                    That was in my cable. Those are the exact words.” So, I forthwith sent a [cable]
                    over to the Department demanding an investigation. I knew that somebody had
                    leaked. In abut two hours (and of course an info of that went to Delhi), I got
                    an info from Delhi of a telegram to the Department from Keating saying, “Mea
                    culpa.” I found out that he had taken the files home, which you don't do. He had
                    a “New York Times” reporter staying with him, which is unusual. Three, he gave
                    the files to the reporter to copy. What did the Department do about it? Nada
                    (nothing).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keating was a very powerful figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Had that been you or me, we would have been out on our tail. Q: We would
                    have been crucified.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: He gets appointed to Israel later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a fact of life. A very powerful political figure.
                        Hhad clout in New York State and Nixon needed New York State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right. But you would think that a senator woulhave sense enough
                    not to take the files home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Certainly not to give them to a “New York Times”
                        reporter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: What did he think the reporter was going to do with them? For me, it was
                    disgusting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The problem was that Senator Keating always remained a
                        senator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He was one of the boys.</p>
                <p>Q: He was one of the boys as opposed to really engaging as a diplomat. He had the
                    same problem in Israel. Of course, he was getting older, too. He too overly
                    identified with the Israelis.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I just couldn't conceive of anyone doing that.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find that you and your embassy were spending a certain amount of time
                    responding to these info cables from Delhi which could talk about India-Pakistan
                    relations and that you felt you had to say, “Wait a minute. There is another
                    side to this?” Was this an ongoing thing?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't remember anything specific. I presume we did or we just sent our
                    own cables. The night it started, I was in the residence. We were having a
                    blackout all over Islamabad. The Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs appeared
                    and said that the President wanted to see me at the guest house down in
                    Rawalpindi. So, in the dark of the night with all those bullocks moving along in
                    the dark silently, traffic going every which way, without lights, I thought I
                    was going to get killed on the way to see the President. We arrived. Here was
                    the entire military's top with the President in a state of jubilation on the
                    theory that they had made an instant victory. Needless to say, most of them were
                    pretty well soused by that time. I stayed for a little while and finally got
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Yaya Khan have anything to say to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Oh, yes, he was telling me that he wanted me there so that I would know
                    and be able to inform my government that India started the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which war was this? Do you remember when this was and what
                        wathe issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: This was the only war that we had while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when East Pakistan split?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That was tied onto this, but that was a carryover from this. As a matter
                    of fact, Pakistan hadn't surprised the Indians. In no time flat, the Indians
                    were just knocking the living daylights out of the Pakistanis. My consul general
                    in Lahore who carefully, happily, and proudly showed me a certificate he had
                    received from the Department for bravery. He was one of the first to sell out as
                    fast as he could get out of there. On the other hand, I had some people who,
                    though one would never suspect it, turned out to be the bravest people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The Indians were about to cut Pakistan in two. Remember,Pakistan was a
                    long-</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about West Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. We're separating East Pakistan, but West Pakistan is where the war
                    was going on. At the time, the Indians' plan was to cut through, separate, north
                    and south, so that Islamabad and the area north would be separated from Karachi
                    in the south. There was also this bloodshed starting over in East Pakistan. The
                    West Pakistanis got pretty rough. There was a lot of bloodshed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That now is Bangladesh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes. The truth of the matter is, the Bengalis had nothing in common with
                    West Pakistan except the religion. They were neither similar in shape, size, or
                    anything. Religion was the only thing they had in common. It wasn't enough to
                    hold them together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening militarily? How were we responding in
                        thWest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Other nations were pulling their embassies out. I was told to stay. We
                    were down to practically the United States being the only one there. I was
                    hanging on there in case there was a breakthrough and Islamabad was overrun
                    basically by thugs from Rawalpindi looking for TV sets, etc. I was the one that
                    was going to get the blame. I was trying to establish without making any fear in
                    the embassy an escape route. That had to be through Murree and into Afghanistan
                    and hopefully out of there. This was pretty hairy for good old Joe, I'll tell
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the military attaches at this

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: There wasn't too much activity from the military attaches except for
                    Chuck Yeager, who was on fire. I have accused him of this jokingly (maybe not
                    too jokingly) that perhaps he took an F-4 up there and did a little practicing
                    himself. He had close contact with the Air Force and kept me thoroughly advised
                    as to what was going on. Pakistan was rapidly losing that war. I sent out five
                    FLASHs one day, which is unheard of. Nixon chose his hand by tilting towards
                    Pakistan. But then I got a direct order to go see Yaya and tell him to call off
                    the war. One bright day, I had to get in the car without the flags flying and go
                    down to his bungalow [and] the foreign ministry and tell him he had to call off
                    the war, that he was the loser. That was quite an activity for an ambassador of
                    a foreign country to tell the president of another country, but I did. On the
                    way back, we were being bombed. I finally got under a tree so that they wouldn't
                    see the car. Bombs were falling around the area. One thing nice about the
                    bombing was that they didn't bring in telegrams to me in the middle of the
                    night. I got to sleep. As long as they were bombing, I got to sleep. But this
                    was no fun really. This was scarey.</p>

                <p>Q: Had you been apprised of the fact that a war was going to start? Were we
                    getting information that India and Pakistan were on the verge of war? Were we
                    following it?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I was pretty sure that something was going to happen, yes. Yes, I knew
                    it was close. I was even shown their nuclear plant. I even got into that. I must
                    have a sympathetic face or something. I've done things that are almost
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the cause of this war as we saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Kashmir was always the cause of it. It always will be. 80% are Muslim in
                    Kashmir. The Indus River in the Hindu religion is a goddess. Here you have a
                    country in which your goddess is your main source of water. You can't have it.
                    Kashmir has been the flashpoint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there and subsequently, did you go often over
                        tEast Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I tried to make a point of being there more than any other ambassador
                    ever had been. I did that purposely because they felt that they were not part of
                    Pakistan. I wanted them to feel that I had a definite interest. I flew back and
                    forth over India every whipstitch. Archer Blood was my consul general over
                    there. When the Bengalis revolted, he revolted also. The embassy wasn't taking
                    care of him properly. Had I been in his place, I would have felt that way, too,
                    1,000 miles away. They were far, far away from us. I can understand his feeling.
                    I am sure he felt that I was not sympathetic. I say this now and I felt then
                    that basically I was sympathetic to him. I more than likely would have done the
                    same thing if I had been in his place.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting reports and also were you seeing on the ground as you went
                    there the fact that the West Pakistani army was being particularly brutal
                    towards the Bengalis?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had some reports. I complained to Yaya. I told him. He said, “No.” I
                    went over. They showed me their intake stations where they were taking care of
                    their people. It was a sham. They had all the signs in English for people who
                    didn't speak English. That was for my benefit. That was a complete bungle. There
                    was no love between the two of them. I know that and it's regrettable.
                    Bangladesh is a basket case.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find yourself under any direction or instructions from Washington,
                    either from the White House or from the State Department, that it was our policy
                    that Pakistan should hold together?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I got that from the White House. My job was to save West Pakistan. That
                    was paramount.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this war that the Indians were beginning to
                        win, did you see it in the cards that somehow or another India would absorb
                        all of Pakistan, which would seem to be an almost indigestible lump to try
                        to include in a greater India? Did this seem to be Indian policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't know what their policy was. From my standpoint, I think they
                    were happy to have them off by themselves. That is unfortunately going to be a
                    sore spot for years to come. India has the resources and the manpower to squash
                    West Pakistan. That is why West Pakistan wants an atomic bomb. I knew they were
                    getting it. There was always some question coming out of Washington, saying,
                    “Well, we don't know.” I knew damn good and well they were getting it. They were
                    close to it anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When a rather famous tilt towards Pakistan came-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Gibson sent the fleet around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he sent the Enterprise, a nuclear carrier, up into

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I think it stopped the Indians from breaking up Pakistan. I think it
                    helped to, at least. It was a lot, I must admit that. It was pretty much of a
                    threat. We were about going to World War III over this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't this seem to be a bit excessive, our posturing on
                        thiIndia-Pakistan thing? It was interesting, but I didn't see that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I thought it was a big deal, let's put it that way. Remember, I was
                    sitting there wondering whether or not we were going to be overrun. I was
                    thinking of how I was going to get these people out. So, I was [responsible for]
                    the lives of those that I had under my command, so to speak.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: The foreign minister was Shaktan Han, a very fine man. After we broke
                    the veneer of two separate nations, two separate nations, and two different
                    cultures, we got to be close friends.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when Bangladesh was created?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was happening. Probably at the end of it when I left... It was in the
                    process, yes. When Arch Blood moved out, that was a break right there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't recall it. Did you request that Blood be
                        moved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: At the end, he said, “Well, I stand on this.” I said, “Arch, what you've
                    done is, I can't very well bring you into West Pakistan into our group thinking
                    here. Your actions - and I'm not condemning those actions as such - but I had no
                    warning of this and you can't say that I wasn't attentive to the needs of East
                    Pakistan. I was there more than any other ambassador ever had been. I traveled
                    more. I traveled clear down to Chittagong and to Coxis Bazaar.”</p>
                <p>I liked the Bengalis. At the time of the hurricane, which we'll come to, I was
                    talking to one Bengali who was a professor. I said, “The whole world is
                    concerned about what's going on. You all don't seem to care.” He said, “Why
                    should we? Regardless of the number killed, that is just fewer mouths to feed.
                    Within weeks, they'll be replaced.” That is a heck of an attitude. Maybe it's
                    part of the religion, I don't know. Not mine.</p>
                <p>Q: Was Islamic fundamentalism a factor at that time or did that come later?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Not in the way it is now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do when things got tough while you were still

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It kept going until Arch pulled out and that was the end of that. I'd
                    gone over and talked to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who had spent most of his life in
                    jail. I found him a very reasonable person. I had a long talk with him. He was
                    willing to talk. I knew there were difficulties, but I didn't realize it had
                    come to the head that Arch perceived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a hurricane. Did that happen during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>FARLAND: I had a hurricane and I also had my friend Kissinger. One fine night in
                    the mouth of the Ganges, a tidal wave came rolling in out of the Indian Ocean
                    and inundated that whole area down there and killed that night by drowning
                    anywhere from 350-500,000 people. It was unbelievable! When I got that word, my
                    first thought was “What can we do to help on this?” I was in Islamabad. I had
                    ordered the plane service to prepare to fly. I called a top meeting of AID and
                    alerted them, asked what they could do, and told them whatever facilities they
                    had, to get them ready for action. We had a huge emergency on our hands and we
                    had to be there firstest with the mostest. That resulted in the acquisition of a
                    number of C-130s, a lot of emergency biscuits, tents, all that sort of thing.
                    That had to be collected.</p>
                <p>I flew immediately over to Dacca and stayed with Arch. He and his wife couldn't
                    have been greater help to me. I got in touch with our Air Force base and asked
                    for five helicopters. They sent them over in a C-141 from the States with crew
                    forthwith. They arrived. They were put together. I was the first one down there.
                    We had emergency blankets. It was token, but I wanted the people there in the
                    drama that were still alive to see that there was action coming to help them. We
                    flew down there these helicopters, circled around all over the place, stopped at
                    one point, and people came up out of the ground. That is the way they do. I
                    don't know where they come from, but they're there. They were frightened of us.
                    They were scared to death. [They had been] through Hell. So, we put the blankets
                    down and went back and took off. They got into one hellacious fight over those
                    blankets. It looked like they were killing each other. Then the newspeople
                    started to arrive. We tried to organize the distribution of emergency biscuits
                    that the Army has and rice. Russia started coming in with rice in their type of
                    crafts that were somewhat like a C-130. I was going back and forth. There was no
                    incident of outbreak of flu, diphtheria, plague, or anything like that. They
                    were either dead or alive. Those that were alive were more careful to boil the
                    water than they had been before. They knew that the water had been contaminated.
                    I hate to even think about the pictures in my mind of the dead that were heaped
                    all over that place.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the press got down there. We tried to [feed] as many as we could. We had
                    rice made up into what amounted to 10 pound bags. The women in the embassy made
                    a bag and we filled up a C-130 with that. I took a lot in a helicopter. We
                    landed and tried to distribute it. They had started crowding the helicopter. We
                    knew that somebody was going to get killed, so we took off and just dropped it.
                    There was no control of the crowd. There was one stringer who proceeded to say
                    I, being a politician, made him shake hands before I would give them rice, which
                    was absurd! In the first place, he didn't speak Bengali. How did he know I was
                    saying that. I was trying to pass out rice. Anyway, that was the headlines all
                    over the world and that has hurt me ever since. It hurts me now. I got
                    affidavits from the helicopter crew and I called in the AP man. I said, “You
                    know me. You know I wouldn't do that. Why did you take that stringer's advice?”
                    He said, “Well, it looked like a good story.” I said, “Well, send a
                    contradiction out.” He said, “What good will that do? It's already in print.”
                    That cut.</p>
                <p>Q: That is unfortunate. Did the Indian government do anything about this?</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>FARLAND: I didn't see any Indians. Yaya Khan got there seven days after I did. He
                    said, “So, you've been here for a while.” I said, “Yes, seven days.”</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel while this was developing that our consulate general with Arch
                    Blood as consul general was maybe a little too close to the insurgent movement
                    of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I did not. Both he and his wife were very helpful. They gave a weiner
                    roast or something for the visiting newspeople. But it was one of the saddest
                    things that I've ever been in.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you doing anything prior to this... When you had been in the Dominican
                    Republic, you had been in contact with the underground. Was there any cause for
                    you as the ambassador to be in contact with the Bangladeshi opposition that was
                    developing?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: From my standpoint, no, there was no cause for that, no suggestion on
                    the part of anybody. I did make one effort with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who had
                    been a very active anti-everything. We had a nice conversation. He had been in
                    jail most of his life, but he seemed to be reasonable enough in talking. I
                    presume if there was anything of that nature, that this would be [the consul
                    general's] job to find out. I had no indication of the emergency as it finally
                    arose.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: The CIA was not too involved.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: In the beginning, when I first got there, they were very much a factor.
                    After I had been there about six months, I was moving closer and the engine was
                    moving back. The Soviets were seeking forever and always will an outlet on the
                    Gulf or the Indian Ocean.</p>
                <p>Q: This has always been part of the great game. When one looks at the fleet and
                    all, it seems to be a real stretch to think that you could do much with lines of
                    communication being such that...</p>

                <p>FARLAND: The head of the KGB in Afghanistan was then moved over to Islamabad as
                    the ambassador. He was the head of the KGB in both instances. Even the one that
                    dug the tunnel through the mountains that [got] him to the capital. We built a
                    highway down towards the Gulf. That was very convenient from their

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They were a big outfit and they had all the troubles that a gigantic
                    outfit would. They considered themselves to a large extent removed from the
                    embassy. They didn't like the ambassador giving orders to the [AID Director].
                    For instance, in Pakistan, it was expected when you went into an office that
                    yohad your coat on. They were very formal. I told the officers, “When you are
                    expecting a Pakistani official to call at your office, put on your coat, for
                    Heaven's sakes.” That went down like a lead balloon, but they put their coats
                    on.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the criticisms of AID has always been that when it comes in, the
                    infrastructure often gets huge. These are Americans. They set up offices. A lot
                    of our money that we supposedly give to the country ends up by the salaries, the
                    housing, and the maintenance of Americans, as opposed to translating it into
                    actual elements that are of benefit to the country. You came in with an
                    experienced eye. Did you look at this?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I saw. It was one of the largest embassies and it was primarily AID.
                    They were trying to make rivers run uphill. This is a little difficult, even in
                    the best of circumstances. There were a lot of things they could do on a lesser
                    scale which would be quite productive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Panama, you were talking about doing small dirt roads

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They were so big over there that it was past that stage. They were into
                    dams. This wasn't their project, but there was a dam being built on the Indus.
                    It was one of the largest American dams ever built. All of their projects were
                    huge. It was beyond my control at that point.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: Pretty well. I'd give it a C+ or a B-. It got a lot of public exposure.
                    I don't want to say too much. They were doing their part, but that is about
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I think there was that. Most of their books were in English. In East
                    Pakistan, that was fine from the educational standpoint for the educated, the
                    university types. Most of those people were not educated. Most of them spoke
                    Bengali. Not many of the Americans spoke Bengali. We had a consul general in
                    Karachi who spoke it fluently. I must say that was perhaps his only asset.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you underimpressed or impressed by the support you were getting from your
                    consulates general? We've already talked about the one in Dacca, which is a
                    special case, a very strong person who was making his case for a very difficult
                    situation. What about in Peshawar and Karachi?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: In Peshawar, I had a consul up there. It was a very small group. He did
                    a great job. He had as a part-time employee a former major general in the
                    [Pakistani military], from whom I still get Christmas cards. A very fine person.
                    He had a wife who was exceptional, too, I might add. Together they did
                    particularly well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: He could have done better, I thought. I thought his wife did
                    exceptionally well. He objected to any criticism. When we were going to have a
                    party when I was there, one of the first things to do is to check to make sure
                    all the lights work and the toilet paper is there. This upset him. He had his
                    faults, but he had other assets that weren't too apparent.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: They had a sizeable embassy in Islamabad.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: We were watching them. I presume our CIA was watching them. They were
                    watching us. We were watching the Russians and they were watching us. I'd go to
                    a meeting or a party and the Chinese ambassador was there. We somehow or another
                    met like ships in the night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Kissinger-Nixon connection with
                        China. Thiwas a major event. Can you tell the story?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It's quite a story, too. I was in my office one day with my faithful,
                    ever-present secretary, Eleanor Taylor, whose value to me as ambassador and to
                    the United States government as a secretary cannot be overstated. She was
                    superb. She was the wife of a political officer by the name of Henry Taylor. A
                    navy attache from Karachi came in with an envelope. He said, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    this is for you” and he turned around and walked out. I opened it up and it
                    said, “Back channel communication.” Back channel means it did not go through the
                    State Department. Actually, this channel was a super-secret navy channel that
                    had several names. One of them was SR-1. It was sent to Karachi by the naval
                    attache there. He had to hand carry it up to me. The gist of that telegram was
                    that he, Kissinger, wanted me to meet him, presumably in California, at a later
                    date, of which I would be advised. Be prepared to travel early. Boy! That was
                    the first back channel communication I had ever gotten. Secondly, didn't he know
                    that I don't leave my post without permission of the Secretary of State? I got a
                    second one saying, “You will travel on such and such a date. Meet me in
                    California.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: San Clemente? This was Nixon's California White
                        House.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>FARLAND: I didn't know where I was going to meet him in California. Another
                    communication followed, to wit that I would travel [to a] private airport and
                    ask for plane number such and such and they would take me to the destination.
                    This was about as mysterious as you can get. I still didn't have permission to
                    travel. So, I sent a back channel telegram to Kissinger stating something to the
                    effect that “I don't know what the circumstances are. Normally, I would get
                    permission from the Department of State. If that isn't reasonable under the
                    circumstances, then have Al Haig from New York send me the following telegram,”
                    which I then spelled out a charade (to be perfectly frank, a lie). I hate like
                    the Devil to do that. This is not the way I live. I'm still mad about it. To
                    wit, “The sale of the coal land which you had to so and so is proceeding
                    uneventfully. However, one factor has occurred. So and so's, the finder's, fee
                    to us seems to be exorbitant. Your presence in the States is absolutely
                    essential for the solution of this problem. Signed James Meenon.” Oh, I hated
                    that. I sent this triumphant [telegram] through the Pakistani [post]. So, in
                    comes a telegram with that message on it. It goes through the mailroom and the
                    mail clerk comes down anhands it to Eleanor Taylor, saying, “Looks like the
                    boy's made another seven million dollars.” It was my telegram. So, I had to code
                    that and send it to the Department asking for permission to travel. Any travel
                    voucher has to be coded.</p>
                <p>Time passes. I don't get a reply. I can't wait. I've decided I'm going,
                    permission or not. So, I went down to Karachi. The telegrams come in there and
                    then they're forwarded. In the middle of the night, I got it and then went on.
                    This was cutting it awfully fine. I stopped that night in Hong Kong. As luck
                    would have it, I bumped into a fellow I knew from Panama. He said, “What are you
                    doing?” I said, “I'm on my way to Washington on consultation.” I left the next
                    morning. The next day, I went to Los Angeles. I got in there in the morning and
                    went to the airport, asked for that number plane. It was a lovely twin engine
                    jet. I was the only person aboard. Being a former FBI agent, I was trying to
                    figure out whose plane this was. I was looking in the ashtrays to see if there
                    were any paper matches or anything else. It appeared that it was Sinatra's
                    plane.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Right. I couldn't say it was his plane, but I had reason to believe it
                    might be. So, we landed at Palm Springs. That is a local watering place out
                    there.</p>

                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>FARLAND: There was a little black car there with a man. I went over and he said,
                    “Are you Meenon?” I said, “Yes.” So, I got in the car. I got to the house and
                    saw some big men standing around. They looked like Secret Service people. I saw
                    Henry was out on the patio with a drink in his hand. He was in a sport shirt and
                    was relaxed. I was anything but relaxed. I said, “Henry, I've comhalfway around
                    this damn earth and I don't know why.” He said, “I want you to put me into
                    China.” I said, “I don't think that's very funny, Henry.” He said, “It's not
                    funny. You know it. Haig knows it. Nixon knows it. I know it.” I said, “I didn't
                    ask for this job.” He said, “You are going to do it.” I said something about
                    “Don't be so damned dictatorial. I'm not up to that yet.” We talked for a while.
                    I calmed down a bit. It was still exasperating in no uncertain terms. I said,
                    “Look, Henry, you fly west of K-2, the Russians are going to pick you up on
                    their radar. There is no question about this. If you fly east of the K-2, the
                    Indians have got you pegged.” How are you going to get into China?” He said,
                    “That is for you to figure out.” I said, “I need about three days. Henry, I've
                    got a solution. In three days, I can hide you at Murree.” Murree is a British
                    hill station that is about 7,500 feet outside of Islamabad north in the
                    foothills of the Himalayas. Fortunately, there was a big cottage up there that
                    somehow or another the embassy had the rights to. It had a phone connection with
                    the embassy. So, I figured I could hide him there. That was the first thought
                    that came to mind. So, we talked for a while. He said, “You figure it out. I'm
                    coming through. I will be stopping in Pakistan, at which time I want to go into
                    China.” On the way back, I thought of nothing else but how to do it.</p>
                <p>I had to get rid of the doctor on my plan. We had a doctor or nurse assigned to
                    the embassy because of the size of the embassy. I had to get rid of him. If I
                    claimed a slight indisposition, he as the doctor would want to be there. So, I
                    arranged for him to go to East Pakistan at that particular time. Sid Sober was
                    too diddly darn bright for me to try to hide this from. So, I sent him on
                    vacation. The head of the USIA there was a very intelligent person who wanted to
                    pry into everything. I didn't want him prying into this, so I got him out. I
                    forget where I sent him. Not that it made any difference, but my wife was in the
                    States at that time anyway, so I had plenty of space in the house, but that
                    wasn't necessary. I eliminated as many as I could. I was down to a man by the
                    name of Dennis Kux, a very, very bright young guy. He damned near blew it, too,
                    I might add. Then I had arranged that when he was in the air, I would take a
                    Cessna up to Murree with trumpets blaring, flags flying, and everything else,
                    and then call back and cancel all the plans for parties and so forth that I had
                    set up. That worked out fine.</p>
                <p>My biggest hurdle was to get Kissinger from Islamabad into China. I knew that the
                    Paks almost had a daily run by air in 707s, the PIA (Pakistan International
                    Air). But I don't have permission to discuss this with anybody. I had to put it
                    over my head. This was where I stood at that point.</p>
                <p>I would like to catch up on some of the history. In 1969, I came over there, to
                    Pakistan. In 1967, Kissinger was becoming interested in better relations with
                    China and made some public statements to that effect. From 1954 on, there had
                    been 134 meetings trying to work out some kind of arrangement.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: And Poland and everywhere else. Then came the invasion of Cambodia. So,
                    that broke that previous chain at the State Department. This is what Nixon and
                    Kissinger wanted. This was God-given as far as they were concerned. They wanted
                    that break. Kissinger made one attempt through General Vernon Walters with a
                    contact in Paris, but that did not work. Finally, a channel was chosen after
                    months of overeager signal sending by Washington. This was, as I previously
                    described, through Pakistan. The amazing thing about this was that, at that
                    point, neither Secretary Rodgers or the State Department were in any way

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They had talked to the Chinese. The Chinese, of course,were very close
                    to the Paks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work out? You still had to get an
                        airplane.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right. At that juncture, the foreign ministers of China,
                    Pakistan, Romania, and the Soviet Union all knew that the Americans were acting
                    on a mission to China, but the State Department didn't know it. That is
                    unconscionable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. This is Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: On April 21, 1971, [a] message [was sent] through the bacchannel stating
                    “The Chinese government-” (end of tape)</p>
                <p>“Publicly, in Peking, a special envoy of the President of the United States (for
                    instance, Mr. Kissinger) or the United States Secretary of State or even the
                    President of the United States himself for a direct meeting.” So, here we had a
                    real initial contact between the United States and China.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Nixon thought about going. Kissinger didn't want him to. This was Kissinger's
                    play. He played it for all it was worth. March 3, when I got that back
                    channel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying in April the Chinese government sent this.

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That was April 21 that the Chinese government sent... OMarch 3 is when I
                    went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we didn't know that the Chinese had accepted it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, it had to be after.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Anyway, on June 2nd, Zhou En-lai approved Kissinger's trip and expressed
                    Chairman Mao's pleasure at receiving Nixon sometime soon thereafter. At that
                    point, I was authorized to talk to Yaya. I went down and said, “Hi, I have
                    something very serious to talk to you about, Yaya.” He grinned. I said, “Do you
                    know what I'm going to talk about?” He said, “I think I do.” I said, “Has
                    somebody been talking to you?” He said, “Somebody has been talking.” I said, “I
                    need one of your airplanes to fly to China.” He said, “You have it.” Almost
                    words to that effect. I said, “I don't understand this. I didn't get permission
                    to talk to you until I just came down here.” He said, “Well, they've been
                    talking to my ambassador in Washington.” I almost had a hemorrhage. All those
                    sleepless nights trying to figure out how in the Devil I was going to get him
                    over there. That is the way it was. That is the way it happened. By using a PIA
                    plane, there was no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were having to deal with Yaya. What was your
                        arrangement fothe plane?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>FARLAND: They made constant trips and I told them... He was as aware of the
                    situation as was I at that point, much to my amazement and disgust. On July 9th
                    after my conversation with Yaya, not that that was important, Kissinger back
                    channeled to Zhou En-lai a statement that he would be flying in a Pakistan
                    Boeing aircraft from Islamabad to Peking. Nixon and Kissinger were at each
                    other's throats as to who was going to get to go on this thing. Nixon ordered
                    Kissinger not to put his name on that communique. Kissinger simply ignored it.
                    He was that type. He was bound and determined he was going to get the glory out
                    of it and did. On July 1, 1971, Kissinger started on a fact-finding tour through
                    Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand, India, West Pakistan, and Paris. He got into
                    Kennedy on July 8th. I had a luncheon and dinner for him, an interesting
                    meeting, and so forth. I had all the arrangements for him. There were parties,
                    receptions, all the invitations sent out, etc. Normal procedure.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon of about the second day, a Secret Service man with a big cigar
                    in his mouth came in and stood there and said, “Mr. Ambassador, something screwy
                    is going on here.” That is when I had to lower the boom. This is when the old
                    FBI came back into effect. I said, “Look, my dear friend, I am as responsible
                    for the lives of every American in Pakistan. You and everybody in this trip are
                    my responsibility. I know you are to take care of Kissinger, but I am to take
                    care of you as well as Kissinger. I am telling you right now, buddy, don't you
                    for one minute mess around too close to whatever you think is screwy or you're
                    going to find yourself going back as a tourist on a paid flight and not on the
                    flight you're on. Get that understood right now between us. I am fully
                    responsible for both of you.” He turned around and walked out. Obviously,
                    somebody on that plane talked. It was nobody at the embassy. They didn't know.
                    But he kept quiet. That settled him down.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>That night before Kissinger's departure in the morning of the 9th, the President
                    had a little dinner party at his bungalow for a very small group. This
                    grouincluded the foreign minister, who was privy to this, Yaya, the head of the
                    army, and I think the head of the air force was there (I'm not sure.), and I was
                    there, and maybe one other person, but that was it. Those were the only ones
                    that knew about this trip, except for my secretary. At 3:30 that morning,
                    Kissinger went to the airport. I was getting my gear together to take Kissinger
                    to Murree. He and his group were going to Chaklala Airport. When he got there (I
                    was not at the airport, but I can tell you this because it is part of the
                    story.), he had three aides: Winston Lord, Richard Sminer, and John Holdridge.
                    At that juncture, the whole deal almost blew up. This is a fact that has been
                    public, but it's not known widely. At that airport at the far corner in the
                    military section for reasons unknown, there was a newspaper man by the name of
                    Beg. Beg is a stringer for “The London Telegram.” He saw Kissinger and asked an
                    official what was going on. The official told him and the guy ran to a telephone
                    and called London. The editor, having had dealings with Beg in the past, figured
                    he was drunk and canned the story. That is how close that came to blowing up.
                    The Boeing was manned by two Chinese pilots and a Chinese navigator. That scared
                    a couple of the small group nearly to death, including the Secret Service men
                    who were with us (There were two of them.). On Friday that afternoon, they
                    landed in Beijing.What was I doing? I was heading a parade that was going up the
                    hill to Murree with flags flying. There had been one change in the program. The
                    President suggested instead of stopping at Murree, go on about 20 miles to
                    Nagiagali, which is another rest home that is fully outfitted and which was
                    prepared to take care of us. I said, “I'm all set at Murree.” He said, “The
                    other one is farther away, which means better security.” I said, “I couldn't
                    agree with you more.” So, we went to Nagiagali. I turned around, drove back to
                    Murree, got on the phone, called the embassy, and told my secretary, Mrs.
                    Taylor, “Believe it or not, Kissinger is suffering from a slight indisposition
                    (and that is the word that went around the world.). No problem, but cancel all
                    arrangements. He will be back in time to continue his flight.”</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>So, that was my part to be played. I played it. I told the Secret Service men in
                    the group, “Do not drink the water unless it's boiled. Remember, we're at 10,000
                    feet here. It takes longer for water to boil. If it isn't boiled, you're going
                    to get a stomach full of bugs that you won't like.” Well, one of the Secret
                    Service men the day we were supposed to leave got so damned sick I thought we
                    were going to lose him. What a way to end up the whole thing, with a Secret
                    Service man who has got Delhi belly! So, he got a hold of a doctor someplace who
                    didn't know whether he was treating Nixon, Kissinger, me, or what. He didn't
                    know anybody. He gave him a shot of something and got him on his feet. With a
                    sick six footer, we started down the hill. I thought, “Well, that's over.” We
                    got down to where Kissinger was supposed to meet us and no Kissinger. I couldn't
                    stop there. I went on to the President's rest house, where Kissinger was
                    staying. Pretty soon, Dennis Kux arrived. “Where is Kissinger?” I said, “Dennis,
                    that stupid ass is up there in the Murree bazaar arguing about some horrible
                    piece of rug or something, looking for bargains. I wasn't going to stand up
                    there with him and make a fool out of myself. If he wants to stay there, that is
                    his business. My business is to come back here, report back, and here I am. I am
                    madder than all get out and I don't like it a bit. This is a hell of a way for a
                    visitor to act.” I put on what might be called a first-class act. I fooled
                    Dennis. I had to keep that up for almost an hour and a half until he finally
                    arrived.While in Peking, they sent back (This, too, really appeals to me.)...
                    The secret code word was “eureka!”</p>

                    States knew that we were successful. On July 13, I was sitting there holding my
                    breath. I still couldn't say anything. Every morning, I was listening to
                    the-</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Oh, yes. I had a frank talk with him about the whole thing. He told me,
                    “I got everything I wanted.” It was a total success on my part. I did a
                    beautiful job. I said, “Look, I'm through with this. I've got a hurricane, I've
                    gotten you into China.” Now I want Japan.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>FARLAND: That's what I wanted. “Give me a month in intensive Japanese and I'll
                    have it back. [I was an] interpreter in World War II. I can get it back in a
                    month. I know that subject. He said, “We have something else planned for you.”
                    That was wrong. Nixon announced this. I was listening every morning, glued to
                    that television set I had. On July 15... All that did right then and there...
                    Tokyo had been getting assurances by Washington that there would be no
                    initiatives toward Peking without full consultation. As a result, they made both
                    Taiwan and Japan mad.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: A navy yeoman by the name of Charles Edward Radford, who was on that
                    trip, was a spy. He was a personal aide to Admiral Rembrandt C. Robinson, the
                    top assistant to the Chairman Admiral Thomas H. Moore. Tom Moore and I were
                    longtime friends. Moore knew this whole story.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: What was so libel about this was that Nixon and Kissinger would hardly
                    talk to each other and yet this whole thing was going to the navy. Not only
                    that, but poor [Secretary] Rodgers being completely in the dark about this...
                    There were others besides the navy that knew about it.</p>

                        Secretary for East Asia at the time. He went out with Nixon on the trip to
                        China. He said that when he heard that Kissinger had gone up to this hill
                        station because he had tummy trouble or something, he was at a staff meeting
                        and said, “That doesn't make any sense. That is a long, hard trip. It's
                        bouncy. That is not the place to go.” Then he realized something was

                <p>FARLAND: As soon as I heard this news on the radio, I went over and held a staff
                    meeting and said, “Kissinger was in China, not in Murree” and their faces
                    dropped. They didn't know it. No one at the embassy except Eleanor Taylor knew.
                    Eleanor couldn't have been a better secretary. A man couldn't ask for a better

                    to the Nixon-Kissinger foreign policy and the fact that Yaya Khan had helped
                    bring it on, did that give him extra favor so that when we are talking about

                    going to have to be at least appreciative. Whether that was the cause or not,
                    Nixon tilted and he sure as hell had gotten help from Yaya.</p>

                    should cover on Pakistan?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: One of the three big items of my tenure over there was, I traveled a
                    good deal. The first thing I did (and I advise any officer to do) was study the
                    maps of the country. I read maps religiously. You can get an awful lot of
                    information from a map. As far as Pakistan is concerned, I don't know of
                    anything else. I know I preached in the Christmas shows in the cathedral in
                    Rawalpindi and I nearly froze to death that night. I went back to the embassy
                    and stayed in bed for a week with flu.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Pakistan in 1972. Did you know where you were
                        going?</hi>

                <p>FARLAND: I knew when I left, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you going to do and how did it come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I came back to Washington and began briefing on Iran and waiting for my
                    call from the Foreign Affairs Committee chairman to allow me to be an
                    ambassador. I got a call from one of the people connected with the chairman of
                    the Foreign Affairs Committee. They had seen me enough that they didn't want to
                    see me. I didn't have to come up. So, I was cleared. I had to get over pretty
                    hurriedly because Nixon was going over to see the Shah. So, I had to get
                    acquainted quickly, which I did. But unfortunately, I didn't realize that I had
                    already run into a buzzsaw - one of these situations that are made in the past
                    that suddenly comes up and bites you. An Iranian boy came to West Virginia
                    University. I met him. He was delightful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: This was long before I was in ambassadorial service. It was in the 1950s
                    sometime. His name was Jahanbani. His father had been a general. Naturally, he
                    was an important person. He didn't know why he was at West Virginia University.
                    His child had been run over in an accident in Teheran. His wife wasn't with him
                    and he was very unhappy. We had him to dinner and he finally moved in and stayed
                    with us for a while. I was instrumental in getting his wife over. We became
                    quite good friends. He told me about Iran and so forth. That summer, I took him
                    out to the country. He said, “You know, you ought to strive to be an ambassador.
                    You're the type that should get into that service. You've obviously shown a
                    great deal of sympathy towards foreign students. You've helped me. You should
                    think about that.” Well, I did think about it. So, when I got my appointment to
                    Iran, this was a story that I loved to tell because it was a connection with
                    Iran. What I didn't know was that the foreign minister and the minister of court
                    were violent enemies. They hated each other. I didn't have any idea about that.
                    Secondly, the foreign minister's private secretary is Jahanbani. She was a very
                    brilliant, beautiful member of that family. So there is a foreign minister with
                    a member of the Jahanbani family and here is the minister of court who doesn't
                    like this situation. I am telling the story and the foreign minister hears it
                    and thinks it's great. The minister of court thinks it's awful. He acquires a
                    great deal of hatred for me without ever seeing me.</p>
                <p>Q: When you say “the minister of court,” you're talking about the Shah's minister
                    of court. This was not the legal system. This was the man who runs the Shah's
                    entourage.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right. He was a very important person. Before I got over there,
                    that story had circulated and I had friends on one side and an enemy on the
                    other. So, I ran into that situation when I got there. Nixon came over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't remember. He must not have been. If he had been,I certainly
                    would remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe not. This was in 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That was 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1972-1973.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Before we get to the trip, when you were getting ready to go, what were you
                    getting from the desk and all about... Iran and the Shah were special cases
                    which turned out to be a problem. Were you being told to be extra careful?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't remember a whole hell of a lot about how much I got. I was in
                    such a rush. I got a very casual briefing, to be frank about it. I did a lot of
                    reading and that was it. I was on my way. Nixon sent several advance parties
                    over. This was not a big trip. I think to think of the one Clinton made to
                    Africa with 400 people. I can't believe it. Anyway, he arrived and the Shah...
                    There was trouble going on and they were worried that there would be some upsets
                    along the line. They had five bodyguards for the ambassador. I didn't want any
                    bodyguard. If they wanted to get me, they were going to get me, bodyguard or no.
                    The only thing that made it possible was that I could always get a parking
                    place. That was nice.</p>
                <p>Big embassy, a lot of work. Nixon arrived and the Shah put on the most lavish
                    dinner I've ever seen in my life. I never saw so many diamonds, emeralds, and
                    rubies, so many ambassadors wearing a big line of medals. The American
                    ambassador was without any. The plane lights were hitting Nixon right in the
                    eyes and he couldn't read his speech. He ended up making one heck of a good
                    speech. I was really proud of that. Then the following day, Nixon had a small
                    dinner in one of the palaces and ordered lobster flown in from Maine. Nobody
                    asked me. I just happened to know the Shah was allergic to seafood, shellfish
                    particularly. So, the Shah was pushing his finger around the table quite a lot.
                    It was a reasonably quiet little dinner, not too much said. They went on.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>In the meantime, they had a satellite move over for communications. A red phone
                    direct to... All this costs an awful lot of money. So, I presented to the court.
                    Normally, after a presentation, you go into an anteroom with the Shah and you
                    have maybe 10 minutes to chit chat. I seemed to make an impression on him for
                    some reason or another. One of the things I told him was that one thing I wanted
                    him to know was this: when I got a telegram from State, I would advise him what
                    that said if it was directed to him or to his government, and I also would tell
                    him what I thought personally. He liked that. He kept me for almost 45 minutes,
                    which was unusual. Whether or not he was trying to make an impression on me, I
                    don't know.</p>
                <p>I got along fine with the minister of court, I thought. I know I got along fine
                    with the foreign minister. We had rapport right off the bat. I was doing my best
                    to get acclimated to Iran and to its customs and studying everything I could
                    find. Unfortunately, just at the point where I had reached where the Shah was
                    beginning to trust me, Dick Helms had to oversee the accommodations. Dick said
                    that Nixon suggested Iran. I don't know. I know they offered me... First, they
                    were talking about Greece and then they withdrew that because of Colonel Papas
                    intervening. They offered me five other posts. One was Mexico and that was too
                    far up in the air for my plunk, plus the fact that so much activity is in
                    Acapulco, this being a port.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not good for anybody with a heart problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: No. Then they offered me Argentina. My wife said, “You can go to
                    Argentina. You'll get along fine. You know Senora Peron. You certainly know
                    Peron. But I'm not going. So and so down there now won't go out of the embassy
                    residence because he is afraid of getting shot. Knowing you, you are going to be
                    out with the campesinos or whoever all over the country. I am not going to lose
                    you that way.” Then they offered me Jamaica and I wasn't interested in that.
                    They designated me to New Zealand. My father in law was dying. He by that time
                    had become a big coal operator. My father in law pleaded with me not to go. I
                    was the only one who could possibly take over what he had. There was a lot of
                    money involved in that. It was a big operation. I was back in the State
                    Department listening to some of the briefings. They had a big meeting one day to
                    decide whether or not between the embassy residence and an adjacent hall, the
                    walkway should be curved or should be straight. There were about 12 men sitting
                    there making a decision of that kind. I thought, “No. Here are a number four
                    post. I've had number one post. Listening to a discussion of the curvature of a
                    walkway, I am not interested.”</p>
                <p>Q: Also, having tasted some really raw meat, some difficult things, New Zealand
                    sounds... That's what you do to the inoffensive person with little diplomatic
                    skills. It's a good burial place.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: That's right. With my father in law in the condition he was in... We're
                    talking big money and a piece of mining equipment of $25-30,000 minimum, once it
                    goes into that mine and you bring it out, it's all rusty. It's still in perfect
                    shape, but it's lost 98% of its value. So, I kept going, hemming and hawing. I
                    finally decided “The hell with it. I am not going to go.”</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>The State Department had me posted to New Zealand. I was carrying a card that
                    said, “Seventeen years in the Service. Last post: New Zealand as an ambassador.”
                    I never went to New Zealand. I told the Council of American Ambassadors this and
                    “This is not according to fact,” but the State Department- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Q: Before we see what you did in your post diplomatic time, I would like to go
                    back to Iran. When you were there-FARLAND: I covered that pretty rapidly.</p>
                <p>Q: We covered it too rapidly. One of the concerns was, and it certainly became
                    more apparent later on, Nixon and Kissinger seemed to be delighted with selling
                    as much military equipment as they could to the Shah. It was sort of whatever
                    the Shah wants, he can have. Was there disquiet on your part or the officers of
                    your embassy about what was happening? When military equipment comes in, there
                    are lots of American technicians.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Generally speaking, the officers, particularly the military people, were
                    delighted to see it coming in. I thought they had plenty of it. That was meant.
                    As far as objection to the sale, I never heard an officer complain about it.
                    They were all salesmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was military. How about our political officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: They made no objection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: A fellow who later became ambassador. I cant think of his name. That is
                    awful of me. My effort there at that point was getting acquainted.</p>
                <p>Q: Was your embassy under any constraints on what to report? I'm not sure if it
                    was going at this time, but it became sort of notorious that we had agreed to
                    the Shah that we wouldn't make any contact with opposition. So there were
                    constraints.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had no constraints on that. I let the Shah know my entire background
                    as far as FBI, etc. He was aware of that. I also revealed the fact that the CIA
                    was weekly in contact with the Shah. I indicated that I didn't think that was
                    such a good idea. I told the Shah, but he didn't give it up. I felt that I
                    should be there when that conversation was ensuing if such was going to ensue.
                    But I hadn't reached the point where I could...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really didn't have much of a chance to...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>FARLAND: No. I was just reaching the point where the Shah wabeginning to have
                    faith in me.</p>
                <p>Q: If I recall, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think one reason why Helms was
                    sent to Iran was, in a way, to get him out of the way. There were some problems
                    with the CIA. It was to get him out of the Washington game.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: He wanted out. I don't know exactly why. It was a big difficulty... This
                    was too bad, really. This was strictly from the standpoint of the States. During
                    his hearing before the Foreign Affairs Committee, a friend of his said, “Did the
                    CIA have any activity going in Chile?” Helms said, “No.” That was strictly
                    untrue. They had a hell of a lot of activity going on in Chile, a great deal of
                    it. That was a friendly questioner, somebody that didn't know what to ask. Helms
                    was going back almost weekly to Washington to try to minimize that damage.</p>
                <p>Q: What did you do when you finally left foreign affairs? What sort of things did
                    you become occupied with after you left Iran and you looked at these other posts
                    and decided that you had to take care of your father in law's estate?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: That I had to do. My father in law died. I had some cleanup work to do.
                    We decided the property that he had acquired was more than we wanted and more
                    than the two of us could handle. It was too big. So we remodeled a house in
                    Winchester, Virginia. Then my wife died. I've been very lonesome ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you have. Do you have any general comments at
                        thipoint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I would like to tell you very frankly that I think your project has
                    merit - not from what I'm telling you particularly. I would like to see it
                    somewhere where there can be a closer feeling of contact between the Foreign
                    Service than I was offered, but that was not my handshake. That was the back of
                    somebody's hand that I was getting. Here was a great honor which I would have
                    been glad to accept if it had been a continuation. But that meant the end of my
                    career. I wish there was some way that the Foreign Service and the political
                    appointees could get closer together. How to do that, I don't know. If it were
                    possible for a political appointee to have what I had done, a year's tenure in a
                    lowly position in the Department, that would help. But they are not going to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: No, they are not. This is often offered not because of what the person can do
                    for the foreign affairs, but rather as a reward. It is often because of
                    political contributions or because more and more people who have been involved
                    as staff assistants to congresspeople.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Mansfield, for instance, was in Japan and he could stay along as he
                    wanted.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: That was off-limits. I wish some of the Foreign Servicofficers could

                <p>Q: There is real merit. There often is the problem of having never met a payroll.
                    It is a real problem. I know I suffered from this and I think most of us do.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I wish there was one little simple addition to telegrams,that the writer
                    of that telegram had his initials on it.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: The ambassador's name could be on it, but someplace alonthe line should
                    be who wrote it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I don't know why. You have no idea. In the paper on February 16, 1964,
                    or whatever, a person in the State Department with a name that he or she does
                    not want published, said, “I have had three or four conversations with him.” Who
                    was that? The janitor? How much of an authority is an individual of that kind?
                    That is another thing. How am I going to [navigate] that situation? “A State
                    Department official...” It also said “The despatch is a disaster.” That doesn't
                    mean anything.</p>
                <p>My other only comment is that I frankly enjoyed it, serving overseaand in the
                    Department. Seventeen years was enough.</p>

                    you're dealing with the nuclear issue or something like that, there isn't any
                    other issue out there.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: No. I like to fish- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is February 3, 2000. You said you had something you wanted to put on
                    tape and you weren't sure how you wanted to treat it. We thought we would do it
                    now and see how it goes.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: There are two items. Two situations arose that were delicate in the
                    sense of I was intrigued and I debated long and hard whether to even mention
                    this. I think I shall. A month or so before I left Iran, Governor John Connelly
                    (Governor of Texas, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, a major
                    figure in the Democratic and Republican parties) arrived with pomp and ceremony.
                    He let it be known that he wanted a conversation with His Imperial Majesty
                    without benefit of embassy accompaniment. He wanted to go by himself. That
                    smelled of something, palace intrigue of some magnitude. I just was not going to
                    have it and I told him so, that if he wanted a conversation with His Imperial
                    Majesty, I was going to accompany. He didn't like it a bit. We drove in virtual
                    silence up to the palace. He had a short conversation that amounted to
                    absolutely nothing. It dealt with the weather, the nicety of the country, and
                    how pleasant things were. He just happened to be there. We got in the car and
                    started down the hill and he said, “Would you mind closing that window between
                    us and the chauffeur. I want to speak to you in confidence. I want you to do the
                    following,” which I thought was very inappropriate. The suggestion was not to my
                    liking. Obviously, that was what he had in mind to talk to the Imperial Majesty
                    about. I mulled over this thing for some time. In due course, I wrote a double
                    talk, back channel communication to Kissinger conveying what had transpired and
                    asking for advice. In short order, I got a reply back: “Drop it,” which
                    confirmed my suspicion. I felt very good about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Governor Connelly's position at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: As far as I know, he didn't have any official position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the subject? You're making the money motion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>FARLAND: The way he phrased it, I don't know where it was going. In any event, it
                    was either for himself, for the political campaign, or to be divided up. I have
                    no idea. It was inappropriate and, as far as I'm concerned, illegal. So, that
                    passed over. The election was held. I was reappointed ambassador. I was getting
                    down to work and thought, “Now I can really go to work. I am strongly entrenched
                    here in the embassy and with the Shah.” The Shah was a good friend by now. He
                    trusted me. I mentioned during the first six months, “Look, Your Majesty, this
                    is not from the CIA. This is my personal observation. I think you're going to
                    have some major trouble with the mullahs.” He didn't answer. He sent word to me
                    subsequently that he was aware of that situation and he had it under control.
                    Well, obviously, he didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From where were you getting this information about the
                        mullahs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Personal observation and comments that I heard as an observer. I felt
                    that there was more going on than was being reported to him. I knew the CIA
                    hadn't reported it. How did I know these things? you go into a city and look at
                    the people's faces. You get a pretty good idea of what is going on. You look in
                    the shops and you get a pretty good idea of the economic situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of us, when we start looking at the Russian
                        Revolution anthe French Revolution, we see a court society which is living

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Too well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the problem. It doesn't seem to be well
                        integrated. Was this quite apparent at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was. The Shah was trying to minimize that, although hhimself overdid
                    it. That was a bad mistake.</p>

                <p>FARLAND: Whoever advised him on that began the Shah's downfall. It was a pathetic
                    situation. The Shahbanu was a lovely, lovely, solid person. The Shah was trying
                    to do the right thing. There were overtones of the past empire, yes. I was back
                    in 1978. He told me, “Joe, I don't know what to do. The embassy tells me one
                    thing. I do it. A special envoy comes from Washington, sent by the President,
                    and tells me something else diametrically opposed and I do that. Another envoy
                    comes from the United States military and tells me something else and I try to
                    do that. I've given the women the right to vote. I've given the right to hold
                    land. I've made them citizens of this country. I've taken land away from the
                    mullahs and given it to the poor of our country for farming. I've tried to do
                    what the United States has recommended, but the people are in the street walking
                    against me. The women are wearing the chador and parading against me. I don't
                    understand it.”</p>

                <p>FARLAND: And too fast. His family was a part of the difficulty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that the family was essentially very

                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: You can read in his book that the Shah criticized hevehemently as being
                    one of the thorns in his side.</p>
                <p>Q: I am talking about what you were getting from your embassy, your staff. Was
                    there the feeling that the Shah was a powerful person or essentially a rather
                    weak person who was trying to do what was best but really didn't have the
                    strength of personality to do it?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I didn't get that from the embassy or the CIA. Incidentally, there was a
                    CIA officer there who I consider one of the best I've bumped into. Another one
                    was a CIA officer in Pakistan who was absolutely tops. Some of those officers
                    were great and some of them weren't.</p>
                <p>Q: Who was top within the Political Section, your main people who knew Iran best,
                    studied the language, and were the best plugged into the situation?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: I had an excellent economic officer and a very goopolitical officer. I
                    think the economic officer was better.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I can't remember. The staff was adequate. It was a first-rate embassy as
                    far as I was concerned in many respects. But we were working under certain
                    hardships, too. Their contacts with the so-called opposition were most limited.
                    That is the way the situation was. I can't fault the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Off mike, you were saying you wanted to talk about
                        thappointment of Richard Helms as ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: I settled down thinking I could really go to work now and do what I felt
                    should be done. In about a month or six weeks, I received a telegram from the
                    Department saying that I was to go to the foreign office and ask for agrement
                    for Richard Helms. I was shocked. I was surprised. I had no previous warning. I
                    had no consultation on this. Nothing. So, I gathered up two or three other items
                    that I was going to talk about in the foreign office. Incidentally, in the other
                    tape, I was referring to the foreign minister. That should have been the prime
                    minister. Albayta was the man who turned out to be a good friend of mine. I went
                    down to the foreign office and went over a few of these things. At the end of
                    it, I said, “By the way, I will be leaving this post and I have been asked to
                    ask for agrement for Richard Helms, a very fine officer. He is now head of the
                    CIA. I am sure that he will follow in my footsteps and do an excellent job here
                    in Iran. I trust that you will extend agrement to him.” Then I started to walk
                    out. I got almost to the door and the foreign minister said, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    please come back. I didn't get the endpoint of what you said.” So, I repeated it
                    quietly and smilingly. He said, “Thank you very much.” That night, my wife and I
                    went to a cocktail party in one of the embassies and the prime minister,
                    Albayta, was there. He saw me. He walked over with his little cane in his hand,
                    banging it on the floor. He said, “I am mad! I am mad!” I said, “I'm not exactly
                    jumping with joy.” He said, “I am mad” and turned around and walked away. I was
                    getting ready to leave. I was sure that he asked for agrement. Not to do so
                    would be almost paramount to breaking relations. It would cause a problem.</p>
                <p>Q: It would cause a problem, but you can really say “I don't think this is
                    suitable.” I can't think of his name now, but the Iranians had a very strong
                    ambassador in Washington.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: His name was Zahedi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was very well connected.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>FARLAND: He was a watering spot in a social center the like of which hadn't been
                    seen since Demoyer from the Dominican Republic was there. There was a party
                    virtually every night. Wine and liquor flowed freely, along with caviar, which
                    was in abundance. Zahedi had been the general who had helped put the Shah's
                    father back on the throne. Anyway, about two or three nights before I was to
                    leave, my secretary got a call not from ALAN's (the court ministry) office,
                    which was the normal procedure, but apparently from someone close to the Shah.
                    It may have been his major domo, for all I know. He was asking that I alone come
                    up and see the Shah at 8:00 that night. Without benefit of bodyguards, I was not
                    worried. I drove up to the palace in which the Shah was resident and it was
                    dark. The lights weren't on. The entourage in front was not there. The place
                    looked empty. I wasn't exactly sure what I was getting into. This was most
                    unusual. I got out of that car and walked over to the door and the major domo,
                    who knew me, said, “Oh, Mr. Ambassador, come in.” I walked in. I thought they
                    hadn't paid the light bill. There were only just a few lights in the hall. He
                    said, “Just follow me, Sir. I will take you to His Imperial Majesty.” We walked
                    down, made a turn, made another turn, and he came to a door and said, “I am not
                    permitted to go into the room, Mr. Ambassador, so I will open the door and you
                    walk in and I will close it behind you.” Well, I've come this far. I might as
                    well go on. I walked in and over at the far end of the room sat the Shah in an
                    old sweatshirt, an old pair of pants. They looked like the dog had slept in him.
                    There were shoes that the dog obviously had been chewing. He said, “Come on in.”
                    I walked in and he said, “If you want a drink, you're going to have to help
                    yourself. My servants aren't allowed to see me dressed as I am now. That is to
                    say, undressed.” I said, “I had better have a drink under the circumstances,” so
                    I fixed a drink and went back. He said, “Sit down here beside me. I want to say
                    something.” There was a long pause. I took a sip of my drink and he said, “No
                    one likes to have something pushed down their throat. Royal throats are even
                    more tender than that of the plebeian. I have had something pushed down mine.
                    But I know how to get even and I am going to get even.” “Thank you very much. It
                    is awfully nice to see you. I am sorry I'm leaving.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it obvious he was referring to the
                        ambassadoriaappointment? This was unsaid, but known?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: You have been at this game a long time. You know what he was talking
                    about. I did, too. After some smalltalk, I went out the door. The major domo was
                    standing about 50 feet away. He met me. I did not report that conversation to
                    the State Department. I knew precisely what he was telling me. He was telling
                    me, “If you want to make some money out of this, you talk to some oil people. I
                    am raising the price of oil.” And it happened.</p>
                <p>Q: On the Helms thing, a personal shock is one thing, but his background going
                    there would have struck me as being almost gratuitous because it was widely
                    assumed that the CIA, run by Archie Roosevelt right after Mossedegh had [been
                    deposed] and put him back in.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: It was a fact.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So, putting a CIA man in sounded like we were putting
                        handler in as ambassador. It sent a very bad message.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: That is the way I thought about it. That is the way the prime minister,
                    Albayta, felt about it. That is obviously the way the Shah felt about it.</p>
                <p>Q: We look at the effect of what happened in Iran, but it sounds like this was
                    really more of a domestic deal that was put together to move Helms out of the
                    way.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Well, Helms' story of how it happened and Nixon's story as I've read and
                    other stories that I've read [differ]. “The Chinese Corridor” is one book that
                    has something about it. They are all slightly different. Helms says that Nixon
                    suggested it, that he hadn't thought about it. Regardless of that fact, Dick
                    went over. Unfortunately, during his confirmation, a friend of his wanted to ask
                    a gratuitous question which Helms answered negatively and the question was,
                    “Does the CIA have any activity in Chile?” Helms said, “No.” Well, Helms as a
                    result thereof was going back and forth to Washington almost on a monthly or
                    bi-weekly basis trying to get that straightened out. The CIA certainly did have
                    a big operation in Chile. I think Dick did a good job as far as he could, but he
                    didn't spend a lot of time there because he traveled a lot.</p>
                <p>Q: And the message was very bad. How about SAVAK, the police organization of the
                    Shah's government? What was your impression of how that ran?</p>
                <p>FARLAND: The CIA had a meeting with SAVAK constantly. I finally said that I
                    thought I should meet the head of SAVAK because of their relations with our CIA
                    and I did. From an outsider, they were rough. There is no question about that.
                    They were rough. This, remember, is the Middle East. Things were rough in
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things were rough in Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: Things were rough in Israel. I told Albayta... I went back into the
                    practice of law and was with a big law firm in Washington of Council. I
                    represented a big firm in Chicago on a dam they were building there. That is
                    what took me back in 1978 and that is when I last saw the Shah. The Shah was
                    aware that that the world was a little aghast at the way people in that part of
                    the world treated each other. He knew that this was a problem.</p>
                <p>Q: I've talked to people who went out as Iranian experts, who studied Farsi and
                    served in the consulates, etc. They said that there was always a major problem,
                    that it was almost impossible to make meaningful contact with the mullahs. It
                    wasn't a matter of our not wanting to, but you just couldn't.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>FARLAND: You couldn't. It was like trying to talk to the Popprivately, especially
                    the ones who sided fervently with Khomeini.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a problem with the court society absorbing an awful lot of your
                    embassy time? You've got the Bazaaris and the newly educated... A lot of
                    Iranians went to the United States and other places to get educated.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: There are right now 600-700,000 Iranians in the Los Angeles corridor
                    north to San Francisco. The Shah wanted the right for Iran Air to land in Los
                    Angeles because of all these people. The United States kept saying “No.” He
                    called me up one day and said, “Will you convey to the United States that Pan Am
                    will no longer stop in Teheran.” I got a telegram back: “Iran Air can stop at
                    Los Angeles.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes some of our most bitter negotiating points are
                        oveairline stops, airline franchises.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: It's true. Well, I don't know what to do with this.</p>
                <p>Q: I see no problem with it. Time has gone on. It's not the man's fault. The Shah
                    has passed from the scene. It doesn't reflect on Richard Helms.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: It doesn't reflect on him [except for] the sense that hdid get himself
                    into a jam.</p>
                <p>Q: That was a whole different matter. That is a matter of public record. Again,
                    it was quite apparent... You had this very peculiar relationship, I've found,
                    between Kissinger and Nixon. They treated Iran as almost a toy. We didn't use
                    common sense in our dealings with them as far as putting too many American
                    technicians in, which helped upset an awful lot of traditionalists. It was big
                    money and whatever the Shah wants, he can get.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: Plus oil.</p>
                <p>Q: And oil. The whole thing. So, it wasn't handled well. In hindsight, it's quite
                    obvious. But a lot of it came from what was set by Nixon and Kissinger and
                    carried on by Carter, really not trying to keep at some remove from the Shah and
                    trying to downplay American influence in the country.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: There was a great hatred over here towards Iran. I certainly sensed it
                    when I got back. But those are little bits and pieces that are a part of
                    the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm glad we'll put this in the record.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>FARLAND: I made some good friends. But again, it was impossible fome to get down
                    to the average household.</p>
                <p>Q: I think this is true of any ambassador. You go around and shake hands, but
                    when you get right down to it, you have to deal with either the ruling class or,
                    in some countries, the opposition. In a normal country, it's both. I have been
                    told that it started under Kissinger and Nixon that we were not to report much
                    (This may have come later.) on internal matters within Iran because the Shah
                    didn't want us to be messing around.</p>
                <p>FARLAND: No restrictions were laid on me, but-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this may have come a little later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FARLAND: As I said on the previous tape, I kept talking about the foreign
                    minister. That was the prime minister. His name was Hobayda. Jahanbani is now
                    married and living in France.</p>
