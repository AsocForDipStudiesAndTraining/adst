                <p>HENRY E. MATTOX</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: William N. Dale </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 22, 1993</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview between Henry E. Mattox and William
                        N. Dale, with the latter being the interviewer. Dr. Mattox is being
                        interviewed at Chapel Hill, North Carolina on April 22, 1993 with respect to
                        his Foreign Service career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I am William N. Dale, a retired Foreign Service officer living in Chapel Hill and
                    I have the pleasure and honor of interviewing Henry Mattox about his career.</p>
                <p>Henry I know that you're teaching now. I don't know how you looked at your
                    teaching in comparison to your former Foreign Service career. You must have some
                    thoughts about how the two work together giving you a broader intellectual
                    outlook, or something of that nature. I wonder if you could tell us how you look
                    at the two together?</p>
                <p>MATTOX: That's an interesting question in that, yes, the experience is important.
                    It gives you a leg up in teaching if you've been around for quite a long time.
                    And as you know, any Foreign Service officer has a certain amount of involvement
                    with teaching in the Foreign Service; teaching people under him, teaching local
                    employees, teaching and trying to educate one's bosses, and that sort of thing.
                    So you have a little bit of experience of that sort, but you have further, after
                    25 years or whatever in the Foreign Service, you have lived long enough to be
                    able to impart to the students not just the textbook knowledge, but you can
                    throw in little stories, and you can throw in experiences of your own,
                    especially if you're teaching American history as I am at North Carolina State
                    this semester. Especially if you're teaching American history of a fairly recent
                    date. I'm teaching at present a course called “Modern American History” which
                    starts with the end of the Civil War. None of us go back that far, but we do go
                    back much farther than any of these 20-year old kids. And it's helpful to be
                    able to say, “Oh, yes, I was in Vietnam at one time.” Or, “Oh, yes, I even
                    remember Watergate, for goodness sake.”</p>
                <p>Teaching is different from a Foreign Service career, but they do have
                    complementary aspects, I think. I certainly think I'm able to teach with some
                    greater breadth of vision for having served in the Foreign Service. Greater than
                    if I had never gone anywhere except into the classrooms for all these years
                    since I got out of school.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the idea before you went in the Foreign
                        Service that you might teach afterwards? Was the Foreign Service in some
                        sense a preparation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: No, not at all. It was not preparation at all, but I did have the idea
                    that once that phase of my professional life was over I would go to teaching at
                    the university level. In my case it would be a return to teaching because I
                    taught briefly at Ole Miss before starting out professionally. I taught, it so
                    happens, economics in those days. And I enjoyed it very much. But I realized
                    then that it would involve a great deal more life preparation, and a great deal
                    more academic preparation for me to be successful at that level. So I was
                    fortunate enough to go off and move from that phase into a Foreign Service
                    career, very fortunate to get into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry, I notice that you did go to Harvard for advanced
                        training when you had already been in the Foreign Service some time. I am
                        curious to know, in retrospect, how useful you found that in your subsequent
                        Foreign Service work, and how important it was in your assignments after you
                        had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: The training at Harvard exposed me to an area of learning that I had no
                    knowledge of whatever, that is to say, development economics. So it laid the
                    groundwork for a theoretical concepts and views, and approaches, that perhaps
                    were somewhat useful in my next post. I was chosen to go to this one year of
                    training at about the same time I was chosen to go off to Kathmandu. So the
                    assignment to Kathmandu was delayed some 12 months or more while this was being
                    carried out. The Foreign Service in its infinite wisdom had decided that a
                    trained economist was needed there. I had an MA in economics already but I
                    didn't have any exposure to development questions. Development questions clearly
                    would have been the focus of attention at a place like Nepal. So it helped in
                    that sense.</p>
                <p>In detail the training at Harvard did no good whatever because once you get to
                    the post, it's a question of reporting, it's a question of negotiating, it's a
                    question of common sense in dealing with your own AID people, in dealing with
                    the local government officials, and that sort of thing. You don't drag out these
                    high-blown theories of John Mason and such people when you're sitting down to
                    talk about things with your AID colleagues, or to talk about things with
                    development officials in the Third World country involved. It was useful as a
                    conceptual background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Kathmandu, I gather from what you've
                        said, we had an AID program of a kind.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MATTOX: A very large AID program. The AID program had been there longer than the
                    embassy. It was the senior service in other words. It had the largest compound,
                    the largest building, by far the largest budget, the largest staff, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it entirely of a developmental nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: Yes. We had nothing like the case in Latin American countries. The
                    Servicio approach in Latin America was funding for certain bureaus within the
                    local government—funding from American aid to directly support the activities of
                    a given governmental organization. We didn't do that in Nepal. We used Indian
                    rupees converted into Nepalese rupees from the surplus holdings in Delhi
                    essentially to buy import materials for development purposes for the Nepalese
                    government. The only dollar expenditures were those of the American technicians
                    who were assigned there. Yes, it was almost 100% development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that it was successful? That it made a lasting
                        difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: Despite the fact that I was there for four years, I can't really answer
                    that because it takes a much longer time. I know one program was very
                    unsuccessful. No, I won't say a disaster. The family planning was unsuccessful,
                    but it was unsuccessful in connection with the unsuccessful nature of the family
                    planning program in India, a much larger program.</p>
                <p>One program was successful, as far as I could tell, the Peace Corps. Not strictly
                    AID, of course. There were some AID educational programs indirectly related to
                    development that were, I think, fairly successful.</p>
                <p>Turning Nepal into a garden spot, and the industrial center of the Himalayas, no.
                    None of that happened. I have not been in touch in more recent years so I don't
                    know what's going on there. I suspect not a great deal. I suspect there's
                    nothing a great deal different from what it was when I was there 20 years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe you were there when Carol Laise was the
                        ambassadress. Did she take a great interest in the developmental work of the
                        AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MATTOX: Yes, she did. Incidentally, she went by the title Madam Ambassador. She
                    did not like ambassadress, and as you know, she was married to Ambassador Bunker
                    over in Vietnam. She took an interest in AID matters, but she did not involve
                    herself directly in those things because she was a former political officer. And
                    political officers almost by definition are not all that interested in economic
                    questions. She had me appointed....I was Second Secretary of Embassy and
                    Economic/Commercial officer. But she had me appointed as special assistant to
                    the AID director also, with an office over in the AID compound. So I had two
                    offices. I could hide in either one, it didn't matter.</p>
                <p>I was supposed to keep tabs on what the AID program was doing and keep her
                    informed, which I tried to do. It was relatively easy for me to do that because
                    I had very good working relations with the two AID directors who were there
                    during my long tenure. One was Jack Benz, and the other...unfortunately I hadn't
                    thought that I'd have to know his name, so therefore I can't think of it...oh,
                    Carter Ide. They were both very good officers. I lived next door to them, and I
                    had offices near theirs at the AID compound, so we got along famously.</p>
                <p>She was interested in such questions, but only in some broad sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose she spent a good deal of time traveling back and
                        forth to Vietnam at that period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: Well, not nearly as much as I'm sure she would have liked to have done
                    because Ambassador Bunker...a remarkable man, incidentally, really a remarkable
                    man...Ambassador Bunker would get over to visit in Kathmandu about once a month,
                    or once in six weeks. And then they would reverse the procedure the following
                    month, or the following six week period. The visiting back and forth was
                    justified as R&amp;R, which he needed of course, and the use of a military
                    flight was justified, I guess, on the basis that when the flight came over from
                    Vietnam, it would bring American Foreign Service people to spend a little
                    decompression time in Kathmandu. I went once with her and it was justified on
                    the basis that I was going on a study mission, which I did. Studying some of the
                    economic development programs that we were conducting in South Vietnam,
                    especially in the Delta region.</p>
                <p>She was fairly busy even though it was a quiet post. And God knows, he was
                    busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, he must have been, yes. You mentioned briefly in
                        passing your service in Latin America. I know that you have been in the
                        Azores. I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about what that post was
                        like, and what the United States' presence meant there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MATTOX: The Azores, out in the middle of the North Atlantic, was a small consular
                    post, overstaffed with three officers. At most there should have been two,
                    probably one. But it was a post that we had had open for a very long time,
                    initially because of the whaling industry. Whalers would go from the Azores to
                    New England and get themselves naturalized one way or another, and return to the
                    Azores and then their offspring would have sometimes rather obscure claims to
                    American citizenship—legitimate, but obscure. So we had these people going back
                    and forth, and then since World War II....In World War I we had a naval base. We
                    had destroyers and such based in the Azores. World War II the same thing plus
                    the RAF and the United States took over a Portuguese air base at some stage. I
                    don't remember the timing exactly. So we had servicemen in the Azores from World
                    War II, or shortly thereafter, right up until the time that I was there, and
                    even today in 1993, I guess, at Lajes. So we had a consulate, at least an
                    honorary consul, there for decades and decades, since 1795, I think.</p>
                <p>When I was there we had a very able consul, named Roger Heacock, and two vice
                    consuls, one of whom I was. Very quiet, not terribly demanding usually. We used
                    a one-time pad, if you remember them, for sending and receiving coded stuff. It
                    was so complicated, and so difficult, we never sent anything coded during the
                    two years that I was there.</p>
                <p>We issued visas to Azoreans going to the U.S. We turned down far more visas than
                    we issued. We registered the births, and issued passports to American citizens
                    90 miles away at the Lajes Air Force Base. It was very quiet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interested that you turned down a lot of visas from
                        there. What kind of reasons were there for turning them down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: Well, one, basically they had no intention of really ever returning. They
                    were unable to overcome the presumption that they were going to the United
                    States to work, and to stay some indefinite period of time. To a large extent
                    they were unable to overcome the assumption that they were not tourists. So we
                    were obliged under law, the McCarran Act of 1952, to turn such people down. And
                    if you chickened out, and didn't turn them down, sooner or later the Department
                    was going to get you and slap you on the wrist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose that would have been good training for your next
                        post at Sao Paulo. And when you were in Sao Paulo, I'm interested in knowing
                        how much support we gave to the democratic regime. I think it was a
                        democracy during the time you were there, and it was before, I think, a
                        number of military regimes. I wonder if you could comment a little bit on
                        how, if at all, we supported that, or played a role there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MATTOX: I'm afraid I can't comment on that because I was the visa officer, the
                    only visa officer, at a consulate general, Sao Paulo, and I was fairly far
                    removed from the embassy. And we had such a visa workload—I was both NIV, and IV
                    officer. I had a fairly large staff but nobody else who could sign. So I was
                    just swamped every day. When I first went there, Juscelino Kubitschek was
                    president. He soon left office peacefully, and the newly elected president,
                    Janio Quadros came to office. That was a fascinating episode because Quadros was
                    quite weirdly honest, a rather strange man. He kept threatening to
                    resign—threatening to the military who were not technically in control. He was
                    going to resign if such and such wasn't done. After about nine months, I can't
                    remember whether he was in Brasilia or Rio, he threatened to resign, and the
                    military said, OK, and bundled him up, put him in a plane, flew him down to
                    Santos, installed him in his summer cottage, or something of that sort, and
                    guarded him. So the vice president, with a great deal of controversy, took
                    office. This was the next to last gasp before the military eventually did take
                    over. The military, I don't think, took over until I was back in INR in the
                    Department. I had left Brazil.</p>
                <p>Later on I had a couple of friends who were junior officers in the political
                    section in Rio, but I had no direct experience. What kind of support, what kind
                    of contacts we had, I don't even know whether the people in Rio were in frequent
                    contact with Quadros, or what. I do know that he was viewed as really a rather
                    odd person because of his unaccountable honesty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a very interesting point, and very well phrased.
                        When you got back to the State Department you were in INR, I believe. Was
                        your field of activities in connection with Latin America at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: It was all Latin America. We had a rather large crew on board in INR in
                    those days even though the biographic function had been hived off and sent
                    across the river to the Agency. We had Civil Service and Foreign Service
                    analysts dealing with functional questions by region, and dealing with country
                    desk officers within the intelligence context. When I arrived from Brazil, they
                    said, “Hah, you're in from Latin America so therefore you are from now on INR's
                    expert on Latin American communism, Latin American student movements, Bolivia,
                    and Peru,” neither of which country I had ever been to. So I read into the job,
                    and over close to three years I got to where I was fairly conversant with those
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>INR at that time also, somewhat unusually, sent me to Latin America on two or
                    three study tours—down through the Canal, and then down to Lima, and then up
                    into the mountains, all by myself riding on buses and that sort of thing, into
                    La Paz. That was a lot of fun and I learned a good bit about the countries
                    involved. I was just about earning my pay when it came about time to be
                    transferred, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that's all too often the case. You spoke about
                        both Foreign Service and Civil Service people operating in INR at that time.
                        How did they work together? I should imagine the Civil Service might have
                        had a longer period of time in one field, and I'm not quite sure how that
                        would work out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: On the analyst level, the Civil Service people usually were young Ph.D.s
                    who were getting a start, and who were aiming for academic careers. This was a
                    good stopping off place. They would have research and writing responsibilities
                    that would be interesting and that would look good on the CVs later on. And then
                    they would go off to some teaching post in academia. At the upper, shall we say
                    mid-management level, we had people who had been around donkey's years, who were
                    deputy office directors. Some of them had been with the Department for a very
                    long time. Some had transferred over from the Agency when there was a splitting
                    up of certain functions. All of them that I can think of, were very able. They
                    simply did not have the perspective that even a young FSO would have. I'm not
                    saying that's necessarily bad, but they looked at things a little bit
                    differently than the young FSO. And they were much more knowledgeable about
                    in-fighting, the bureaucratic game in Washington, than any FSOs who came in from
                    the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's how they were different. That's one of the ways
                        they were different. Were there other ways that they had a different
                        outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: They tended to be more theoretical or academic in their approach, I
                    think, than even the young FSO who had been out in the field and had seen that
                    things are not quite as neat and orderly as you might analyze them to be if you
                    had been sitting in Washington all those years. That's a convoluted way of
                    saying, I think it would have been helpful if we'd had Civil Servants who had
                    more experience abroad, and FSOs who had more experience back in Washington. Now
                    this latter point may have been resolved in more recent years because, as I
                    understand it, FSOs spend a great deal of time back in Washington nowadays, the
                    last 20 years or so. I never did. I spent almost all of my time abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's very interesting. After being in Kathmandu,
                        you went on to Port-au-Prince, I believe. I was wondering when you were
                        there, Jean-Claude Duvalier was the ruler, president at that time I gather.
                        How did the United States government react to the way that his succession
                        was handled? Or what did you hear about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MATTOX: I was there when the old man died, and Jean-Claude, Baby Doc, as he was
                    called abroad but not in that country, of course, took over with the backing of
                    his mother and of the military at the time. Otherwise he would not have been
                    able to do anything. Papa Doc Duvalier, while I was there from '70 to '73, I
                    guess it was—Papa Doc ruled in a benign fashion because all of his opposition
                    had been killed off. So life was rather pleasant, and rather unruffled. There
                    were no roundups, there were no public executions as had been the practice for
                    quite some time. People would disappear but no American citizens were involved
                    so we were not directly involved. When he died, rather unexpectedly—well, he was
                    sick for a day or two, or a week or something like that, and he designated
                    Jean-Claude as his successor. We all thought this could not actually be
                    happening: The boy is 19 years old. The old man is out of his mind, or either
                    this has been faked, or something or other. So Jean-Claude came to power. The
                    old man died. I went through the enormous crowds there at the palace to view the
                    remains lying in state. I wanted to do this, facetiously I should say, I wanted
                    to do this to make sure he was dead. And he was, Jean-Claude took over with the
                    embassy predicting seriously that he would not last more than six months. He
                    turned out to be a lot more astute than we thought, even so young. And he was
                    utterly ruthless too; well, at least he gave that appearance because at public
                    events often he carried a great big automatic pistol in his hand, hanging down
                    by the side of his trousers. He turned out to have a lot of his father's genes.
                    He isolated his mother. He didn't ever exile her or anything, but he isolated
                    her completely. He had some of the military people who might have been rivals
                    exiled, sent off to Miami which was sort of the Devil's Island for Haitians in
                    those days, unless they were exiles with a lot of money. And he lasted, as we
                    all know, for a very long time.</p>
                <p>Nothing changed for the majority of Haitians, and nothing could really be
                    expected to change. Jean-Claude turned out to be just as astute as his father,
                    and maybe even more so, in stripping the treasury, and building up his Swiss
                    bank accounts.</p>
                <p>I met him several times, but he never said a word. He appeared to be really quite
                    dumb, but he wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps his sign of intelligence was to keep still
                        sometimes. Was it apparent then that Haiti would become the economic basket
                        case it is now? Or were things rather better managed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: No, things were very bad then, though they may perhaps have gotten
                    marginally worse since then. We had a very small aid program at that time
                    because Papa Doc Duvalier was in disfavor. It was administered by me and the
                    economic section until about—I'd been there about a year and a half—until AID
                    sent out an AID officer, and we worked jointly. He became a very close friend
                    with whom I still correspond. But it was only about total $3 million a year,
                    something like that, or less, I can't remember.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The place was a basket case then. One of the best programs designed to alleviate
                    problems and suffering were those administered by the relief agencies, the
                    voluntary relief agencies like Catholic Relief. These were funded directly by
                    the AID program which thereby indirectly funded certain activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is beyond the $3 million?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: No, included. It permitted the U.S. government on a very limited scale to
                    fund certain things such as rural health, not developmental projects. There were
                    no road improvements going on at that time. The IBRD would not touch the place.
                    We marveled, as I started to say earlier, at the way that 150 years previously
                    Haiti had been one of the wealthiest countries in the world with its sugar
                    production and its shipping. In fact it was a shipping stop off point. One of
                    the busiest ports in the world around 1800, other than I guess London, was a
                    place called M�le St. Nicolas up in the northwest corner of the country. By the
                    time I was there, the country was importing sugar. It was on our sugar quota and
                    we were pushing sugar on them, selling sugar. The country produced some of the
                    finest coffee in the world, but not enough really for any significant export
                    earning. It was a basket case. It's a worse basket case now perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe you went on to London from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: London was very enjoyable. I went there as one of the commercial
                    officers. We had an office setup in London, a rather large commercial section,
                    with FSOs named to handle certain industrial areas. I happened to have
                    high-tech, I don't know why exactly, all of the computer industries, and the
                    computer products, and the nuclear energy, and aviation, and things like that.
                    That was fun. It was not terribly significant. The ambassador during part of the
                    time I was there was Walter Annenberg. And toward the end of my tour of two
                    years, Elliot Richardson came in as ambassador.</p>
                <p>Therein lay a tale. Apparently at that time I looked like the long-lost twin
                    brother of Elliot Richardson. I'm not sure that we even look anything alike now
                    at all, but at that time apparently so. I had Marines constantly saluting me. It
                    took me quite a while to figure out what it was all about. Out there in
                    Grosvenor Square when I would come back from lunch, I had herds of tourists
                    pointing at me and whispering. It took me a while to figure out what that was.
                    Eventually the Marines got used to the fact that I was not Richardson.</p>
                <p>All I did—we pushed exports. We didn't push investment, of course, but exports.
                    The last year that I was there—and this may be coincidental, I don't know—in
                    1975 was the last year that the United States had an export surplus on
                    merchandise account.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure its a tribute to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: I'd say it might be coincidental.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the impression at that time that England was
                        making real progress in its technological industries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: I had the impression then that the English were very good, as we've known
                    for a long time, at innovation but rather poor at implementation of their
                    technology. We had a long controversy, an almost polite kind of battle over the
                    technology that would be used in England's future nuclear energy program. It was
                    a U.S. versus a British technology. A U.S. development versus a British
                    development. One was called something or other...I shouldn't have said that
                    because I can't remember the names of the technology now. But we did our best in
                    the embassy to get the British to adopt, at a lesser cost, the American
                    technology through Westinghouse and GE, and people of that sort. We were really
                    pushing, and the Senate would have been proud...Senator what's his name, from
                    Delaware would have been pleased if he had known how hard we were pushing.</p>
                <p>But at the last moment it was, of course, as you might have predicted, a
                    political decision, and the British adopted the British technology. Eventually
                    it cost them a great deal more money and I'm not sure how successful it was. But
                    there you are. It just reminded me of the British development of the jet
                    aviation, the plane, the DeHavilland, that flew first across the Atlantic and
                    then disappeared from sight, and never was developed. The U.S. developed the
                    technology for jet airliners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry, when you were there, and you had Ambassador
                        Annenberg, did he know the names of officers in the embassy, say at your
                        level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: Oh, no, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate in that sense? With a few top officers?
                        Or by himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MATTOX: Well, he ran through four DCMs, I understand. I should have looked up
                    some of these names because I'm very bad at remembering names. To the extent
                    that he dealt with anybody, at any level, it was through his DCM. He had staff
                    meetings about once every two months at which he presided, with the DCM there,
                    and a fairly large group of officers. Everyone looked forward to it because
                    people wondered exactly what he was going to say, what kind of verbal gaffs he
                    might make. Now I know it is not very nice to say these things. But it was just
                    an embarrassment sometimes to listen to him.</p>
                <p>One of the strange things was that movie that he had made of his presentation to
                    Queen Elizabeth at which he made all kinds of strange remarks, and became so
                    tongue-tied, and so embarrassed, that he talked like a jabbering idiot almost.
                    The strange thing was he was very proud of that film, and he showed it to
                    audiences of embassy people every once in a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously he had different standards from you. Do you
                        consider him to have been what you might call a working ambassador, who took
                        an interest in the work of the embassy. Or was he there chiefly for the
                        social prestige, and the social events.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: He was there chiefly for the prestige. He did accomplish a couple of good
                    things. He made a lot of friends eventually for the embassy, and for the United
                    States, by contributing rather heavily, I think, to certain British charities.
                    And he did contribute a great deal to the upkeep of Winfield House and
                    renovations of certain aspects of Winfield House. It had gotten rather run down
                    sitting there in Regents Park. But when he left and Richardson came,
                    unfortunately he took his art collection with him. So when Richardson, before I
                    left, would give some big reception, it was painfully obvious that there had
                    been paintings hanging on the walls here and there and everywhere, but there
                    were just sort of blank, slightly faded spots around and about.</p>
                <p>He did help, though, in the sense of, if you consider this really important, he
                    did help in the sense of putting a lot of money into Winfield House in
                    renovations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you. Your next assignment of course was Cairo
                        where you were there for four very important years, from '75 through '79
                        when Sadat was the Egyptian leader. I wonder if you could tell us a little
                        bit about how you found Sadat from the point of view of his working
                        techniques.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MATTOX: The working techniques that I witnessed were how he played on CODELs. He
                    could play them like a banjo. He had a set piece...let me back up a little bit.
                    We had a great deal of Congressional interest in what was going on in Egypt,
                    unsurprisingly. So we had, therefore, CODELs coming in and out all the time.
                    Fortunately by the time they started coming in in such numbers the staff of the
                    embassy had been expanded a good bit. When I first went there in '75 there were
                    only about seven people, and I was sort of the first of the added bodies that
                    were being thrown into the place. The AID mission built up as well shortly
                    thereafter, too.</p>
                <p>But we had by the time I left, the last couple of years that I was there, we had
                    an average of a Congressional visitor per day throughout the year. We had about
                    360 or 370 CODELs per year. So he would see every one of them. He was no dummy
                    by far. He wouldn't say, “Oh, that's some obscure Congressman. I don't care to
                    see him.” He would see every one of them. Either I would take them, or the
                    ambassador would take them, or the political counselor would take them, or
                    somebody. Usually the political counselor or I, maybe one or two other officers,
                    would do most of the trotting around with the Congressional delegations because
                    Ambassador Eilts didn't want just anybody and everybody taking these people
                    around. There was too much at stake.</p>
                <p>We would go to call on Sadat, and he would be utterly affable, utterly
                    forthcoming, utterly outgoing, and informative, sincere, articulate, and
                    charming. Even the most initially unbelieving Congressman would come out
                    convinced that Sadat was a great man, and the affairs of the country were in
                    good hands. He was utterly convincing. He almost always said the same thing, but
                    it sounded fresh and new and nobody would know that unless he'd sat in on these
                    things before.</p>
                <p>Occasionally he would change some nuance, or change some direction, or change
                    some emphasis, at which time I would find it interesting enough to go back and
                    dictate a telegram to the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give us an example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: No, I can't think of anything off hand. It would have something to do
                    with let's say his intentions with regard to his next contacts with Israel, or
                    something of that sort. Or it might have been something like a seeming change in
                    emphasis in developmental questions. Nothing really terribly consequential, but
                    enough different from the last time to catch my attention. He never looked at
                    his watch or anything, but these briefings of the Congressmen, and the members
                    of the U.S. Cabinet who came out, such as Secretary Blumenthal. He would run
                    these briefings exactly one hour, and that was that. He would invest an hour in
                    the Congressman, or the group of Congressmen, or the Secretary of the Treasury,
                    whatever, and he would give them precisely an hour and no more. With great
                    affability he would then usher them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It might be that he earned several million dollars an hour
                        at that rate. I notice you were there when Secretary of State Vance visited,
                        of course, Cairo. Do you have any reflections on Secretary Vance and his
                        operating methods?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: I didn't have any great exposure to him in any detail but I did sit in on
                    some meetings with him, and I did go to a formal dinner where there were about
                    15 or 20 people invited. He made the kind of impression that was strong enough
                    for me to remember it still. I guess I always will remember it. He didn't
                    actually say anything, or do anything, but he emanated a sense of authority and
                    integrity that just stayed with you. He was a man like Bunker, I think. Almost
                    didn't have to say anything, almost didn't have to do anything. But he carried
                    with him a mantle of authority. He carried with him a mantle of impeccable
                    integrity. Richardson would be another person of that sort. And there's no way
                    to imitate it. There's no way to borrow from it. There's no way to fake it. I
                    think it was a loss to the administration when he did resign.</p>
                <p>That brings us to Jimmy Carter who did not have that same mantle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: He did not as far as I can see. We have to say one thing though,
                    regardless of whatever failures Jimmy Carter had in his projects, and his
                    proposals, and his programs, etc., as long as there's a history of U.S.
                    involvement in the Middle East it will have to show that he was eminently
                    successful in that particular initiative, Camp David. Camp David was his baby,
                    he worked very hard for it. He worked appropriately too. He knew what he was
                    doing, he was a quick study. This is one instance when getting down to the level
                    of detail that he was prone to do, worked. Everybody knows that he tended to
                    deal too much in detail, but it was necessary in this case. I would see him
                    shuttling back and forth between Tel Aviv and Cairo at the airport, and then
                    back to Tel Aviv, back to Cairo and something would come up and he'd get on the
                    phone and he'd talk to Menachem [Begin], and he'd straighten it out. It might
                    take him 30 minutes on the phone, but he'd get it straightened out. All these
                    people sitting around in the conference room waiting until he got that
                    straightened out, and then he would straighten it out with Menachem, and then he
                    would straighten it out with Anwar, and Anwar would go back to Menachem. There
                    wouldn't have been a Camp David if it hadn't been for him. And the results of
                    Camp David are still with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. Henry, the embassy must have been a pretty
                        exciting place during the time you were there. Can you say a little about
                        what the general atmosphere was in the embassy, and about Ambassador
                        Eilts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MATTOX: It was an interesting time, it was a very active time, and everyone
                    worked their tails off partly because of the nature of the issues that the
                    embassy was facing. But largely because of the example set by Hermann Eilts.
                    Eilts is clearly an example of a workaholic in the Foreign Service. He spoke
                    Arabic. He had been 30 years in the Middle East at that time. He knew Sadat
                    well. He had a direct line between his office and Sadat's office. He didn't use
                    it, but Sadat did to call him. He worked day and night, twelve hours a day,
                    seven days a week. So there was sort of a sense of great urgency all the time.
                    There was a sense of great accomplishment as well all the time, especially after
                    the Sadat initiative to Jerusalem. And there was a sense as well that we had,
                    not we necessarily, but we had presided over the defeat of the Soviets in the
                    Middle East. They were still there in large numbers but they had no influence.
                    They didn't do anything except whatever dam projects they were involved in, that
                    sort of thing. It was good to be on the winning side like UNC in the NCAA
                    tournament this year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Henry, I think except for one question I have. Way
                        back in your career when you were in Paris. I think that concludes the
                        questions which I was thinking about. Back when you were in Paris, which I
                        guess was your first post really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there at a time which was a forced retrenchment
                        really in France's imperial holdings. Did the French that you came in
                        contact with, and I realize that at that time you were a Third Secretary,
                        seem to blame the United States appreciably for their forced withdrawals,
                        Vietnam, Morocco, Tunisia, and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: When I was there they really hadn't withdrawn from Algeria yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I didn't mention Algeria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: No, I know, so they still had an empire. They still had one little
                    remnant anyway. I don't remember any agitation against the United States. There
                    used to be a riot a week. It would come right down the Champs-Elys�es, and go
                    right by the embassy but nobody ever did anything to the American embassy. They
                    would go riot over against the Chamber of Deputies. French society was split
                    right down the middle over the question of Algeria, in the general sense that
                    you posed, of empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>As we know, eventually the man who came to power, De Gaulle, on a promise of
                    retaining the empire actually turned right around and shed the nation, to its
                    vast relief, of the empire. I guess I would have to say the number of riots that
                    I saw there, none of which were directed against America, or the American
                    embassy, all of that would indicate that there was no perceptible resentment of
                    the United States in response to the question you have just raised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this is very interesting. Sometimes, I think, we
                        presume there's a resentment against the United States when it really
                        doesn't exist as much as you think it does. You ended as a Foreign Service
                        examiner. I don't have any particular questions on that. Do you have any
                        comments on that final phase of your career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTOX: In personal terms it marked the completion of a cycle because one takes
                    the exam and goes before these people and then I had the unusual opportunity 24
                    years later of being on the other side of the counter. It was fascinating, and a
                    very difficult job to try to screen out who would make the best Foreign Service
                    officer. Difficult, but really very interesting. It made me wonder how on earth
                    I ever got in in the first place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much. I think that concludes the
                        interview.</hi>
