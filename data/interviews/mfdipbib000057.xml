                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 7, 1999. This is an interview with
                        Chester E. Beaman. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What should I call you?</p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Chet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're “Chet” and I'm “Stu.” All right, Chet. When and
                        wherwere you born? Tell me something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I was born in Kokomo, Indiana on January 16, 1916, said to have been the
                    coldest night of the year. My father was a factory machinist and my mother
                    before she was married worked as a maid. Her father was a carpenter. He had a
                    large family of eight children; on my father's side, there were four children,
                    but two of them died before I ever came on the scene. Grandpa Beaman was also a
                    factory worker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was family life like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I did not regard ourselves as poor, but, nevertheless, it was a factory
                    district middle class existence which like others was hard hit by the
                    Depression. When I was growing up, at first we had just basic furniture and
                    rugs. However, we did not have an inside toilet, a bathtub, telephone, or
                    anything now considered proper living until I was in high school or college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A machinist was somewhat of a specialty.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. My father went into the factories early. He worked himself up until
                    he was a skilled machinist. Even during the Depression, when a lot of people
                    were laid off and he was too, he would be called back periodically for maybe
                    three or four days or maybe a couple of weeks because he did have this skill.
                    The other thing about him was that he was an avid baseball player. In those days
                    in Kokomo and elsewhere, they had what they called “industrial leagues.”
                    “Industrial” is an odd name because it could be a church, a clothing store, as
                    well as factories that had baseball teams. They would play a summer season in
                    Kokomo. My father was considered a star player. So I grew up in the current
                    baseball environment, but I never was as good at baseball as my father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What position did your father play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Third base or left field. He was also a boxer and a basketball player in
                    his youth, but his “love” was baseball. He was a man about six feet two inches.
                    I never reached that height.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to reach. At home, were ideas discussed much? How
                        diyou spend your time at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Of course, in the early years, like all of the children, I played with
                    the few toys available. I primarily had trains. I loved trains and still do. We
                    did not have many shelf books - a book and a large picture book on World War I,
                    and a book entitled “Sermons of the Devil.” There were family discussions, not
                    so much ideas per se, but facts and events - politics, sports, factory work,
                    local scandals, and costs of various items. Actually, I became somewhat
                    “bookish” even at about age seven, when I could get a library card and walk a
                    mile downtown to the library. There I could read various books and references in
                    the children's department and bring books home. The first book I ever brought
                    home was “The Life of George Washington.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the Carnegie Library?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much discussion in the house about things you
                        woulread?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. I'm sorry to say that my mother had to quit school in the sixth grade
                    to work to help support her family. My father left high school in his sophomore
                    year because he played hooky and the principal expelled him. What I learned from
                    them were practical things of living. Idea material? No. That is what I got from
                    the library. Then later when the radio came along, listening to Lowell Thomas,
                    and general programs. One of my favorite radio programs was listening to “The
                    Little Theater Off Times Square.” Over the radio it presented various plays,
                    operettas, and musicals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like the Lux Radio Theater.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. So, my intellectual stimulation didn't come directly from
                    my family, but what I did learn from them were practical things, for which I am
                    grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I started at an elementary school which was three blocks from my house. I
                    later went to a high school which was about a mile downtown. Then I eventually
                    went to DePauw University, where I got a scholarship. The first year, I had to
                    make at least a B average to get it extended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to elementary school. What was the school
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Certainly not like today's schools. We had classes of 20-30 pupils. They
                    had half grades: 1A was the first semester and 1B was the second semester. Then
                    there were 2A and 2B. It was in a school that my mother had gone to. It was that
                    old. It was a brick school, the usual thing, with sort of a tower at the front
                    that you see in pictures. My sister and I went there for seven years. We learned
                    under individual teachers for each grade. There were school activities like
                    Arbor Day athletic exercises. Little plays would be put on in each class,
                    usually on a “parents night.” There was also a basketball team which played
                    other schools. As far as grades were concerned, I made good grades from the
                    beginning. Teachers used to say, “Oh, you could be President.” I would think, “I
                    don't want to be President.” One thing about schools in those days, the teachers
                    maintained discipline, not excessive, but they would not permit any nonsense.
                    “Bully boys” were kept in line. No one ever brought a gun to school. We had
                    groups of friends but not “gangs.” I am appalled at what is happening in some
                    schools today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Kokomo like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: In those days, Kokomo was basically an industrial town and it still is.
                    It claims that the first commercially successful automobile, the Haynes,
                    performed there on July 4, 1896. Later I learned that the Germans and French had
                    also developed automobile models about the same time. Kokomo became an
                    industrial center because of the invention of the automobile, Haynes and
                    Apperson, and because of natural gas discovered along Wildcat River. The gas
                    provided the fuel for the factories. A lot of different factories were there for
                    years but some have now been replaced by other factories. But the city grew. I
                    don't know what its population is now, but at one point in my high school years,
                    it was about 30,000. Then the city spread out, like a lot of communities, into
                    the countryside. Most of our entertainment, if you want to call it that, was on
                    a Saturday night. Mother worked at home and my father worked at the factory.
                    Saturday was the day we all went downtown together, first by streetcar and then
                    later by a Ford we acquired at some point along the line. Many other people came
                    to the town center. There were no malls in those days. We just went from store
                    to store. Some people, especially the Amish, came by horses and buggies and
                    parked them around the Courthouse. Otherwise on Saturday night, we often took in
                    a movie and then did shopping or got refreshments at drugstores. When I got to
                    high school, I, of course, went downtown by myself - usually to take a girl or
                    go with friends to a movie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the drugstore, didn't you, for soda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. Most of the time for a cold drink or some ice cream. I had terrific
                    headaches in those days. Sometimes my father took me to a drugstore for a dose
                    of Kapedine, which was supposed to knock out a headache. Anyway, my headaches
                    eventually tapered off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the ethnic makeup of Kokomo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I guess I would basically say it was an Anglo-Saxon Protestant town,
                    although there was a substantial Catholic, usually Irish, population. In our
                    part of town there was a mix of Protestants and Catholics. There was a small
                    Jewish population, but most of them lived elsewhere in town. In addition to the
                    Irish, there was a sprinkling of Germans, Poles, and Greeks. About three miles
                    from us was an area called “the Negro District” where most of the blacks lived.
                    It was not that they were officially segregated. But the elementary school,
                    “Douglas,” set aside for black children, was in that district. Naturally black
                    parents wanted to be where their children had to go to school. Unfortunately, if
                    Negroes wanted to go to a movie, which were all in the center of town, they had
                    to sit in the balcony or at the back of the theater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the school system, were things pretty much divided? Was
                        there a Catholic school system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. As I have indicated, the black children went to one specified
                    elementary school. The Catholics, on their part, segregated their own children
                    at elementary level. Their church (looking like a medieval cathedral) was near
                    us, as were also the Catholic school and the nuns' (teachers') home. In both
                    these cases, the Negro and Catholic children came together with the rest of us
                    at high school level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that divide the children up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, I don't think so. I played with Catholics. I didn't even ask whether
                    they were Catholics. We just played. The interesting thing, however, was that
                    when we got to high school, black students were among us, but they tended at
                    lunch hour and between classes to keep to themselves. So, I guess I had a black
                    friend or two, but not really close. I don't think there was a definite
                    structuring of society there based on religion, but there is no question that
                    the Catholics had their church, they had their school, and they had their own
                    beliefs. The blacks, on the other hand, because of the situation in the country
                    in those days, had their own part of town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to high school, which would have been
                        abou1928 or so...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. It was 1930.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1930. Did one major or specialize in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, they had three sets of courses. I took what was called the “general
                    course” because I didn't know what I was going to be doing in life.
                    Consequently, I took a course that had history, English, algebra, and French. At
                    the same time, part of it was machine shop, printing, automobile mechanics,
                    woodworking, and drafting. But they had another course that was strictly
                    academic. That was primarily for high school students who thought they were
                    going to go to college. Instead of the craft-type of classes, it had other
                    classes. Also, there was a business course which could be pursued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in high school, did any of the teachers
                        inspire you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Definitely: my French teacher. I was editor of the French newspaper and I
                    made As in French. She called me in one day and had a talk with me about my
                    language - not swear words, but just my “ain't” and other word usage. She said
                    that I should correct these faults because she felt that I was moving on, but I
                    had better start preparing myself. So, she was an inspiration. Then there was a
                    chemistry professor who had gone to DePauw University. He encouraged me to apply
                    for a scholarship to DePauw University. Actually, I was in competition with a
                    friend of mine who said, “Well, you make good grades. You ought to apply for
                    this scholarship.” He lost out and I won. I felt bad about his not getting a
                    scholarship. I'd say those two, at least - Mr. McCarthy and Miss Thornberg - but
                    my teachers all did, in a way, urge me to succeed.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: By that time, largely historical material from the library. There wasn't
                    anything like today where you can go buy a book at Crown Books and read it. One
                    went to the library and borrowed books. Our family never really had any
                    intellectual-type material. There were a few books, as I have previously noted.
                    In the library, there was a series of books on the Civil War. They were novels
                    and were in the children's section.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. I enjoyed them. I also read all 30 Books of Knowledge over a period
                    of time. I read some of Sir Walter Scott's books - Ivanhoe and The White
                    Company. I recall two other books I enjoyed - Not Peace but a Sword about the
                    uncertainty and turmoil in Europe, and Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. I did not
                    eat meat for several days after I finished that one. I did read narrative novels
                    as well as straight history. There was no question history was my greatest

                    served in World War I, so he was very good at explaining political and economic
                    problems. As the Depression deepened there was discussion of its attributes.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: I perceived it as being quite a blow. Not only was my father laid off
                    work. There were family discussions about how to cut expenses; we ate the
                    cheapest food. I personally wondered what the future would bring.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Depression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. The Depression is one of the events that is imprinted on my mind and
                    really shaped part of my career. Many people were unemployed. There were men who
                    obviously had worked in offices, selling apples at five cents on streetcorners
                    downtown. There were soup lines of people who didn't get enough food. They would
                    go to the fire engine station and get a meal at noon. Many banks closed, losing
                    a lot of people's savings. Many mortgages were foreclosed on farms and homes. It
                    was a low point in our American history. That explains why a lot of working
                    class people admired Roosevelt. When he came in, I don't know if he knew how
                    things were going to turn out with his various programs, but he did something.
                    Many New Deal programs were intended to put people to work. Agencies like PWA,
                    WPA, and CCC put unemployed persons to work until industry and business could
                    reabsorb them. When I was in college, I was the recipient of NYA (National Youth
                    Administration) work for college students. I got so much an hour for first
                    manual work, then research work. This was a great help to me personally. Kokomo,
                    being an industrial town, the majority of the citizens suffered during the
                    Depression. The New Deal programs at least raised their hopes for the
                    future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the newspaper in Kokomo? What did you as a
                        young higschool student read to keep up with what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: First of all, originally, when I was younger, there were two papers: “The
                    Kokomo Dispatch” and “The Kokomo Tribune.” “The Kokomo Dispatch” was a
                    democratic paper. My father took “The Tribune” because it was an evening paper.
                    Later, I became a carrier for “The Kokomo Tribune.” I read all sorts of things
                    on politics, economics, history, and I also scraped up enough money to subscribe
                    to “The Literary Digest,” which I later learned was a conservative
                    publication.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the magazine which predicted the election of Alf
                        Landon in 1936.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. It folded after that for predicting wrong. Nevertheless, it provided
                    good summaries of world events. Also, my father was a member of the Eagles. He
                    and my mother would go to dances on Saturday nights. I would sit down in the
                    reading room. It had a lot of magazines and newspapers. I read those. This was
                    the type of reading that I got over and beyond what I would have gotten at
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you all sit around and listen to the radio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Oh, yes. In the late 1920s, the radio had something for all. I always
                    listened to Lowell Thomas. He came on every day, and I listened to him avidly.
                    He had traveled the world and, during his evening news program, would often
                    describe Lhasa in Tibet (I've been wanting to get there all my life; I only got
                    to Nepal). Thomas also spoke of Africa and Europe. My father, of course, liked
                    the sports programs; my mother the comics and barn dances. When the radio
                    carried the conventions for the 1928 election, I spent hours listening to the
                    proceedings. I was age 12 � years old at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Al Smith versus Hoover.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: And Hoover won. I also stayed up nights in 1932 listening to the
                    conventions. Both were held in Chicago that year. In any event, it was
                    fascinating to hear how a convention operated. Later in 1940, I visited as a
                    student the Democratic Convention in Chicago and saw first-hand what I'd been
                    hearing on the radio before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time, did the family sit around and listen to
                        thFireside Chats and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Absolutely. The whole family listened to what FDR said. You could hear my
                    father, from time to time, cussing the “God damn Republicans.” When Zangara
                    attempted to assassinate Roosevelt after he was elected, my father came home in
                    tears saying “They will not let that man live to become President.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. Chicago's Mayor Cermak got killed instead.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find, in a way, the feeling abut the Clintons somewhat
                        remindme of the intensity of feelings towards the Roosevelts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Sort of similar. Because of the effects of the Depression still obvious
                    when FDR was elected, I think the appreciation of his administration was deep
                    and heartfelt. A patrician in demeanor, a large portion of the electorate
                    “worshiped” him. Clinton, for all the turmoil while he has been in office, had
                    winning ways - a common touch - and several proposed programs (not all of which
                    succeeded) which appealed to a majority of people through two elections. Both
                    had and have strong critics. FDR was referred to, derisively, as “that man.”
                    Clinton has the name “Slick Willie” and other terms applied by opponents. Both
                    had and have intelligent wives strong enough to offer advice and support but who
                    themselves were and are lightning rods for both admiration and criticism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school, what about extracurricular stuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I participated in speech. I went out for school plays, but I wasn't good
                    enough to get selected. Then there were a series of clubs. I belonged to three
                    of them. I was either president or vice president of all three. One of them was
                    the Philatelic Club, which I organized myself. The other two were the civic and
                    French clubs. Of course, there was the usual athletic events, but I was not
                    athletic. At that time, my favorite spectator sport was basketball. The Kokomo
                    team was very good in those days in basketball.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. I got to know various athletes. They weren't close friends,
                    but they were some of the people that I knew and was impressed by. I would yell
                    for them even though I did not play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were getting ready to go on to college...
                        It was 1934 when you were a senior in high school. Where were you pointed
                        towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: A trip to Chicago served to “point” me. I went on my own - the first time
                    I had been out of Kokomo on my own - to the Chicago World's Fair. It was two
                    years: 1933-1934. I was impressed with a lot of things at the fair, but one of
                    them was the State Department exhibit. One of the things they did was pass out
                    samples of the Foreign Service exam. I could see that it was going to require a
                    lot of knowledge to get together. So, when I went to college, even though I
                    specialized in history, English literature, and political science, my aim was to
                    try to get into the Foreign Service. But the war came along and disrupted the
                    plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the Foreign Service? What was there that stirred an
                        interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: For one thing, my father gave me the bug, I guess. He used to travel
                    around the eastern part of the United States as a hobo. He would bum his way to
                    Cleveland so he could work in Cleveland awhile and go back home. The next time,
                    he would maybe go up to Michigan or elsewhere. It wasn't the work, but the
                    stories he told of bumming, so to speak, that sort of infected me. I also
                    started reading about China, Tibet, and the South Sea islands, and other faraway
                    places. I had the desire to see foreign countries. I figured this was one way to
                    do that. Anyway, it was this that inspired me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the heyday of travel books like Richard
                        Haliburton's New Worlds to Conquer, Pearl Buck's The Good Earth, about
                        China, and his South Sea Tales. I have to ask you this fairly serious
                        question. When you were at the World's Fair in 1933, did you see Sally
                        Rand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, I didn't. I knew about her, and I certainly sapictures of her dances,
                    but in the flesh, so to speak, no.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. Later, I wished I'd seen her because she was the talk of
                    the country. I went to that fair by myself. I had bought in advance a book of
                    tickets for entry to certain attractions. She was not among those. I stayed at
                    the YMCA hotel. It was a short walking distance, maybe a half mile, from the
                    Fair.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: No, I guess I couldn't say I had a plan of action, except that this was
                    what I wanted to do eventually. I majored in history and English literature. I
                    also took courses in geology, French, and philosophy. In order to have something
                    to tie to, I also took courses that were for teachers. I hoped that if I didn't
                    get into the Foreign Service, at least I would be a teacher, for which I felt I
                    was qualified. My aim in the back of my mind, however, was always eventually
                    getting into the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: No, not at all, not until I got to Washington. In 1941, I was offered a
                    job in the State Department as a position classifier in Personnel. But the boss
                    I was working for at Federal Security raised my salary to keep me working there.
                    I also did not feel I could tell the State Department that getting into the
                    Foreign Service was the reason I was interested in that job. The woman who
                    offered me the job would have been interesting to work for. She was competent in

                    government like in later years. I may have talked to individual history
                    instructors or individual students, but there wasn't any outside professional
                    input.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, were dramatic years in both Asia and
                        Europe.Were you following those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. I wrote essays for philosophy, history, and literature. One was on
                    Japanese nationalism. I also wrote a paper on Nazi training of German youth. I
                    can't think of others offhand, but I used current events as inspiration for
                    writing various things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing anything extracurricular?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, not nearly as much as I did in high school. For one thing, I had to
                    do various jobs to supplement my scholarship. I wasn't in any dramatic
                    activities. I did go to the football games, obviously, and the basketball games.
                    But otherwise, it was just social activities such as dances and dinners. I was
                    not a member of a fraternity. I joined the Men's Hall Association. I lived in a
                    dormitory, and there was a dormitory organization. I held a few positions in the
                    Men's Hall Association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During summers or school, what type of work were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: The first year, I had this newspaper route that I told you about. I kept
                    my hands on that route during my first year in college. I hired somebody to do
                    it for me so that the first summer I could earn some money in that way. Then, in
                    later years, I worked for the city, the Democratic Administration. My father
                    arranged it. I made 50 cents an hour. For these three years, I piled up money by
                    working on the streets. The first year, it was really collecting garbage, tree
                    limbs, and all the stuff that people used to dump in their alley. The second and
                    third year, it was primarily working on a truck, where we repaired roads and
                    streets. That is how I built up a bank account. I had a scholarship, of course,
                    but I had to pay for room and board and other activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1938, that was not a good time to get out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. The economy was still uncertain, and jobs for higschool and college
                    students were not plentiful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Depression was still going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, and I had to consider whether to get a job or continue in college. I
                    told you I took courses that gave me a teacher's license for the State of
                    Indiana. During the summer after graduation, I went to various county schools
                    that were closed. The principal or the superintendent was always there. I vowed
                    that any job offering $1,000 or more a year I would take. I went to these
                    various schools and they would say, “You know, you ought to have some
                    experience.” I said, “How can I get experience unless one of you people hires
                    me?” Maybe $850 was the most that any school head offered me for nine months of
                    teaching.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I had applied to the University of Cincinnati and the University
                    of Michigan. I got a scholarship to the University of Michigan. So I went there
                    and got a master's degree the next year. Again, the same principle was in my
                    mind: whoever offers me over $1,000, I'll take the job. Anyway, after receiving
                    a master's degree, I continued to study toward a Ph.D.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A master's degree in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: History, especially American history. My thesis was on Sam Adams and
                    Boston politics in the 1770s. I took a Civil Service Exam, not that I was
                    thinking about getting into the Civil Service. I just figured if I were a
                    political science (my minor) teacher, I ought to know what a Civil Service Exam
                    was like. So I took it. It was for an archivist. I finished it in 25 minutes. I
                    finished it really in less than that, but I went through it again and finished
                    in a total of 25 minutes. I got up and handed it in and walked out. Everybody
                    thought I had failed, that I just couldn't get the right answers. Well, I made a
                    very high mark and was offered $1,620 by the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boy!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I could not turn it down. In 1940, that was big money foone fresh out of
                    college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course not. That was big money.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes! So that is how I got into government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: This was September 1940.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you moved to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. I moved to Washington. I worked first for the Civil Service
                    Commission. It was a boring clerical job. I wrote to my family, telling them,
                    “Well, it's nice money, but it is boring.” I was grading Civil Service Exams.
                    All I had to do was put a template next to the answers and mark plus or minus.
                    In any event, the next thing I know, I was getting a call to come to the Federal
                    Security Agency. They wanted to talk to me. I found that my father again had
                    pulled some strings. At that time, Paul McNutt was the head of Federal Security.
                    But it was a personnel officer with whom I talked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McNutt had Indiana connections.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. He was governor of Indiana. I told you earlier that I went to the
                    Democratic Convention in Chicago in 1940. If the crowd had had its way, McNutt
                    would have been nominated for Vice President, but Roosevelt had already picked
                    Wallace.</p>
                <p>Getting back to the point, the personnel officer at Federal Security calls me in
                    and said he understood I was looking for a job. I said, “How did you find that
                    out?” He said, “Well, we heard from Indiana.” I said, “Well, look, I'm Civil
                    Service. I'm not political.” Stupid me! He smiled and said, “You are looking for
                    another job, aren't you?” I said, “Yes,” so he hired me as a position
                    classification analyst. That really became my second specialty in life. Even now
                    I'm a salary and wage specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain how that type of work was conceived at
                        the time that you were picked up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Even down to the present time, salaries were and are a volatile issue.
                    There was and is a law that laid out a classification of jobs in the Federal
                    Service. The law, like all laws, has a certain generality. So, trained
                    specialists are needed to interpret the various levels. The way I approached the
                    problem was to read the original debates when the act was passed. Consequently,
                    I got a better idea of how the program worked. The other thing was that I had a
                    very good mentor. He was my mentor for several years. He was not a college
                    graduate, but he knew every job in Federal Security. I would audit the job, come
                    back enthused by my findings. He would say,”Well, what about this? What about
                    that? How does it compare to this over there?” He was a good teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you do this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: I continued doing it really throughout the war. This is where I got off
                    track on trying to get into the Foreign Service. I was sure war was coming. I
                    knew it was coming. I would not stand the chance at this point in getting into
                    the Foreign Service. It was 1941 when I started doing position classification. I
                    went into the Army in 1943. Those two years I worked first for Federal Security
                    and then for Army Quartermaster. For the latter I traveled all over the United
                    States. I finally was called up. I went prepared to go to basic training, but
                    Quartermaster wanted me to continue to work for them in uniform. When I was
                    going to the induction station, they said, “Be sure and insist that you get in
                    the Army.” I went through naked, holding my clothes, like the rest of the men,
                    and came to a Marine sergeant, a Navy petty officer, and an Army sergeant. The
                    Marine took one look at me and didn't want me. The Navy guy said, “I'll take
                    him.” He told me to sign a ledger. I started arguing, “I don't want to be in the
                    Navy. I want to be in the Army.” They all looked at one another. Then the petty
                    officer said, “Okay, you can take this guy into the Army. I'll take the next
                    one.” So, I was in the Army. At Camp Lee, they pulled me out early and sent me
                    to Front Royal Remount Depot, still as a private, to hold me so I could take a
                    warrant officer exam. I did, and it was pro forma. It was very interesting. I
                    went down to Washington from Front Royal to take the exam. By the time I got
                    back after the weekend, I couldn't get in the barracks. I had been made an
                    officer immediately and, therefore, I couldn't sleep in the barracks. I had to
                    go out on the town and find a room. Can you imagine that? I then worked for Army
                    Quartermaster, but in California and eventually Utah. By the end of the war, I
                    was in charge of all Quartermaster classification west of the Rockies. Then I
                    came back to Washington where I was in charge, in the name of the Quartermaster
                    General, of all position classification operations in the United States. Later I
                    became head of Position Classification Administration in Germany, the Army of
                    Occupation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: 1946. My wife was there in 1945. She came back recruitinpeople and she
                    recruited me. That is how we met.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still in the Army or were you out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. As a warrant officer, I couldn't serve in Washington. I had to be a
                    lieutenant or above. So they got me out of the Army and made me a civilian so I
                    could head the whole program. There are silly things in life like that. In any
                    event, I was a civilian. I first was head of the Quartermaster program. Then, in
                    1946, I became head of the program in Germany where I helped convert former
                    military personnel to civilian status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from 1949 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Actually, I went in 1946, and in 1947, I came back to get married. I went
                    back in 1948 and then I finally got in the State Department in 1949. The Office
                    of Military Government [OMGUS] was being replaced by the U.S. High Commission
                    [HICOG]. After the war, I was still pursuing and talking to people about getting
                    into the State Department. Consequently, the people who were recruiting knew
                    what my desires were. In 1949, when the U.S. High Commission was established, I
                    was already in Heidelberg working for the Army and they gave me an interview and
                    hired me for HICOG. But they didn't hire me for position classification. It was
                    for what they called “Employee Services,” which involved counseling, training,
                    meeting VIPs, and putting out a newspaper. That is how I entered into the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took this exam where, in Frankfurt or Heidelberg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Initially, I was only hired as a temporary Foreign Service staff member.
                    I guess you know what that was. I was taking a chance. I could have stayed with
                    the Army and probably gone up higher in the Army hierarchy, but instead, I was
                    hired by the State Department for a job in employee services. I was finally in,
                    but it was in personnel work. I continued to work at the High Commission until
                    1951 when I was transferred to London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the High Commission, were you working in
                        Frankfurt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. The Army headquarters had moved to Heidelberg, so had to move to
                    Frankfurt with HICOG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Frankfurt when you were working for
                        thState Department but under HICOG?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: A number of military officers as well as civilians in OMGUS, like me,
                    wanted to get into the HICOG organization. I did not personally make the
                    decision as to who was retained and who was out - that was another section - but
                    I had a lot of employee service work connected with this group, such as
                    counseling, arranging transportation if a person was moved geographically,
                    obtaining housing, and various other problems connected with the changeover.
                    Percentagewise a very small number of former military or OMGUS civilians were
                    taken into the State Department. There was simply an excess of personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think these were called Kreis officers, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, some Kreis officers (U.S. representatives at local level) were
                    converted OMGUS personnel. But the State Department had its own program. Young
                    people with college degrees were recruited as Kreis officers back in Washington
                    and sent over. They were then assigned to various Kreises (the German equivalent
                    to a county). That program was very effective. There had been something like
                    that with the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the war was over, you were ending up with sort of a
                        residue. I think this whole program was designed to make the transition, to
                        get the Army out from under and get the State Department there as an interim
                        force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. They did very well. Some Foreign Service officers whom I
                    later met when I was a Foreign Service officer had started as Kreis
                    officers.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: Oh, they did? Well, I had a few friends in that program. Later on, I
                    realized that it was really good training for Foreign Service officers to be in
                    jobs like that. There were other services for which I was responsible. We had to
                    work on a lot of problems. There were deaths that we handled. It was sort of
                    like consular work. There were consulates in Germany. I wasn't replacing the
                    consuls. But if the person were a HICOG employee, it was my responsibility. We
                    had one fellow who committed suicide. We had people killed in automobile
                    accidents. One officer, when he died, we found out he had two wives, one in
                    Germany and one back in the States, and they both showed up to his funeral at
                    Arlington. Another task was that of putting out a news-type sheet. Also I had a
                    VIP bureau under my wing. For any high-ranking people who came from Washington,
                    my assistants or I would make out their schedule, introduce them to people, and
                    see that they were happy. The VIPs were quite often congressmen. Wayne Hayes was
                    one of them. They were checking on what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? With congressmen, things were
                        relatively cheap. They were getting counterpart funds. I would think it
                        would be a little hard to keep the congressmen “under reservation,” in other
                        words, from going off and hitting the high spots and the low spots.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. After I got into the Department, there were CODELs. We would just
                    make out a schedule for them and they could change their minds: “I don't want to
                    go there” or “I want to go here.” So, we would arrange whatever they wanted. But
                    they enjoyed the PX and local nightlife while they were there, and took back a
                    lot of purchases.</p>

                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the State Department fit
                        into thHigh Commissioner's office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: The officers who were from the Department, the real Department, so to
                    speak, were a bit unhappy to be assigned to jobs in the High Commission unless
                    they were high up. Also, at the consulate, which was in downtown Frankfurt, they
                    didn't like, for example, my entering in when an officer of the consulate
                    committed suicide because they figured it was their role rather than mine, even
                    though I was in the higher echelon. So there was a feeling that “You people
                    aren't the regular Foreign Service.” In a sense, we weren't. I had a Foreign
                    Service staff designation, but I really was just temporary. I had to take an
                    oral exam in Germany to become permanent staff. Then when I got to London, I had
                    to take another exam to get regular Foreign Service officer status. It was step
                    by step.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall when you took the oral exam to get permanent
                        statuas a staff officer? Do you recall any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, I don't recall those as well as I recall the ones in London. Those in
                    Germany were primarily administrative-type questions. I remember, I was so
                    nervous that I would fool around with a pencil in front of me. I flipped it way
                    over in the corner. One of the examiners got up, walked over to the corner, came
                    back, and put it right in front of me. In any event, I passed, along with a
                    number of others. The questions were either administrative facts or cases like
                    “If you had this person killed, how would you handle it? If you were going to go
                    to the government and talk about privileges for our people, what would you say”
                    and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort made to train you to be part of the
                        Department of State or was it just “Here's the job and do it” and you pick
                        it up as you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Sort of the latter. At least, in my case, I had fooled around with the
                    idea for so long, I knew a lot of things to be done. We just picked up knowledge
                    as we went along. That is not a proper statement either. A lot of material we
                    ourselves developed. For example, for new people coming over, whether hired by
                    the State Department or from outside the Department, I developed a handbook to
                    orient them to life in Occupied Germany. We also developed and held training
                    courses for our local staff. I developed outlines for accomplishing each of our
                    employee services. Without my realizing it at the time, this, my first Foreign
                    Service assignment, coupled with my previous Army experience, later helped me in
                    attacking other assignments in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't mentioned the Germans. I realize our structure
                        in Germany was so much that one could have a very satisfactory, very busy,
                        productive career in Germany literally without talking to a German.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. Stepping back a little, when I was with the Army, which led
                    into the same thing under the High Commission, the Germans at first worked for
                    us because they got an 1,800 calorie meal. The money was virtually worthless. It
                    wasn't the money they worked for; it was the food and the possibility of getting
                    tips in food. For example, I always gave my maid a bar of soap and a pack of
                    cigarettes, which was like tripling her salary each week. We were discouraged
                    from associating with Germans outside of work. That was the situation in the
                    Army. Under HICOG, the Americans were a little closer to the Germans because by
                    then the organization was aiming to prepare Germany for sovereignty. The Germans
                    at HICOG were more experienced and at higher grades. They worked in both
                    administrative and substantive positions. We had certain training courses
                    directed specifically at German staff. By that time, we could and did associate
                    with Germans outside of work. Glenn Wolfe, the administrative officer, developed
                    a program where groups of Germans and their wives were invited to several
                    American (HICOG) homes on the same night. There we had a couple of hours of
                    binational discussion aimed toward understanding each other, followed by a
                    serving of food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in HICOG, your work was still pretty
                        welconcentrated within the American working community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: 1951. Before that, I took the oral exam that made me permanent Foreign
                    Service staff. Being permanent, I was eligible for transfer to other posts. At
                    first I thought I was going to go to, of all places, Manila, which I got to
                    years later. Somebody else had staked out London, but much to my surprise, he
                    turned down that job. I was thus assigned to London as personnel officer. That
                    was February 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in London from 1951 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: 1954. Then I was in Cardiff, Wales from 1954 to the end o1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stick to London first. What was the embassy like
                        when yoarrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Big. SHAFE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Forces Europe) was there. That
                    office later was transferred to Paris. But the embassy itself was very big. For
                    example, the Political Section had several political officers. Their role was
                    divided into British relations with Asia, British relations with Africa, British
                    relations with the U.S., etc. It not only was big in terms of personnel, we were
                    scattered around Grosvenor's Square in one five story building and several old
                    Georgian houses. Workwise, there wasn't any feeling that I was an outsider. By
                    that time, I was considered an insider. Two things happened in my case. One,
                    personnel administration, big as the job was, didn't keep me busy. I talked to
                    my boss about it, did he have anything else? The first thing he did was make me
                    protocol officer in additional to personnel work. Queen Mary had died at that
                    time. I had developed a protocol book based on her funeral and other
                    arrangements. Then, of course, the Queen was coronated about a year after I got
                    there. Anyway, I was protocol officer, responsible for assuring that officers
                    and staff were advised of the British way of doing things...</p>
                <p>In staff meetings, they kept talking about an emergency project. They talked
                    about the need to get it “moving.” Finally, being new, I said, “What is it we're
                    talking about?” They said, “It's emergency evacuation. So and So was doing it.
                    He's gone and we need somebody.” I didn't say it in the meeting, but I went
                    around to the administrative officer later and said, “Is there any way I can
                    help on this?” So I took on a job that practically doubled my work. I found the
                    previous officer had made only a few notes on legal paper. Otherwise, there was
                    a file of books and manuals on evacuation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about E&amp;E (emergency evacuation)
                        plans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. Over the next year, I developed a plan for evacuation of
                    Americans plus certain others from Europe in case the Russians started rolling
                    over the borders. Consequently, we had good relations with the British. They
                    were going to use the British navy and we would pick evacuees up at certain
                    specified points. The big problem was that the previous incumbents of this job
                    had been using the total annual tourist figures. In other words, 400,000
                    tourists in Europe, and the Russians start rolling across. Well, I pointed out
                    finally that all 400,000 in a year would not all be there at one time. The
                    number was going to be considerably less than that, probably 50,000 in summer.
                    We changed the evacuation plan accordingly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too, as the tensions go up, tourism goes down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. There were also plans for taking out othediplomats and
                    selected foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about being protocol officer. What sort of
                        problems diyou have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: One thing was that everybody had to be accredited to the foreign office.
                    Believe it or not, some of our military people stationed in Singapore and Hong
                    Kong because these were British territories, had to be accredited by the foreign
                    office in London and put on the embassy's diplomatic list. Periodically I sent
                    them groups of invitations to official British functions, knowing the attach�s
                    would never appear. A more major task was seeing that all new officers were
                    accredited by the foreign office soon after they arrived. There were certain
                    laws and regulations relating to utilities, renting, leasing, etc., which I had
                    to explain. I handled cases of complaints of some American staff about living
                    conditions. One example - a British woman living below an American fed cats on
                    the steps. The complaint was there were always food scraps at the bottom of his
                    steps. I had to go to the foreign office to see if there was anything which
                    could be done about the problem. It persuaded her to clean up after the
                    cats.</p>
                <p>Another case: a man wanted to present a sword to Eisenhower, who was President.
                    This father came in with his grown son. They had this very rusty looking sword
                    that had the Swiss spelling of Eisenhower along its blade. The son wanted to
                    present it to the President. I accepted it. Then I took it down to the shop in
                    the embassy and had them polish it. It looked beautiful. Then we had the problem
                    of getting it to Washington. There weren't any funds for it. The DCM was going
                    back and he took it on his leave. He knew Eisenhower, so he presented it.</p>
                <p>A lot of the protocol was routine. Every officer who was assigned, during his or
                    her first year was invited to one night reception at the palace and one garden
                    reception. Only the senior officers went every year. I had to make out a
                    schedule and make sure all the officers got their appearance before the court,
                    so to speak.</p>
                <p>Another task involved people just coming up and asking me: “I'm going to have a
                    dinner next Friday. Will you rank these guests for me?” I could easily rank the
                    Americans. I had to do a little studying if there were foreigners involved, as I
                    had to find out which ambassador or which counselor outranked the other.</p>
                <p>In addition to the emergency evacuation and protocol, the next thing that came up
                    was the purchase of scarce or special books. The officer who had the job was
                    leaving. The political counselor wanted somebody to do it. They wanted me to do
                    it. The administrative counselor, however, put his foot down and said, “No. He's
                    got too much as it is.” So I never purchased books for the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in presentations at court? I recall
                        reading the diary of someone who was our sort of third secretary in London
                        from 1854-1870 or something like that. One of the big things that he had to
                        worry about was wealthy Americans bringing their daughters to be presented
                        at court. Had that gone by the time you had the protocol job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, I never got involved in anything of that sort that I recall. They may
                    have consulted somebody higher up. There was a rule that the daughter of any
                    woman who had been presented at court could ask for her daughter's
                    presentation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about congressional delegations? Did that
                        develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Not in London. My biggest job in that was in Manila. There were
                    congressional delegations, like there were in HICOG, in Germany, but they were
                    usually handled by the political officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a lady who was very well-known, an Englishwoman,

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I think you are referring to Jane Autin. During my time she worked in
                    General Services, handling housing matters. After I left apparently she arranged
                    VIP visit schedules. Perhaps some protocol matters. In any event, she got praise
                    from Kissinger and other high ranking officials. She was, as you noted, an FSN.
                    When she died a few years ago, her obituary was in the Department

                <p>BEAMAN: Walter Gifford; he was from AT&amp;T. He was the first ambassador. He was
                    succeeded by Winthrop Aldrich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the ambassador from your point of view make much of a
                        difference or life just went on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I assume the ambassador had connections with the palace and with the
                    high-ranking political people. In working on this emergency evacuation, I quite
                    often went with the political counselor to the foreign office to exchange ideas
                    with the British. Those were the days when Churchill was the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassadors come and go. Gifford, I don't think he's

                <p>BEAMAN: I remember him because I was taking him someplace where he was supposed
                    to make a speech and he was worried about his suit, whether his suit looked all
                    right. The other memory of him is that at a garden party, he and Adlai Stevenson
                    were walking along together, and it dawned on me that Stevenson was not a tall
                    man, as I thought he was. Back home, they talked about his being a new Lincoln,
                    but he and Gifford were both short men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rotund and small.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. As you know, Stevenson died on the steps othe embassy in
                    later years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you making any moves about getting an FSO appointment
                        whilyou were in London? You left in 1954 and went to Cardiff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. There was the oral exam for Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Very definitely. I gave you this paper on Wristonization. You might want
                    to cover this special topic later. But in any event, I set up the schedule for
                    the examination. There were 40 people in London who had applied to become
                    regular Foreign Service officers. I set up the schedule and, of course, I was
                    scheduled also. There were five officers who came to give the exam. One was an
                    ambassador. There were two political counselors. One was from Agriculture. I
                    think maybe the other was from USIS. In any event, there were five of them that
                    examined me. I estimated that in a few hours time, they threw about 100
                    questions at me. If they saw I was beginning to answer correctly, they quickly
                    moved to another question. I had been advised by Foreign Service officer
                    friends, “Look, if you don't know an answer, say so. Let them go on to the
                    next.” So I did that. Whenever I didn't feel confident to answer, I said so. The
                    questions were more substantive than the original exam that I took in Germany. I
                    tried to anticipate their questions. I read the “Times of London,” cover to
                    cover, including the court calendar and everything else, for about three or four
                    months before the exam. I reasoned that because I had served in Germany, they
                    were going to ask me questions about Germany. I had all of the monthly
                    publications from HICOG. I reread those. I also reasoned that while I was in the
                    Army, I was stationed in California and Utah, so they would probably ask me
                    statistical-type information about the West. They did. Exactly. Then they would
                    ask such questions as “What should we do about the Oder-Neisse Line?” I said,
                    “Well, unless we're willing to fight the Russians, I think we just have to leave
                    it as it is for the time being.” The substantive-type questions were on current
                    events. In any event, I was the only one approved out of the 40. I don't think
                    that was right. There were others who were, I figured, equally qualified, but
                    for whatever reason, they didn't select them. I hate to point a finger, but I
                    feel part of the reason was that the old Foreign Service, as I might call it,
                    was reluctant to take in much new blood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. The Wriston program was fought tooth and
                        nail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. I came in under Section 517. I had done enough work that related to
                    the Foreign Service that they were willing to accept me. An interesting thing
                    was this: I had friends who were regular Foreign Service officers, but I had
                    never been invited to their parties because the parties were usually for
                    political purposes or a trade delegation, which were not my field. I was a
                    personnel officer. Only after they had heard that I had passed the exam, I
                    wasn't even an officer yet, they started inviting me to their homes. That was
                    one angle. The other angle was that when the appointment finally came through,
                    Washington said I could not continue to be a personnel officer and be a Foreign
                    Service officer. Consequently, they assigned me to Cardiff. The Department
                    considered Cherbourg and Cardiff. They found out Mrs. Beaman was pregnant, and
                    they said, “Oh, we don't want to send him to Cherbourg. An easier move would be
                    to send him to Cardiff.” So I was moved to Cardiff to become principal officer
                    strictly because, as a Foreign Service officer at that time, I could not be in
                    administrative work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Cardiff from 1954 to 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. It was a little over a year. My son was born a couple of months
                    after we got there, and I think he was a year and a half old when I was approved
                    for Arabic language training. That was another thing that I kept trying to get.
                    I had the feeling that the Arabic side of the story of Middle East turmoil was
                    not being heard. Not that I was against Israel. In fact, in visiting Israel, I
                    understood their situation, and I used to tell the Arabs when I got assigned
                    there, “Look, you're not going to push those people into the sea. They have an
                    excellent army, an excellent economy, and a united country.” I had applied for
                    Arabic language training sometime before. From Cardiff, we had gone home on
                    leave and were going to come back to Cardiff. By the time I got to Washington,
                    they said, “We are assigning you to Arab language training.” The reason was that
                    they had previously assigned a person who was Jewish. They didn't know that he
                    was Jewish, and when they found out, they said, “Oh, we can't do this. Beaman's
                    been after the assignment, so give it to him.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about Cardiff. Technically, it was
                        thequivalent to the capital of Wales?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It officially became the capital of Wales after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the principal city of Wales.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: That's right. Even though I wanted to get into economic work and an Arab
                    specialty, that was one of my best posts. It was best because, first, my son was
                    born there and local friends celebrated with us by sending gifts and flowers.
                    But the other thing was that I was my own boss. Not belittling, but the norm of
                    previous consuls had been to clip items out of the newspaper, put them in a
                    report, and send them to London. I started visiting people. I visited workers
                    institutes in the coal mine areas. I even went down into the coal mine. I came
                    up saying, “They can have that job. I don't want it.” I had to drive the
                    official car myself. I would just jump in the car and go up in the valleys or go
                    over to Swansea and go through a steel mill. I had a grand time. I did a lot of
                    speaking and visiting. I also made certain friends, like a Labour MP by the name
                    of George Thomas, who later became speaker of the House of Commons and
                    eventually Viscount Tony Pandy. We had a friendship that lasted 40 years before
                    he died a couple of years ago. When I sent condolences to the newspaper
                    respecting his death, I got letters from people who went back to my time. They
                    were writing to me or my wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns? What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: I was trying to project a good image of the United States. Those were the
                    days when Dulles was Secretary. Unfortunately, the State Department would put
                    out very dull booklets of very dull speeches that he made and would send those
                    to the consulate. I put them out on the consulate's counter or I would
                    distribute them to officials. But this wasn't the way to do it. That is why I
                    made a lot of speeches. I tried to interpret U.S. policy or what was going on to
                    the people. Once, I went down to a seaman's institute on the docks. I expected
                    heat from the seamen, but after my talk they came around and wanted me to have
                    tea with them. These were blacks mostly, and they were asking about segregation
                    in the U.S. It was the first time a consul had been there. Whether they agreed
                    with what I had to say, that's beside the point. The fact is that I was down
                    there trying to interpret the things that we were being connected with. One of
                    my memories is the time the U.S. was warning China about its threatening Taiwan.
                    Here I am, the consul, walking along the street. They knew me. They would come
                    up and stand in front of me, grab my lapels, and say, “You're trying to get us
                    into war over Quemoy and Matsu.” I would just back off and laugh and say, “What
                    are you talking about?” Then, I gave a paragraph talk on U.S. policy. It was
                    fun. It was probably my best post.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, but I had a vice consul who just loved to sign and process papers. I
                    left most of that to him. I would sign when it was expected.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, not completely. George Thomas was Labour. He represented Cardiff
                    West. Callahan, another Labour MP, represented the dock area. Beyond that, the
                    MPs were Tories, as were a number of city officials. I cultivated both sides.
                    The pubs were closed on Sunday, so I held my cocktail parties on Sunday after
                    church. I had Tories and Labour people mixed together.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: No, they were people who spoke their minds, but I didn't regard them as
                    being anti-U.S. People on the dock I expected to be and maybe some of them were
                    even after I had been there. Nevertheless, they were receptive and basically

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I had a little taste of it. But the people weren't necessarily from
                    Cardiff. In Britain, they have a practice that they call “Brain Trust.” They
                    liked to hold these sessions periodically. They would choose a couple of people
                    from each side, Labour versus Conservative, and have a moderator. These people
                    would voice their opinions. Well, I went to all of those that I knew about.
                    There would be Labour people maybe from elsewhere, not necessarily from the
                    Cardiff area, who were very left-leaning. At times, they would even talk about
                    the American consul. They didn't know that I was there. In any event, these
                    brain trusts provided material for reports. I had an easy way of sending reports
                    in with what I figured was substantive material rather than clipping newspapers.
                    There was one woman. I can't remember her name now. She was very leftist,
                    inclined to spout the communist line vis a vis the U.S. But even George Thomas,
                    who was my Labourite friend, through the years, he was a moderate. At the time
                    he became Speaker of the House, he had to be nationalized, so to speak. He
                    couldn't be on either side. So, when they held elections while he was Speaker,
                    he had to run on a national ticket. He was reelected.</p>
                <p>Cardiff was a post that I was sorry I didn't get back to. I enjoyethe Welsh

                    do well at it. Not so. Friends in the Department later said they would have sent

                <p>BEAMAN: At the time, I felt that our policies were not fully considering the
                    importance of the Arabs to our security (both oil and alliances). This was not
                    being critical of Israel because I considered both sides. At the same time, I
                    felt the Arabs were critical of the U.S. when they should not be (I had an
                    example of this when I was later assigned to Damascus). About the time I was
                    assigned to Arabic class, my closest friend was Cleo Noel, who was assassinated
                    in Khartoum. George [Curt] Moore, who was assassinated there, was also in the
                    class along with Ned Shaefer, John Gatch, and a couple of men from USIS. I don't
                    think any of us were strongly pro-Arab over Israel although the press has often
                    talked about the Arabist “elite” in the State Department. We were all
                    pro-U.S.</p>

                    Arabic. We had people like Parker T. Hart and Ambassador Raymond Hare who had
                    been the forerunners by several years in this specialty. What I wanted to do was
                    to specialize in the Arabic world and economics. I found that I just wasn't good
                    at Arabic. I could carry on a rudimentary conversation in Arabic, but I couldn't
                    have negotiated in Arabic. Curt Moore, who was killed, could have. Cleo, I
                    think, maybe wasn't as good as Moore, but he was certainly better than I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started this class in Washington or in Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I started in Washington. In those days, we studied in Washington from
                    January to September. August is when we actually moved to Beirut to finish the
                    course. After I was no longer connected with it, the Department transferred the
                    course to Beirut. There later was an Arabic language school in Tunis. We found
                    really that western Arabic was not like the Near East Arabic. So, at that time,
                    I was in both Washington and Beirut. That was at a time that Dulles turned down
                    a plea for us to help with the High Aswan Dam. Of the whole class, I was the one
                    that said it was a bad move. The rest of the class felt Nasser should be slapped
                    down. I later found in documents, however, that Dulles could not have made a
                    different decision because the Congress would not have supported him. That took
                    me a few years to learn. My opinion was that we should have tried to help build
                    the High Aswan Dam. Bad feeling grew out of the way it was done diplomatically.
                    Apparently, we had been talking to the Egyptians, and Dulles just came out,
                    pulled the rug out and said, “No.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been told by people that there was a visceral
                        dislike of Dulles for Nasser and probably the reverse. From our point of
                        view, Dulles really enjoyed doing this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I would say so, just by the method used in rejection. Speaking of Dulles
                    and stepping back a little, when I was in London as personnel officer there was
                    what we called the “Dulles reduction in force.” He had a concept of an ivory
                    tower-type of Foreign Service. He wanted to get rid of the whole Foreign Service
                    staff. He wanted them transferred to the Civil Service or whatever. I don't know
                    how he expected to do that. That is why in here I've got a note that it was a
                    mistake. These people were required to run the embassies and so on. It was one
                    of the most difficult parts of my work in London. I had grown men come in and
                    cry in my office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I kept tabs on everybody who had been reduced in force. I couldn't keep
                    tabs on the secretaries very well. In any event, officers and specialists, I
                    kept tabs on them. Within one year, practically all of them had been rehired by
                    the State Department. For example, Andy Killgore (I later met with him in the
                    Arab language training) was a consul there, not the top consul, but a consul. He
                    came to my office. He didn't cry. He was mad. He walked up and down just mad as
                    Hell. All I could to was talk to try to soothe him. He returned to Washington
                    and they put him in Security. Then they got him into Arab language training and
                    eventually he became an ambassador. Life is interesting at times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time and when you got to Beirut, did you get any
                        feeling about the motivation of the people who came? The reason I'm asking
                        is that there is this thing that has been put out, particularly from Israeli
                        sources, that American Foreign Service officers who were Arabists are
                        essentially anti-Semitic and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, I challenge that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for why people were signing up for
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Like in my own case, it wasn't anti-Semitic. It was just our belief on
                    policy in general. I don't know of anyone who had any anti-Semitic or
                    anti-Israeli feelings. They might have disagreed with what Israel had been
                    doing, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they hated Israelis. No, I would
                    challenge that. They'd have to prove it to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right from the beginning, the Israelis seemed to have had
                        this “If you're not 100% with us, you're against us. If you're against us,
                        you're anti-Semitic.” Also, it was a way of diminishing the impact of our
                        Arab experts, who were saying, “You've got other interests than Israeli
                        interests in the Middle East.” In a way, it did kind of work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: In my case, I'm not saying what the cases were for Curt Moore or Cleo
                    Noel or anyone else, but for most of them, this was a career. This was a home
                    where they could help shape policy. In my case, as I say, it's because I felt
                    that the Arab story had not been completely exposed and talked about back in the
                    States. But on the other hand, having visited Israel (I first visited Israel in
                    1951), I knew it was not going to be pushed “into the sea” (as the Arabs
                    boasted). The Arab armies were not as good in discipline and tactics as the
                    Israeli army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that looking at the Arab armies, that they
                        didn'appear very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It was my view. I wasn't a military man, but it was just that their
                    discipline, looks, and demeanor were not “spit and polish.” I felt that they
                    would not overwhelm and push the Israelis into the sea. The Jordanian army was
                    the best. That army, however, was trained by the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Beirut from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I got there in September of 1956. I left about a year after that. The
                    reason was that Cleo and I had signed under one directive of the State
                    Department where it said something to the effect “one year's Arab training.” The
                    Department was going to have us do two years. Cleo and I both said, “We didn't
                    sign on for that.” Of course, as I wasn't very good at Arabic, I reasoned why
                    spend another year at it? So we were assigned out early. I was assigned to
                    Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the course in Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: We had Palestinian Arabs, and we had Syrians and Lebanese. The Arabic is
                    slightly different among those countries, but the course was well organized.
                    There was a fellow by the name of Frank Rice, who was a language technician and
                    specialist. He ran it. Medjid Said was his chief Arab assistant both in
                    Washington and eventually in Beirut. We had classes about six hours a day. A lot
                    of it had to do with grammar and learning to write in Arabic, but also we had
                    little skits that we played out. For example, you have an American citizen who
                    has been arrested and is in an Arab jail. One person plays the Arab official and
                    another person plays the Foreign Service officer trying to get him out of jail.
                    Or somebody comes in with false credentials for a visa, and what do you do to
                    challenge the applicant? I felt it was good play acting. I helped write some of
                    the scripts. Then, of course, there was a long field trip. The whole class was
                    taken. We went to Ankara, Baghdad, Teheran, and Saudi Arabia on a circular tour.
                    In each place, people talked to us about their problems. Turkey and Iran were
                    not Arabic, but nevertheless, they were on the tour. I remember, in order to get
                    to Israel, we had to fly to Cyprus and backtrack to Israel. It was a well run
                    course. There is no question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the October '56 Arab-Israeli
                        conflict? Could you explain how it came about, what you were all doing and
                        how it was perceived at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It came about when Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. He took this
                    action because the U.S. and Britain had refused to help with the Aswan Dam
                    project. Israel invaded the Gaza Strip and the Sinai. Britain and France invaded
                    the Canal Zone. Our concern in Beirut was to help American citizens get out of
                    Israel, Jordan, and Syria, over the border into Lebanon. The school director
                    sent several “advanced” Arabic students to help with the exit. My class were
                    “beginners,” so we were not sent. As you know, international pressure,
                    especially from the U.S., induced Britain, France, and Israel to pull out of
                    Egypt. My feeling, and I think that of some of the other Arabists, was that the
                    turnover of the Canal should have been a negotiated shift. The Canal Zone was a
                    part of Egypt, but Nasser's belligerent marching in with troops and closing down
                    British and French businesses turned us off. A myth grew up that the Egyptians
                    had succeeded in expelling the French and the British and had beaten them - this
                    despite the fact that Port Said, a lot of it, was damaged by bombs. I later was
                    assigned to Egypt and to Port Said. The myth still was that Egypt had won, even
                    though they hadn't militarily. Diplomatically, it was largely U.S. intervention
                    that got the three invaders to pull back. But we never got any credit from
                    Nasser for the intervention. We were ranked with so-called “imperialists.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we all learned, the myth is often more important in the
                        Arabic world than reality. For example, there are still Egyptians today who
                        think that American planes attacked in the 1967 War the Egyptian air
                        force.</hi>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. I was in Syria at that time. Absolutely, that is what they believed.
                    I was DCM then. I went with a political officer to talk to officials at the
                    foreign office. They were accusing us directly of participating in this
                    invasion, which, of course, we denied. We had gone over there to deliver a
                    message from President Johnson. We got lambasted. That was in the morning and by
                    evening, they were telling us that we had two days to get out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Lebanese responding to the Suez Crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I don't know that I can answer with any exactitude. The Lebanese played a
                    temporizing role. They wanted to be considered Arabic, but at the same time,
                    there was a lot of French influence particularly in Lebanon. They didn't want to
                    give that up. But they were on the side of the Arab criticism in the newspapers
                    and on the radio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy intrude at all on you in Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. We were sort of separate. The only intrusion was that they gave us a
                    title that wasn't “Foreign Service officer” on their protocol list. Even though
                    we were all Foreign Service officers, we were not considered a part of the
                    embassy Foreign Service officer group. So, on the accreditation list, we were
                    separate. We had a descriptive title of “language specialists.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought we might stop at this point. You were assigned

                <p>***This is October 30, 1999. You mentioned in talking about HICOG that one of the
                    differences between your set of officers and the others was what?</p>
                <p>BEAMAN: HICOG took over from the military government. So a lot of the people were
                    from the military government, but in my case, I had been working for the Army
                    headquarters and was hired by the State Department for the personnel program.
                    But there was a difference that I had forgotten to mention earlier - namely,
                    that those of us who were Foreign Service Staff were only temporary. Secondly,
                    we had “official” passports rather than diplomatic passports. That was what drew
                    the line between the regular Foreign Service and us. As a matter of fact, I had
                    quite a bit to do with passports. I had to approve, put a stamp in the
                    passports, that the individuals were employees of the High Commission. I think
                    the thing was that there were so many, it would have considerably increased the
                    number of diplomatic passports, which the Department did not want to do. They
                    knew at that time that all of them were not going to stay on. Later, while still
                    in Germany, I was examined and was made a permanent Foreign Service Staff
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you got a diplomatic passport.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. When I was transferred to London, I got a diplomatipassport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1957, you went to Cairo. You were in Cairo from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I got to Cairo in 1957, and I was there until 1959. Then I was
                    transferred to Port Said. In the 1957-1959 period, I finally got economic work.
                    I went there as consul. I was disappointed at that. I had been a principal
                    officer before Arabic language training. I had taken Arabic language training,
                    and I was still a consul. I wasn't even a principal officer. But about partway
                    through that period, the Department transferred me within the embassy to an
                    economic position. An interesting thing, one of the reasons I was assigned was,
                    in the exam that I had taken in London, the Commerce representative on the panel
                    had recommended me for a commercial job. So I was transferred, and I did both
                    commercial work and economic reporting. There was a regular commercial attach�.
                    I was just the deputy to him. One of the things that I spent a good deal of my
                    time on was keeping an eye on various aid projects from the Soviet Bloc,
                    primarily Czechoslovakia and Russia.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Our relations with Egypt at that time were unstable. The time was after
                    Secretary Dulles had said, “No” to the U.S. helping with the High Aswan Dam. Of
                    course, even before that, the Egyptians had been getting a lot of assistance
                    from the Soviet Bloc, primarily Czechoslovakia. The Russians were going to help
                    with the High Dam. It was part of my job to find out what planning was going on.
                    During a trip to Aswan, I was briefed by an Egyptian official. We used a boat to
                    get nearer to the current dam. He proved to me that the Egyptians had already
                    carefully formulated plans for building the dam. He also said the Russians had
                    some different ideas about how to approach the construction. They would have
                    preferred the U.S. give help in building the dam. Another work project was that
                    as a result of the 1957 clash with the British over the Canal, it was closed for
                    some time. There was a need to report on Egyptian plans to open it up, how soon
                    it was going to accept traffic. Later on, after my economic assignment, I was
                    posted to Port Said. By that time, the Canal was open. Strangely enough, the
                    Authority had employed a U.S. Army engineer ship to dredge the Canal along with
                    two American dredging companies. To answer your question, when I was there it
                    was very difficult to cultivate Egyptians. Nasser was angry with the United
                    States. Everything we Americans did was watched. For example, when I invited
                    locals to my house in Cairo, some guests would park their cars several blocks
                    away and walk the rest of the way. After I was assigned to Port Said and I put
                    on large parties, I would always invite key officials and businessmen. A lot of
                    them wouldn't show up. They wanted the invitations, my deputy found, but they
                    did not want to be seen at big parties. So there was a disparity of feeling:
                    they'd like to be courteous but were afraid of government spies. The police knew
                    wherever I was along the Canal. Yet once the governor and police commissioner
                    attended a speech I gave at the USIS center on “Life in the U.S.” I should note
                    they also watched the Russian consul.</p>
                <p>Nasser came to Port Said every year to make a speech on the day of the supposed
                    victory over the British. At these times he would be very critical of Britain
                    and the United States in his speeches. I, as consul, had to debate in my mind
                    whether I should get up and walk out. I didn't at any time. One of the reasons
                    was, they locked the gates. When Nasser made his speech, they locked the gates,
                    and one couldn't get out. Anyway, there was a very tenuous situation in our
                    relations. On the other hand, working as I did in economics and commercial work,
                    I had quite a series of contacts in the Cairo ministries that dealt with
                    economic matters. I had several official contacts in Port Said whom I could see
                    directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have many contacts? You mentioned you got special
                        tours.Who was the ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Raymond Hare. At the end, there was Frederick Reinhardt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that you could really call on
                        thgovernment, do your normal diplomatic thing? Was that a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: No great problem. In fact, when I was still consul in Cairo, the
                    ambassador commented in a staff meeting one time that I seemed to have a lot of
                    contacts. His reasoning was that the title “consul” was historic in Egypt as
                    being a very important person. He felt that because I was consul, I had
                    developed more contacts strictly on the title. A lot of these contacts were
                    developed for tourism purposes. Egyptians going to the States had to get
                    approval from their government before we could issue them a visa. Also, several
                    visiting Americans got themselves in trouble. Sometimes I'd get a call late at
                    night from the airport that So and So was being thrown out and the Americans
                    wanted to see the consul. In one case, I got to the airport and said, “Well, I'm
                    the consul. What can I do for you?” He said, “Oh, I just wanted somebody to talk
                    to until I got on the plane.” But in any event, there were very few times when
                    they evicted an American. One of the big case problems was when we had a group
                    of students who had been signed on by a tour operator. They got to Cairo and
                    were taking unauthorized pictures. Tourists were not supposed to take pictures
                    of presumed military stuff. That was one problem. Another problem was that they
                    had been left high and dry by their tour agency. The Egyptian government was
                    begging me to get them out of the country. Similarly, when I was consul at Port
                    Said, one of the big incidents that I had to handle was that of a ship called
                    “Valiant Faith.” It came into port after we had received a telegram saying that
                    the crew was almost mutinous. It had stopped at Gibraltar and crew members had
                    talked to their wives. They found their wives had not gotten their paychecks,
                    which should have been sent to their homes. The crew was angry, and the captain
                    used the word “mutinous.” When they arrived in Port Said, there were very angry
                    sailors who poured out on the streets. The local governor asked me to please get
                    them out of there. We did. If an American ship went through and had a berth, the
                    consulate could insist that the ship take this or that “beach” sailor. There
                    were about 30 of them, and over a period of a month or so, we finally got them
                    all on American ships going out. The captain stayed behind to handle
                    ship-related matters. The ship company itself was financially broke. “Valiant
                    Faith” had come in under an American flag and was there for over a year. I had
                    left by that time. It sailed out under a Greek flag. Our problem was that it was
                    filled with wheat. I can't remember whether it was hard or soft wheat. I think
                    it was soft wheat, which was on its way to India. Well, the Egyptians don't
                    usually eat soft wheat products. They like the hard wheat for their bread. So it
                    was a matter of our just sitting in on negotiations between the captain and
                    local people to arrange for turning the cargo over to the Egyptians instead of
                    getting it to India where it was supposed to go... Port Said was an interesting
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>I got assigned to Port Said, incidentally, after I had been assigned in Cairo to
                    economic work for the first time. I was sent to Port Said because they had
                    successively assigned two other officers there and for some reason, they were
                    transferred elsewhere. The Department was getting a little desperate. The fellow
                    who had been there had left, and it was open. So I was assigned to Port Said.
                    But I was able to do some economic reporting on the Canal in addition to
                    handling consular and representation duties.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you followed much? Were the Egyptian police a

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Oh, yes, particularly when I was consul in Port Said. They knew where I
                    was at any one time. They had informants along the Canal. If I would go take a
                    trip down the Canal for any reason, they knew where I was exactly. The same way
                    they kept an eye on us around Port Said, not only me, but the others in the
                    consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went down when they were getting ready for the
                        High Dam, what was your impression on how it was going - and what was that
                        of the economic counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Actually, the Egyptians had it well planned. They had been working on the
                    project for several years. They had their own ideas. At the moment, I can't
                    remember the difference between their plan and what the Russians did, but in any
                    event, they had a complete plan when I went for this visit. I thought, well, the
                    Egyptians are really set up. One of the things that irritated them was that when
                    the Russians came in to help, the Russians had insisted on following their own
                    ideas as to how the dam should be built. I think probably in the long run, it
                    was a compromise. They just didn't see eye to eye despite the fact that the
                    Russians were helping them build it. It was finished after I left. I later got
                    back to Egypt and was able to see it. The economic counselor never questioned my
                    reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was concern when the planning was being done that
                        what would happen would be that Egypt depended so much on the Nile flow and
                        including the sediment in the waters that the dam might stop the sediments
                        and the water would not be as nutritious. Was that a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It was a factor for consideration at the time. As I say, I've been back
                    afterwards a couple of times (latest 1990). Water from Lake Nasser has led to a
                    lot of agricultural development below the dam. Also, industry has moved
                    upstream. After a consulting project, I signed up for a tour coming from Aswan
                    down to Luxor by ship. One of the things that disturbed me was that there were
                    industries with their belching smoke along the Nile. I felt it was spoiling the
                    atmosphere. The dam had been an excellent plan for them really. There is more
                    food and more industries now in a growing Egypt. No question the High Dam
                    eventually did improve things in Egypt. They've got a large population, so I
                    don't know whether the improvement has kept up with growth or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We weren't doing an AID project while you were there, were
                        we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: AID wasn't there. At the time of the Suez Crisis, AID pulled out. When I
                    got to Cairo, there was just the AID comptroller who had remained behind because
                    of projects that had been funded. But then AID came back again. Most of this was
                    after I had left. As you're probably aware, Egypt is one of our biggest clients
                    in the matter of receiving U.S. aid.</p>
                <p>Also, of course, we had NAMRU (Navy Medical Research Unit) there. It continued to
                    operate despite the bad feelings. The Egyptians wanted NAMRU to stay because
                    NAMRU was helping do vital studies, including the West Nile fever that we in the
                    U.S. are talking about now. That was and is one of their major research
                    projects. I could see also when the Persian Gulf War came later, a lot of the
                    things that they told me were being studied was used in handling the troops in
                    that war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived at the embassy, what was the attitude
                        that you were picking up from the ambassador and others who were talking
                        about Nasser?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Ambassador Hare was very good. He spoke Arabic, so he could keep in close
                    touch with the government. The same thing with the political counselor and to a
                    certain extent the economic counselor, but it was more a political situation. We
                    were trying to get back in their good graces vis a vis U.S. policy and planning.
                    The thing was, though, that Nasser already had his mind made up on a lot of
                    things, and he particularly was angry because we didn't help him with the High
                    Aswan Dam. There had been talks going on, but as I mentioned earlier, Dulles
                    just pulled the rug out from under the idea. It was the way it was done rather
                    than it being done or not. If there had been some negotiations and saying,
                    “Well, we can't agree on this. Sorry,” it would have left a little better
                    feeling. But he just issued a statement. Nasser was expecting the United States
                    to help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much sign of Soviet and Czech activity
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: They provided funds. The Russians were concentrating primarily on the
                    High Aswan Dam. It was the Czechs and maybe some other East Europeans which
                    helped on getting industries started in Egypt. As I said, I was supposed to keep
                    up on this. I would read in the paper that down 30 or so miles from Cairo, they
                    had built a factory. I would go down there in my own car and find there wasn't
                    anything there. I finally said to somebody at the economic ministry, “Look, I
                    read in the paper that you've built a factory at a certain place and the Czechs
                    helped you. But it's not where the paper said it was.” They said, “Well, the
                    Arabs, if something is formulated, they consider it done.” “You've got to think
                    like an Arab” is what they were saying. “You Americans expect stuff to be done
                    when it's published.” The same thing happened at Port Said when they built a
                    clinic for women to help with childbirth. I went with Mary to the dedication,
                    and I found it had no water. Here is a medical outfit where obviously a lot of
                    water is going to be needed, and they hadn't put the water in. Yet they were
                    dedicating the “clinic” with a lot of speeches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Port Said from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Just before July 4, 1959. I was there for the July Fourtparty. Then I
                    left about two years later in March 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that had been said when Nasser
                        nationalized the Suez Canal was that the Brits and the French were
                        saying,”Oh, these Egyptians can't run the Canal.” That wasn't too long
                        before you got there. Was this one of the things you were tasked to look at
                        and see how the Canal was running? What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I was expected to report regularly on Suez Canal activities. I felt they
                    were doing all right. Of course, during the period when I was there, the
                    Egyptians were devoting effort to clearing the Canal of silt and debris which
                    had accumulated. The Canal had silted up during the period of its closure. Once
                    cleared, I think the Egyptians did very well in running it. In addition to
                    hiring American companies to dredge the Canal, the Authority hired three or four
                    American pilots who brought the convoys through and trained Egyptian pilots. I
                    had good relations with Colonel Mahmoud Younes, managing director of the Suez
                    Canal Authority. I kept in touch with him, during which he discussed plans for
                    developing the Canal. One of the best reports I wrote during my career was “A
                    Socioeconomic Survey of Port Said” (May 1961), which dealt with what was
                    happening and future possibilities for the Canal. I got kudos from the
                    Department for the 29 page document. Since those days they seemed to have no
                    problems in running the Canal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Israelis at all a problem while you were dealing

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Israelis weren't a problem for me certainly. Sometimes in that 1959-1961
                    timespan, I would go to Cairo periodically to consult. Once when I was going to
                    Cairo and I passed miles and miles of tanks and army trucks filled with
                    soldiers, sometimes guns, headed toward the Suez Canal. I immediately went to
                    the military attach�s in the embassy and said, “Do you know that this is going
                    on?” Yes, they knew. Nasser at that time had had some sort of disagreement with
                    the Israelis. So he was throwing all this equipment into the Sinai. It went on
                    for about a month. It was a month before “Time Magazine” picked it up. It amazed
                    me that nobody was writing about this. Of course, I prepared reports when I got
                    back to the consulate. So, the 1967 business might have happened earlier if
                    Nasser had gone through with an invasion then, but he didn't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there little probes, small unit actions going along
                        betweethe Israelis and the Egyptians? Was it pretty quiet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It was pretty quiet. I made a trip to the Gaza Strip one time. I was
                    using a map that I found was out of date. I found that the Egyptians had built
                    roads that weren't on the map and these roads were leading to the Gaza Strip.
                    Nasser was given to making acrimonious statements about “imperialists.” He
                    always condemned the Israelis, the U.S. and Britain during his speeches in that
                    period. Sometimes he would add Jordan, too, if King Hussein had made some
                    statement he didn't like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there very much the feeling both while you were in
                        Cairo and in Port Said that Nasser was almost a larger than life figure in
                        the Arab world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. That was the thing. He would come to Port Said to celebrate this
                    so-called “victory,” which wasn't really a victory, on the anniversary of the
                    seizure of the Canal. When he came, the population turned out en masse. At one
                    time, I really feared for his life. The crowd was overwhelming the open car that
                    he was in. I said, “Oh, my God. They're going to kill the man.” They were
                    jumping in and wanted to shake his hands virtually lying on top of him. The
                    people outwardly, I think, favored him. Years later when I went back to Egypt,
                    some of the local employees at the embassy said, “Well, he really was a dictator
                    and we didn't like him, but what could we do?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about contacts in Port Said? Did you find it was sort
                        of different ballgame than in Cairo or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: In Cairo, I had contacts with the various ministries and particularly
                    with tour agencies and businesses. In Port Said, on the other hand, I cultivated
                    as much as I could the governor and chief of police. I always had good relations
                    with the governor. In Port Said, we had a USIS theater. It was large enough to
                    hold maybe 25-30 people. We had a program of special days at USIS to attract
                    children, including Mary's providing cookies. I would also give speeches and
                    sometimes the governor would come to those speeches. So I always had good
                    official contacts. When these “Valiant Faith” sailors were running in the
                    streets, I had more discussions with the police than any other time. My contacts
                    in Port Said other than the government were primarily business officials. Some
                    of the British were still there doing business, so if I gave a party and invited
                    businessmen, there were going to be British there, knowing that some of the
                    locals didn't show up but some did. But they always wanted an invitation. People
                    weren't coming and I was marking them off my list, but my deputy said, “Well,
                    they want the invitation just to say they have it.” So I spent a lot more on
                    printing costs and invited twice as many people as came simply just so they
                    could say, “Oh, yes. I got an invitation from the consul, but I'm busy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there papers that came out of Port Said? Was there a
                        locapress or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, there was a local press, but it didn't have the influence of Cairo.
                    The local press in Arabic maybe had some influence, but I wasn't able to read
                    that well enough. Even though I had studied Arabic, I just was not that good at
                    it. I read the local French language paper. I was a friend of a reporter who
                    worked on the paper. Unfortunately, he was a suspect because he had a French
                    background. His mother or father was French. When it came to the British
                    invading, he left on a British ship. That really ended his career in Port Said
                    as a reporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you cover Sinai and the Gaza Strip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. The Sinai was part of my consular district and there were Canadian
                    UN peacekeepers near Gaza. That is the reason that I made this trip to the Gaza
                    Strip. I did have contact regularly with the Canadians. One of them gave my son
                    a little white military jeep as a toy. One of the things I wanted to do was go
                    to Mount Sinai where the Ten Commandments were supposedly formulated. I had it
                    all worked out, and then the government would not approve my going there. I
                    raised the question, “Why?” They said, “Russians from the Russian embassy have
                    gone up there, and they've passed out leaflets to people on the way up and
                    back.” I said, “Well, I'm not going to pass out leaflets.” Nevertheless, they
                    had made the rule that no diplomats could go to Mount Sinai, so I never did see
                    that historic mountain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Gaza? What was the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: When I got up there, they had a lot of Palestinian refugees. I was there
                    twice. I was there on my own for the first time; the second time, FSI Arabic
                    language students made a tour of the Middle East out of Beirut. I was in Gaza
                    with this group. In my talking to the refugees, they were, of course,
                    complaining that the Israelis had stolen their land and they had no place to go.
                    Unfortunately, on the second trip with the group, the head of the group said,
                    “Well, actually, there are worse slums and worse situations elsewhere.” This did
                    not create a good impression! My trips were intended to gather information,
                    including checking the military attach�'s map. I really had no regular reporting
                    from there. It was just impressions and stories. Some of the people in the Gaza
                    Strip later became the militants inside Beirut particularly. The interesting
                    thing was that from Gaza Strip, I could look up on the hill and see Israeli
                    cities. Then when I got to Israel on a trip, I could look down on the Gaza Strip
                    from the other side. There was no mixing or border crossing in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with our people in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. On an earlier trip with my Arabic class, we visited Israel. There I
                    heard their side of the story, but I had no direct contact as far as work was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1961. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I came back to the United States. I was assigned as head othe Basic
                    Officer's Course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from 1961 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: 1961-1963, about two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Basic Course was called “A-100.” How did that name
                        comabout?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: I don't know why the “100” is”A.” Perhaps it stood for “Administration.”
                    I was assigned because I had worked toward a Ph.D. in college and the job was
                    called “college professor.” I must say that, there again, when I was assigned, I
                    was a little disappointed. I was still aiming toward economic work. But it was
                    one of the most important steps in my career development. I might stop at this
                    point and say that while I was wanting my own assignment desire. I realize now
                    that with each step up, I was getting nearer to being qualified for managing an
                    operation, whether it be consular work or economic work or whatever. Getting
                    back to the Basic Officer's Course, I think I was selected because of my
                    academic background as well as my previous experience. At first, we had
                    relatively small classes, maybe 20, but after a while, it got to be over 30 and
                    sometimes as many as 40. They needed two of us to work on it. Duffield was
                    brought in as a codirector. Toward the end, when I was seeking reassignment a
                    couple of years later, they brought in an officer who outranked me. So it was
                    time to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The entry course, the preparation of new officers for the
                        Foreign Service, is a very important one. Do you think the Department of
                        State took it very seriously?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, I think so. You understand that each course director sets up his or
                    her own agenda. I tried to make it as practical as possible. In other words,
                    there were sessions where we talked about reporting and sessions where we talked
                    about getting sailors out of trouble. The things I tried to instill was 1) learn
                    to make decisions and 2) assume responsibility for whatever you're doing. Re
                    this business of decisions: One of the classes for some reason, in all of these
                    big classes, only had about 14 people in it. I thought, “Oh, let's go for the
                    Secretary.” I would have assistant secretaries, former ambassadors, and
                    specialists come to talk to the class. Because of the size of the class, they
                    came to FSI. But here was a class small enough that we might arrange for
                    Secretary Rusk to talk to them. I posed the idea. Of course, his aides
                    immediately arranged it. At a certain date, we were over there. We sat around in
                    his conference room at a big long table along with him. During the discussion he
                    gave me an idea that I hadn't thought of. He was talking about the burden of all
                    of the mail and telegrams that go out, 1,000 telegrams a day, and then hundreds
                    of bags of mail. He made the point that he couldn't possibly read but only a
                    small portion of this correspondence. He had to rely on officers to make the
                    decisions at various levels. In the midst of his emphasizing the need to make
                    decisions, he said, “No decision is a decision.” I hadn't thought of that. What
                    he was saying is, if you don't make a decision at the end of the day, you've
                    decided to wait until tomorrow. He gave a very good story on that. During World
                    War II, he was political advisor to General Stilwell. In 1943 or 1944 when
                    things were going our way, Rusk, along with a lot of other people, reasoned that
                    we were going to win the war. What should the U.S. do afterwards? Stilwell told
                    him to draw up a paper, which he did, recommending certain actions in Indochina,
                    what the U.S. should do. He said that Stilwell sent in the question; no answer.
                    He talked to all the military and civilian high ranking people who came: “Has
                    the President seen this paper?” Finally, he pushed Stilwell again to follow up.
                    “Where is the answer to this proposal?” He went in to Stilwell and said, “Do you
                    have an answer?” He very graphically described how Stilwell went to the wall
                    safe, turned the dial, and took out a piece of a paper and handed it to Rusk. It
                    was the same paper that he had sent in, but at the bottom, it said, “I do not
                    want to hear any more about Indochina - Franklin D. Roosevelt.” Rusk said,
                    because the President did not make a decision at that time about what to do with
                    Indochina, that was one of the things which had led to the situation existing
                    when we were talking - namely, Vietnam and the problems in Vietnam. He used that
                    to illustrate that no decision in 1944 led to the necessity for a lot of
                    decisions at the time we were talking. In the Basic Officer's Course, both
                    Duffield and I tried to make it as practical as possible by bringing over to FSI
                    people to talk about problems in planning. One of the things we learned from
                    these people talking - and even Rusk said that - was that you can draw up all
                    sorts of plans, but they will not cover every contingency. That was the point he
                    was making: you've got to make decisions within plans. I find that that talk
                    gave me a hold on the whole management of foreign affairs, which if I didn't
                    fully realize before, I certainly knew afterwards.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>The people who came through the course were really very select individuals. At
                    one time, I had an officer above me called a “Basic Foreign Service Officer
                    Specialist.” He was higher rank and he was over in the main State building. I
                    went to him and said, “Look, you don't have very many minorities. You don't even
                    have very many women in these classes.” He said, “Well, we would take them, but
                    they don't score high enough on the exam to get in.” So, that was the only thing
                    during that period that I was critical of, that we needed more women, more
                    “colored,” oriental, Latins in the class. I can't recall one black person going
                    through this course when I was in charge there. That later changed, of course,
                    as you well know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at the time about the rule that if a
                        woman got married, she had to resign? From what I gather, when I came in in
                        1955, there was one officer, San Wee, of Chinese descent. I think there were
                        about 20 of us. The rest of us were all males. I understand that a number of
                        the women who came through would end up by getting married even before they
                        went out, often to a Foreign Service officer, which was great for breeding
                        purposes - two very bright people. Was there concern about the fact that the
                        women had to resign when they got married and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. Early, when I started working for the State Department in HICOG,
                    that was one of the things that bugged me. If a male State Department employee
                    wanted to marry a foreigner, usually a German in this case, he had to hand in
                    his resignation until his fianc� was cleared. If she were cleared, they would
                    return the resignation. If they found some problem in her background, they would
                    accept the resignation. Admittedly, some women in the tough months right after
                    the war, did engage in certain activities that weren't acceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually prostitution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. When I was consul in Cardiff, there was a big U.S. military
                    establishment in the north part of my jurisdiction and we had the same thing of
                    the Department having to approve visas for the prospective bride.</p>
                <p>The other thing was, as you mentioned, pregnancy. I presume you mean action when
                    a Foreign Service woman was married to a Foreign Service man or somebody else
                    and she got pregnant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, not just pregnant. In those days, 1961-1963, if a
                        female Foreign Service officer got married, no matter to whom - to another
                        Foreign Service officer, which often happened - she had to resign. That was
                        rather discouraging, I would think, to the recruiters and the trainers, that
                        would think, “Here we've gone to a great deal of trouble to produce a
                        candidate who was being trained. Now she is going to be lost to the
                        Service.”</hi>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. Cleo Noel, who was assassinated in the Sudan. His wife was a Foreign
                    Service officer. They're an example of a couple that developed out of Foreign
                    Service officer training. Of course, she quit when she got married. The same was
                    true for a good many female FSOs. In the classes that I had, there were a few
                    that got married right after the class, maybe two or three. Yes, there were
                    questions of discrimination raised about this procedure, but they weren't very
                    loud at that particular time. Now, of course, the whole assignment process has
                    changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems in getting interesting
                        presentations? One of the complaints I've heard over the years (I suffered
                        through this way back.) was that often you'd get people from the Department
                        or other departments would come in and say “This is what we do” and not
                        being very lively. It wasn't very inspiring.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: When our choices made their first presentation, we didn't know how they
                    were going to be. But if we found somebody who came before our class was like
                    what you're talking about, we would get somebody else to come the next time. We
                    did try to get desk officers who were good speakers. Even some of the
                    ex-ambassadors were the type you were talking about. They were rather boring,
                    but they were ambassadors. I can remember one ambassador who was worried because
                    the students hadn't presented any questions to him. Of course, I urged the class
                    to raise questions, but they often didn't. He was very disturbed when he left.
                    Yes, we tried to make it practical and as interesting as possible. That is why I
                    arranged for Dean Rusk to talk to the group. I'm sorry that he couldn't have
                    talked to all of them, but it just wasn't possible. But there were certain
                    ambassadors or certain assistant secretaries who were very good at explaining
                    policy and planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the complaints that we had - and I've heard it
                        reflected other times - was that when we went over to the Department of
                        Commerce, that was always the deadliest of times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: We didn't go to the Department of Commerce. We took the classes to New
                    York instead. Sometimes we first took them to Philadelphia or Baltimore and then
                    New York to have business people, including bankers, talk to them. Up in New
                    York, Immigration officials also spoke with them, as did our officers at USUN.
                    So we did have field trips, and we tried to get interesting people. But what
                    you're saying is that some of these people from other agencies didn't prove as
                    interesting. We may not have succeeded 100%, but we tried.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I think we did a pretty good job. I was a consultant after I retired. I was down
                    in Mexico City at the same time that a State Department inspection was going on.
                    When I was introduced to one of the female inspectors, she said, “Oh, I know
                    you. You wrote the best evaluations I've seen for the FSI basic course.” These
                    things surface later. Both Duffield and I really tried to write analytical and
                    thoughtful evaluations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duffield's first name was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Thomas Jefferson Duffield. He's dead now. He had been consul in Portugal
                    and in Brazil. I don't know what the rest of his career was. In any event, the
                    two of us worked well together. As a matter of fact, Ms. McMillan used to work
                    with us. She was our special administrative assistant who arranged classes and
                    called people for appointments. I was surprised to find she was still working
                    with A-100 after all these years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you making a mental list as these groups of officers
                        came bof which ones you saw as moving towards the top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. Each class, I tried to pick out who I thought were the leaders of
                    the class. Well, some of them, like Winston Lord, Peter DeVoss, Richard
                    Holbooke, and other people you'd recognize. Some of them whom I considered
                    leaders left the Foreign Service. The name of Featherstone comes to mind. He was
                    tops in my mind. He resigned after a few years. He said that he didn't feel his
                    skills and knowledge were being effectively used. One of the things was, of
                    course, many students didn't like assignments to consular or administrative
                    work. So, Featherstone is an example of an officer who had a good background. He
                    did very well in the class discussions. But after a few years, he gave it up and
                    went back to private industry. I think he was a lawyer. I was sad when I heard
                    that he had resigned. I had a chance to talk to him when he was on his way out.
                    By then, it was too late to get him to change his mind. I had occasion this past
                    week to read something that another Foreign Service officer loaned to me - a man
                    by the name of James Hallway. In 1963, he submitted a resignation to the
                    Secretary. It was in the Newsletter. He was bringing out just what I've been
                    talking about, that he did not feel he was recognized for his talents. At that
                    time, there were eight grades, and he had come in and was only a seven after
                    five years of service. He couldn't understand why he hadn't gotten promoted. He
                    just felt that he wasn't being fully utilized and said he was sorry to leave. He
                    wanted to serve his country, but it just wasn't giving him a career that he
                    thought he would like to have.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Well, there was criticism in cases like mine, where I came in at a class four,
                    which was halfway up the scale. At that time - the Wristonization (I came under
                    Section 517 conversion), the people that were in the regular Foreign Service
                    didn't like that. I could appreciate it. If I had been there having gone through
                    the difficult written exam, I might have felt the same way. My only reply is
                    that before entering the Foreign Service I had had several years of professional
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with Personnel to try to tailor the first
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, I didn't have much to do with that. Near the end of a given class,
                    somebody would come over from Personnel Placement and would read where they were
                    sending various people. Some of them were staying in Washington. Some of them
                    were going into other courses. But I can remember one woman who cried. She had
                    been assigned as a vice consul in Bermuda, and she wanted to go to Africa. She
                    cried that she didn't get an assignment to Africa as she had requested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Africa was a big thing then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. Africa was a big drawing card in the 1960s, with many new countries
                    becoming independent. If they were put in consular or administrative work, most
                    of the students really were not happy. It seemed as if they all wanted to be
                    political officers or, at the least, economic officers. Duffield and I both kept
                    emphasizing to them, “You're not all going to be ambassadors, but you aim in
                    that direction and otherwise be satisfied with a career.” It was interesting,
                    the reaction to some of the assignments. I can't remember what Winston Lord got,
                    but he seemed satisfied. I had known his mother before him, as a matter of fact.
                    She was UN representative, and I had met her in Egypt on a visit, at a desert
                    tent party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had an extensive set of interviews with Winston
                        Lord.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I would have thought, during 1961-1963, these, of course, were President
                    Kennedy's years. This was the height of inspiration to serve your country. There
                    was a great spirit of “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you
                    can do for your country.” Were you feeling this?</p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This wasn't just a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: No, no. These young people really came in wanting to make a contribution.
                    That is why they thought, if they were doing consular work, they weren't making
                    a contribution. I kept emphasizing that, “Look, someday, some of you will be
                    ambassadors and you'll be glad you did consular or administrative work as well
                    as other types of work.” In my own case, by the time I was a DCM, I could
                    perform any office job in the embassy when section heads went on leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. I've had many retired ambassador interviewees
                        make that same point, how much they got out of administrative or consular
                        assignments and how it was an important tool when they later had more
                        responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In 1963, what did you do?</p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I was desk officer for South Asia. I had come into the Basic Officer's
                    Course in 1961. In 1963, I became post management officer for South Asia. That
                    was the first time I realized my various assignments had paid off. I knew how a
                    post operated. I knew how a consulate operated. In those days, for example, they
                    were changing the Pakistani capital to Islamabad from Karachi. I spent a lot of
                    time helping organize that project. It was also a time when I learned things
                    that I would not ordinarily have learned. Each year, around budget time, we were
                    supposed to put down the various vacancies that we, the management officers,
                    felt should be allotted to specific posts, that they needed a new consul or a
                    new assistant GSO or something. So we put them on the list. Then my boss at one
                    point said, “You know, if these are approved, it doesn't necessarily mean you're
                    going to get them. We'll use them wherever we think we should have them.” I
                    thought, “Well, what's the use of my doing all this for my post and then I don
                    't get them at the end?” That was somebody else's decision rather than mine.
                    These are the little things you learn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you were on the South Asia desk, what
                        countries dithat comprise at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Burma, and Sri Lanka.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It was really not a full two years. I moved to the desk because 1) I had
                    spent approximately two years on the Basic Officer's Course and 2) I was
                    outranked by Duffield's successor. I wasn't hard-nosed about it, but I
                    considered that I might as well move on to something else. So, in 1963, I moved
                    over to the South Asia desk job. In 1964, which I'll mention later, I was sent
                    to Manila.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: There was a lot of work concerning India. Chester Bowles waambassador for

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Well, Galbraith, if he decided he wanted to go someplace, he'd just order
                    the Air attach� to fly him there. After all, it was a subcontinent. The
                    Pentagon, however, was pressuring us to pay for use of the plane. But by the
                    time Bowles came to be briefed, in the meeting I pointed out that a lot of money
                    was going for these trips. He said, “Don't worry, I'll talk to the Pentagon.” I
                    left, so I don't know whether he was able to get the Pentagon to approve use
                    without payment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the desk officer, did you find that you were getting
                        reports that were coming from our ambassador in India, Chester Bowles, and
                        then our ambassador in Pakistan? Often, the two countries were at
                        loggerheads. Each ambassador had absorbed the country in which he was
                        working's point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. I wasn't on the political desk. I was on the management desk, so I
                    didn't enter much into these possible conflicts. I might hear conversations at
                    staff meetings, but nothing with which I was directly concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular problems in any of these

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Not particularly. The amount of counterpart funds we had in India was
                    almost enough to buy the country. We were attempting to use it up by buying
                    furniture for other posts in India. We even bought airline tickets for other
                    locations with Indian counterpart funds. I suppose USAID also made use of it.
                    One of the problems for me personally was it was a bad budget year for the
                    Department, so I was not able to visit any of my posts. Only later, as a
                    consultant, did I visit them. Offhand, I cannot think of any great problems
                    other than day to day management. Obviously, all posts were bucking for
                    additional positions or funds.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: The story that I've been leading up to has come to a point. While I was
                    post management officer, I still kept trying to get an economic assignment. It
                    irritated me. They would say, “Why don't you go down and talk to So and So
                    Bureau or Such and Such place? Maybe they might have an economic job.” Well, why
                    should I have to look for an assignment in economics? If they knew what was
                    available, why wasn't I considered? The reason I felt I was qualified to do
                    economic work was because, even though I had only one economic course in
                    college, I had taken special night courses in advanced economics and money and
                    banking. I had taken a foreign trade and labor relations course. I took the War
                    College correspondence course, which was heavy on economic planning. Anyway,
                    Cleo Noel was a very good friend of mine. He was in Personnel Placement at that
                    time. He called me one day and asked would I take an assignment in Karachi where
                    I would have been the deputy to the consul general and at the same time do
                    economic reporting. I said, “Well, I'll talk to Mary about it and let you know
                    tomorrow.” So, I went back and said, “Yes, I'll take it.” I had hardly returned
                    to my office when he was walking in the door. He said, “We want you instead to
                    go to Manila as deputy economic counselor.” Here within 24 hours, two economic
                    assignments were dropped in my lap. I did go to Manila. The reason was that
                    Maurice Taylor, a financial expert, was economic counselor. He had home leave
                    lined up. His deputy was not on the promotion list and retired on the spot. He
                    said, “You get somebody here by the time I go on leave.” That was about a month.
                    I fell right into the gap. I had only been there about two or three weeks when
                    he took off, and I ran the place until he came back. Shortly after he came back,
                    things blew up in the Dominican Republic, and they needed a financial expert.
                    They pulled him out. The Department said, “Beaman can run it on an acting basis
                    until we find somebody.” Well, it was 10 months before Donald Calder came in to
                    replace Taylor. Calder was there a couple of months and he had a heart attack.
                    So, again, I was acting for another two or three months. He didn't get
                    evacuated. He recuperated at home. That's the reason why, from 1964-1967, I was
                    really getting my economic experience. It was at a crucial time. We were
                    negotiating a trade treaty that was going to run out in a few years - and what
                    could come after? There were airline rights that had to be negotiated. So, all
                    in all, it was a good experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1964, what was the Philippine government like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: Diosdado Macapagal was president at the time. The embassy in general had
                    good relations with the president. The Philippines had a lot of economic
                    problems, and there was a big AID operation attached to the embassy. I used to
                    go on field trips with the AID director to various places. Came an election and
                    Macapagal was replaced by Ferdinand Marcos. When Marcos was elected, the embassy
                    was a little bit shocked because they had not had very many contacts with
                    Marcos. The consul general, an officer by the name of Gleek, had the most
                    contacts with Marcos. So we officers were all called to go to parties in order
                    to get acquainted with the new incoming president. I can remember, I was talking
                    to Mrs. Marcos for, I guess, too long a time, and my wife came up and said,
                    “Somebody else wants to talk to her.” In other words, “Get away and let somebody
                    else talk.” In any event, as a result of this, the Marcos camp gave a lot of
                    parties to which Americans were invited. So we did get well acquainted with
                    Marcos.</p>
                <p>At that time, the embassy regarded Marcos as the “Great White Hope,” if you want
                    to use that phrase. He came in speaking a lot like Amos in the Bible, saying,
                    “You have been corrupt. You've been doing such and such and it's got to stop.
                    We're going to do such and such.” It was an amazing inaugural address, at least
                    to me. But there was a lot of corruption. It didn't start under Marcos. It had
                    started long before that. It was rather benign until after Marcos came into
                    power. In later years, he and Mrs. Marcos became like other politicians. I
                    wasn't there when corruption seized the Marcos. I would say that all the time I
                    was there, the relations were pretty good with the Filipinos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Economic Section keeping an eye on corruption or
                        was thimore political?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It was more political. We might be on the periphery of something, but our
                    task was primarily promoting trade. We had an Economic Section that had seven
                    officers and a showroom. It was a big operation. During my period, we did have
                    talks on airline rights. Further on, one of the things that I spent a lot of my
                    time on was trying to get the Filipinos to join in a satellite project. In
                    addition to being deputy economic counselor, I was also the science attach�. A
                    lot of officials from Washington having to do with satellites came quite often.
                    I would go over to the foreign ministry with them for talks. What they wanted
                    the Filipinos to do was to build a receiving station. These satellites were
                    going to be like beads around the Earth and they wanted to be able to beam
                    something from Washington to the Philippines. Just before I left, I went out
                    into a field where there was a temporary receiving and sending station.
                    President Marcos came and talked to President Johnson via satellite. So I
                    figured, at least I had accomplished something while I was there. I had good
                    relations with the Atomic Energy Commission and other groups concerned with
                    these matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the emphasis? I would have thought that, one, we
                        would have been doing everything we could to encourage the Philippines to
                        develop its own industrial base and to turn it into a viable country because
                        we had this implicit responsibility, but at the same time, we're always
                        trying to find markets. How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: We were trying to push both industrial and agricultural development.
                    There were a number of American companies operating there. Many of our contacts
                    were with them. We were trying to push trade, for one thing, and then there was
                    the AID operation which was trying to help the Philippines, particularly to
                    develop agriculture. The agricultural attach� did a good job of introducing the
                    Filipinos to “bulgur wheat” as a supplement to a rice diet. At that time, there
                    was a communist rebellion in rural provinces north of Manila. Our main thrust as
                    far as public relations were concerned: 1) serving with the political counselor
                    or the AID director on negotiations for help. I didn't have anything to do with
                    getting any money to them. It was the AID people. But I would go with the AID
                    director sometimes, and then I'd go with the political counselor 2) Ambassador
                    Blair when he came wanted to visit every province in the Philippines. He again,
                    like in India, used the Air attach�'s plane. He would select officers to go
                    along. I didn't go on every trip, but I went on many trips with him where we
                    would go to a given province and talk to political and economic people.</p>
                <p>Another thing as far as embassy-government relations were concerned related to
                    the military bases. We probably (not me personally) had more difficulty with
                    incidents that happened at these bases. Filipino thieves would steal yards and
                    yards of cable wire right out of the ground. One time, somebody threw a small
                    bomb over the fence of the air base. Somehow, our USIS people put out something
                    that inferred that the Filipinos had done this. Obviously, they were probably
                    Filipinos. So, that created a little flurry. Then there were the usual problems
                    of sailors and soldiers getting into trouble with the locals.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the major export of the Philippines in those

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Sugar. The Laurel-Langley Agreement had sugar quotas as one of its main
                    provisions. Before that time and even during that time, we were buying a lot of
                    sugar from Cuba. When Cuba went communist, Philippine sugar became more
                    important. There were other things, but that was the main thing we discussed
                    with the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, that was a very controlled thing. You could only
                        bring so much in. It really wasn't much of a looking for a market type
                        thing, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. The thing was that the Filipinos wanted a long-term agreement. The
                    Laurel-Langley Agreement was going to run out about eight years after I left.
                    They were trying to get a bigger quota on sugar. There were discussions on that
                    and also what to do with the Laurel-Langley Agreement after it expired. I think
                    after I left, the U.S. got it extended a few more years, but I'm not sure.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Oh, yes. In the stores, they liked American products, particularly
                    records and music tapes. That was for the younger crowd, but there were other
                    U.S. things - dresses, blue jeans, household equipment, especially air
                    conditioners - that were sold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we having any problem with pirating, intellectual

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, that was a problem in the Philippines, particularly in music tapes.
                    Taiwan was the worst offender with respect to books. We kept an eye on the
                    problem in the Philippines also, but there wasn't that much pirating. They
                    didn't have much of a publishing industry. Taiwan did more pirating in books as
                    well as music tapes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get many visitors for trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. The governor of Illinois brought the biggest trade delegation. There
                    were a few trade delegations like that which came through to talk business. We
                    had also individual businessmen and smaller groups visiting. Our commercial
                    attach� worked with such groups. We also had a small showroom featuring smaller
                    American products. Exhibits were changed from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How solid did you feel the economy and the handling of
                        theconomy was at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: There, I had some doubts. There was corruption. Even though Marcos made
                    this wonderful speech that he was going to stamp it out, there was not only
                    corruption, but they would kill one another. Many carried guns. They would stick
                    them in their belt behind their barongs. It's worse in the U.S. now than it was
                    then, but, in any event, there was regular violence and robbery. I felt the
                    Filipinos weren't having a good development. There were still a lot of poor
                    people. It was most obvious around the U.S. air base. Outside the air base was a
                    large pocket of poverty. You've seen pictures of shacks along the railroad. I
                    felt that the rich were doing better in the Philippines than the rest of the
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern about the embassy, particularly the
                        officer staff, being almost absorbed by the wealthy Filipinos. Their
                        hospitality is well-known, but also, it's a hospitality with a hook. In
                        other words, there is often a reason behind it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I don't think we purposely cultivated only the wealthy. We were trying to
                    maintain high contacts with the government. Of course, there were a number of
                    parties put on by Philippine organizations. For example, whenever the Atomic
                    Energy Commission had a dinner, I was always invited. We certainly concentrated
                    on contacts with the government and business people. In our daily lives we had
                    contacts with ordinary people who were largely friendly and liked Americans.
                    However, as you were saying, did we get down to the poor? No, I don't think we
                    did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Certainly, I think everybody was trying to cultivate as many Filipinos as
                    they could. They were very friendly. There is no question about it. Most of the
                    social functions had, from our standpoint, an aim of trying to cultivate
                    friends. Some of the invitees were middle class. For example, there were
                    teachers, journalists, and small businessmen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. The consulate got that. I don't recall anything along that line. When
                    I was science attach�, some of the conferences got a little dicey. I can
                    remember one instance where a fellow who was big, fat. He was chosen to go to
                    some conference on an airplane, and we were paying for it. He wanted us to pay
                    for two first class seats because he was so big. Well, we ended up doing it, but
                    it was things like that that were petty really.</p>

                    in Damascus. I left Manila and went directly to Damascus. I was due home leave
                    and was a little concerned that I wasn't going to get it. I didn't get it for
                    another year. In other words, it was three years that I was overseas, rather
                    than two. But I had been selected as DCM. It was a step up based, I think, on
                    various jobs that I had had for a while.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: The day I arrived, the merchants were pulling down the shutters because
                    the Army was angry. Somebody had printed an article (I forget whether it was in
                    an Army journal or what) that said that God was dead. Of course, to the Muslims,
                    this was anathema. There was public agitation about this statement. I arrived
                    just at the time that all this was going on. I think what you're talking about
                    was Syrian relations with the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think “Time Magazine” - this was one of these debates
                        that was going on, the challenging and all. “Is God Dead” or something that
                        was on the front cover of “Time.”</hi>

                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. I arrived and the ambassador received me at the residence. It was a
                    Sunday. He said that he had taken a long time to select me. He had gone through
                    several files. I guess that was supposed to make me feel good. I was thrown
                    immediately into a lot of problems. We could see war was shaping up, even from
                    the time I arrived. There was probably going to be an outbreak of war with
                    Israel. This soon happened, of course. This was in 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Smythe's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: He was an economic specialist with the USUN in New York. I did not
                    personally meet him there. I was in the audience when he gave a talk to our
                    Basic Officers Course. He always claimed he was regular Foreign Service. He
                    wasn't, but it did not matter. He was an ambassador. His wife was a nationally
                    renown special educator. I was told President Johnson offered her an
                    ambassadorial appointment. She declined, saying, “Appoint my husband instead.”
                    What was the Department to do? It appointed him. Why he took so long to select
                    him another DCM I don't know. Like in Port Said earlier, the job had been long
                    vacant. In fact, I was in Manila, and the former DCM, Hugh Appling, was actually
                    assigned to Manila before I left. I had a chance to talk to him. He warned me
                    that Ambassador Smythe would be demanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that relations between the staff and Smythe
                        weren'very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Now that you have brought it up, I guess I can talk. I was going to deal
                    with Damascus without mentioning his name. I am convinced that even in Damascus
                    he was suffering from cancer (He died of cancer a few years after he retired in
                    1969). One illustration of this was given by the Syrian foreign minister who was
                    a former doctor. At the height of developing troubles, when President Johnson
                    was sending telegrams urging everybody to stay calm, let's not have a war out of
                    this, we had to deliver this message to the foreign ministry. While the
                    ambassador was reading it, the foreign minister kept looking at him. After he
                    had finished, the foreign minister asked, “May I touch you?” This was unusual.
                    He walked over and felt the ambassador's neck under his chin and ears, and told
                    the ambassador, “You ought to get that looked into.” The ambassador apparently
                    knew what he was talking about, that it might be cancer. He said, “Oh, yes. I'll
                    have it taken care of.” The foreign minister went back, sat down, and then
                    answered the demarche.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>In Damascus, the one big problem was that Ambassador Smythe did not want to
                    evacuate. Everybody else, Americans in other Arab countries, were sending their
                    dependents out. Ambassador Smythe didn't want to do it. Finally, the rest of the
                    staff came to me and said, “We want to send our dependents out.” We went in to
                    the ambassador, all the officers, and said, “It's time to send them out.” Well,
                    the ambassador angrily dressed us down: “You people tell your wives things, and
                    they get excited” and this, that, and the other. But at the end, he gave a nod
                    to start what I called an echelon evacuation of dependents. I did not want to
                    send my wife and children out first. I did not want the ambassador's wife to be
                    sent first. I wanted the small children and younger wives to go first. We had to
                    get approval from the foreign office to leave Syria. So we started sending them
                    over to Beirut, the younger families first, and then working up. The day the war
                    started, my wife and children and the ambassador's wife were going right toward
                    the area where, supposedly, the Israelis were or would be rolling over the
                    border. They were delayed a little because Mrs. Smythe sent her driver to go get
                    some jewelry she had ordered in the souk. They did, and they somehow came back
                    to the embassy. The ambassador looked out the window and saw them. He rushed
                    out, shouting, “Get out of here! There is a war going on!” I worried until
                    evening when I could get in touch with my wife by telephone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They got to Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: They got to Beirut, yes. The next day, they and other American evacuees
                    from several Middle East posts were taken to the airfield where PanAm chartered
                    planes were waiting. There was no indication as to where each was going. My
                    family was flown to Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it known that a war was going to start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: There were several things. One was the usual criticism by Syrians and
                    other Arab countries by radio, of Israel and the U.S. helping them. I think the
                    Israelis went into Jordan first. Syria had broken diplomatic relations with
                    Jordan, of all countries, because a Syrian man and woman were going across the
                    border into Jordan presumably to assassinate King Hussein. The customs officials
                    were examining the car when it exploded and killed a customs official. Of
                    course, these people were immediately taken into Jordanian custody and
                    questioned at length. So Syria because their people had been taken into custody,
                    broke diplomatic relations with Jordan at a time when the war was imminent. It
                    was primarily the acrimonious condemnation on radios that caused us to think war
                    was coming. I was down in the souk one day, and I saw soldiers buying cardboard
                    suitcases, a lot of them. What's this about? I immediately went to the embassy
                    to put that on the record to add to a list of other indicators. Bob Paganelli
                    was the second ranking political officer in those days. He later became
                    ambassador to Qatar. He spoke Arabic well and kept phoning government officials
                    to assure safety of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And later ambassador to Syria, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. He was an excellent ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Reagan administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. In Damascus, we started getting messages from Washington saying:
                    “Talk to the Syrians and try to get them to calm down and also deny that we're
                    helping the Israelis.” There was often bombast by Arab countries, but this time
                    we felt it was serious. There usually was a lot of loud condemnation. This time
                    it was being accompanied by troops mobilizing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also the Israelis did a preemptive strike on Egypt,
                        knocked out the Egyptian air force. This was after the UN had withdrawn its
                        troops at Nasser's request from the Sinai.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the embassy when the war actually
                        started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: First of all, we got our marching orders, so to speak. I was at dinner,
                    so I wasn't at the embassy when the break came. The senior political officer was
                    called over with the ambassador to the foreign ministry. The foreign minister
                    delivered a message that we had 48 hours to get out. Of course, we let
                    Washington know diplomatic relations were broken. By that time, most of the
                    dependents were already on their way. It was only my family and the ambassador's
                    that weren't. Then we started burning papers. I lived on a hill about 100 yards
                    from the embassy, but I had to go down one street and backtrack to get to the
                    embassy. As I turned the corner toward the embassy, there was a big
                    demonstration going on. I rushed down. There was a big Syrian security officer
                    telling our political officer, “We do everything we can to protect you and yet
                    you're letting the Israelis know where you are.” The smoke pipe on top of the
                    embassy was glowing red. They interpreted this as our signaling the Israelis.
                    Before we got out of there, the Israelis did strike at Damascus. I tried to get
                    the female secretaries particularly to go down in the basement, but I couldn't
                    get them to get as far back as possible. A few of us and the Marines were
                    watching this from the top of the embassy. The Israelis came in and the first
                    thing they did - on the hills were anti-aircraft guns and they came in and took
                    out the anti-aircraft. It was right above us. It sounded like they were
                    bombarding the embassy. The next thing they did, on the second run, was take out
                    the oil storage tanks which were east of town. We could see the flames coming
                    up. The third strike that they made was to bomb the airport. They really did a
                    lot of damage, not necessarily on neighborhoods, but in strategic places. Some
                    Syrians were standing on their balconies watching all this.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Meanwhile we were preparing to leave anyway. So, finally, we got everything lined
                    up, and we left from the American school, not the embassy. I was the last one
                    out of the embassy. When I walked away and looked back, the Italian flag was
                    flying over the chancery. We left our administrative officer behind to work with
                    the Italians. When I got to Rome, I worked with the Italians at the other end.
                    Paul Deibel was the one left behind. When he got to Rome, he was a nervous
                    wreck. There had been more bombing after we left.</p>
                <p>In any event, on the evacuation, we were supposed to leave earlier than we did by
                    a half hour or so and the Syrian police escort kept pointing up at the sun in
                    the sky. It was well towards sundown when we got to the border. Our so-called
                    “convoy director” was the economic officer. He refused to turn over the
                    registrations of the embassy vehicles being demanded by the Syrians. So I
                    listened to this and finally went and got the ambassador. I said, “You've got to
                    come and put the convoy director right. The Syrians want the registrations and
                    they won't let us go until they get them.” When the ambassador came in, the
                    Syrian officer stuttered, “Your man is excited.” The ambassador said, “Give it
                    to them.” So we got to Beirut after dark. One of the problems in evacuating was
                    trying to round up Americans. In the convoy, there were a few private Americans.
                    Two of them were teachers at the American school. The American school had been
                    collecting money for the next fall term. When we got on our way, these women
                    suddenly said, “Oh, my Heavens, we left the tuition money in the school!” We
                    could not do anything at that point. Also, somewhere along the line, they lost
                    their air tickets. So we had to arrange to get new air tickets for them and
                    advance them money to get to the States. It showed irresponsibility on their
                    part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about our consulate in Aleppo? Didn't they have
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Oh, yes. That was the worst incident. I had been talking on the phone to
                    Aleppo and one of the wives was saying that the husbands were up in the coderoom
                    destroying documents. There was a big crowd out in front, a demonstration. They
                    were concerned. I said, “Well, I'll arrange to call the foreign office on this
                    immediately.” Before she got of the phone, she said, “Oh, well, the police are
                    coming now.” She could hear the police sirens. So, I didn't think it was urgent,
                    but I told Bob Chase, the senior political officer, and he in turn got in touch
                    with the foreign office. Meanwhile, this mob had gotten into the consulate and
                    had done some destruction. The main thing was what happened to the people. The
                    men burned their hands going down a rope from the code room.</p>
                <p>The mob destroyed things like stored Christmas decorations or looted personal
                    items. But when the consulate reopened years later, bags packed with people's
                    clothing were still sitting in a room. Officers and dependents headed toward
                    Turkey. There was a military attach� who just happened to be there. He had been
                    down in Damascus. He fainted right at the border and hit his head on the fender
                    of the automobile. Of course, they had to take care of him. They finally got
                    over the border, but they had the roughest time.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to finish up this part, you went to Rome
                        initially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes, I went to Rome. The ambassador after a few days went back to the
                    United States, and I stayed in Rome about two weeks. We arranged for the
                    Italians to take over the protecting power responsibility. This really had been
                    arranged before we left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You mentioned that the Italian flag had already gone
                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Actually, the Italian embassy overlooked the garden of our embassy, so it
                    was a really good arrangement. The Department had informed us before we left
                    that the Italians would take the protection. So I went with Deibel and the
                    budget and fiscal officer, and we talked about what needed to be done. For one
                    thing, we had a lot of refrigerators and stoves in storage to issue to people
                    who didn't bring them with them. There was also a USIS building downtown that
                    needed protection. One of the interesting things that I had not known until the
                    last minute was that our political officer lived under a Syrian official. A bug
                    had been put in the walls. They had to work to get that out of there before we
                    left. This must have been a “need to know” act because nobody had told me about
                    it until I wondered what they were doing.We were in Beirut. It was Friday by
                    that time. In the mosques, the mullahs were saying, “Strike at all things
                    British and American.” Several of us were having lunch with a friend of mine,
                    Adrian Middleton, who was the DCM in Beirut. After an aide brought him a
                    message, he said, “Don't even finish your lunch. I think you all ought to get
                    out of here.” So we gathered our personnel and flew out. The budget and fiscal
                    officer had a lot of gold coins with him in a mail bag. I can remember his going
                    up into the airplane - clink, clink, clink, up the steps. The ambassador, when
                    we got in and got settled, was furious because the Russians were evacuating on
                    the same plane. Once we got to Rome, he came back to Washington, and I stayed
                    behind with a few people to make the arrangements. Then I came back to the
                    States also.</p>

                <p>BEAMAN: There is one item on the evacuation I think I should mention. It's an
                    illustration of all the strings that you have to tie together. Before I left
                    Damascus, the ambassador insisted that I be made treasurer of the American
                    school board, which I was. As I told you earlier, in bringing out the teachers,
                    they had left the fees behind. But there was about $3,000 in a bank in New York.
                    So, as soon as I got back to the States, I talked to the desk officer, and he
                    referred me to some educational society in New York that handled matters about
                    overseas schools. I made arrangements with them to take over the fund and
                    administer it until such time as it was needed. I did that, and I gave the
                    papers to the desk officer. But then later when the U.S. opened up diplomatic
                    relations with Syria, I called the desk. I can't remember what year that was. I
                    called the desk and told them about it. They had never heard of the arrangement.
                    I said, “You've got $3,000 there to start your school with.” They took it over
                    from there, I guess. It was just one of those things.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, while I was back in the Department, I spent about four months on the
                    Philippine desk. I had recently been to the Philippines, and Richard Service was
                    in charge of that area. He asked for me to fill in until somebody else came on
                    the job. There were two main things that I did on the desk. One was preparing
                    for President Johnson and Secretary Rusk little paragraphs for their “nightly
                    reading,” as they called it. If we had anything that was important from the
                    Philippines, we'd write up a short paragraph and then attach it with a lot of
                    other paragraphs prepared by other offices.</p>
                <p>But the second thing was that they wanted me to put a price tag on the cost of
                    operations (State Department, AID, other agency) in the Philippines. Somebody in
                    the Latin American Bureau was doing the same on Colombia or Venezuela. We would
                    get together to compare notes on procedures. I spent a lot of my time trying to
                    put an annual price tag on various operations. The only thing was, the other
                    agency wouldn't cooperate.</p>
                <p>I may have mentioned earlier, Ambassador Smythe had asked me to go with him if he
                    were reassigned out. He was assigned to Malta, and he still wanted me to go with
                    him. Tom Kresse was selected as administrative officer, and he also wanted me to
                    be with him, which I did. Tom later retired to Greece.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>There were problems, and I guess I might as well bring them out. As I noted, I
                    feel the ambassador had cancer. I think it was eating at him, and he knew that
                    it was, but whether he ever really got treatment, I don't know. He didn't want
                    to leave his job, I think, to take chemotherapy. In any event, there was this
                    situation that might have accounted for some of the odd things I'm going to talk
                    about. He was an authoritarian type. As I told you earlier, President Johnson
                    wanted to appoint his wife as ambassador. After Ambassador Smythe died, his wife
                    did become ambassador to the Cameroons. But in any event, he got to Malta about
                    a week before I did. I was assigned as DCM. Kresse was administrative officer.
                    So, there were three of us moving in, which constituted half the embassy's U.S.
                    personnel. As soon as I got there, and he had made his call on the prime
                    minister. I asked him, “Have you made arrangements to talk to the leader of the
                    opposition, Mr. Mintoff, after talking to the government officials?” “No.
                    Mintoff is in Australia or someplace.” Well, Mintoff came back from Australia
                    very shortly. By that time, I was in the hospital with a very bad gall bladder
                    affliction. I could have died because it was breaking apart. I was out for about
                    three weeks. When officers would come from the embassy, I would say, “Has the
                    ambassador made arrangements to call on Mr. Mintoff?” No, he hadn't. When I got
                    out of the hospital, this was the first thing and the most important thing that
                    I worked on. It took me six months to get Mintoff and the ambassador to meet and
                    get acquainted with one another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain something about Mintoff? He is the only
                        person from Malta whose name sort of still reverberates down the diplomatic
                        corridor. Could you explain what his background was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: George Borg Olivier was the prime minister. He was the Nationalist Party.
                    Mintoff actually became head of the Labor Party by easing out a man, Anton
                    Buttigieg, who had been a longtime activist. Mintoff's background was Slavic.
                    His family came from someplace in the Balkans. Mintoff was a person who had very
                    strong feelings like the ambassador. That is the reason that they did not get
                    along. Mintoff did not like the Church. That was very obvious in talking to him.
                    There were times that I had big parties, and I invited Mintoff along with George
                    Borg Olivier. The prime minister would come but Mintoff never did. I spoke to
                    Labor people about this and they said, “Oh, don't worry about that. He won't
                    even come to some of our parties. He doesn't like big parties. He thinks it's
                    consuming booze and talking about things that are not important.” He came into
                    power after I left. What I'm saying is building up to that.Anyway, we finally
                    did get them together about June of 1968. I was with him. Mintoff's first
                    comments after the “Hello” type of thing was, “I see you've been visiting a lot
                    of priests.” That was true. Then Mintoff offered a drink. The ambassador said,
                    “Oh, I don't drink.” They ended up drinking milk because Mintoff didn't drink
                    alcohol either. So we did finally get them together, but it resulted in no
                    continuing conversation. The ambassador never tried after that. In fact, he
                    didn't talk much to any Labor Party people. I was the one who handled that, not
                    because he directed me to, but because I decided I had to. Somebody had to talk
                    to the Labor Party. The ambassador was very disturbed that I had not been there
                    the first three weeks of the first month of his assignment. He wanted me there
                    to help him. Later, he complained to the inspectors about this, which I didn't
                    know at the time. I found it out later after he left. Kressie and I and the
                    other officers really tried to lead him along to do appropriate things. He did
                    go on a schedule of visiting every parish in Malta because the parish priests do
                    represent sort of a local government. The national government was a Parliament
                    meeting at night part-time. He always had to have me or the next ranking
                    officer, Harry Glazer, along. Harry or I had to write up these visits, which
                    really were not the kind of material that we ordinarily reported on. We kept
                    making that point to the ambassador, but he kept insisting. Farther down the
                    line after he had left, we stopped. Washington said they didn't want that type
                    of reporting, but they didn't tell him. They waited until he left, and they told
                    me.</p>
                <p>The other early crisis was that he took a dislike to the naval attach� there. He
                    wrote a very harsh letter about Commander Richmond that he wanted me to review.
                    I read it and said, “You shouldn't send this in. This man has a career just like
                    a lot of people. Why don't you just say something to the effect that you feel
                    you could operate better if you had your own choice of a naval attach�?”
                    Whatever he wrote I never knew because he never cleared it with me afterwards.
                    He did get rid of Richmond, and then Commander Freeman came in.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>State Department inspectors came in the summer of 1968, after we had been there
                    about six months. The ambassador had a long list of comments for the inspectors,
                    ranging from not enough light bulbs at the residence to the fact that I was not
                    there at the beginning to help him. He also wanted a white ambassadorial
                    limousine. The Department finally relented and sent one. It stood out from
                    Malta's usually dark cars. A crisis, at least in my mind, occurred about the
                    time the inspectors had finished. The ambassador had been talking to a man who
                    wanted to bring in an American airline (not among the big airlines). Harry
                    Glazer, the economic officer, and I reasoned that this American was sort of a
                    schemer. He talked only to the ambassador, not to Harry, not to me. The Maltese
                    government was not wanting to grant the request. One day the ambassador rushed
                    through the connecting door to my office and said, “Listen in on the phone. I'm
                    going to make a call.” He called the prime minister's secretary, George Borge
                    (The PM was George Borg Olivier; his secretary was George Borg), and the
                    ambassador was pressuring to get approval for this airline. The secretary was
                    saying, “Well, no. The cabinet does not want to approve it.” Then the ambassador
                    said, “The government can go to Hell.” That shocked me through and through. I
                    didn't know what to do. The inspectors were still over at the Hilton Hotel
                    writing their report. I went there and talked to Mr. Freer, who was the chief
                    inspector. He admitted that was very bad, but then said, “What are you going to
                    do about it?” So, I said, “Well, I'm going to Parliament tonight, and I'm going
                    to see George Borg, the prime minister's secretary, and in some way I am going
                    to apologize, saying his outburst was because the ambassador was concerned about
                    various and sundry things, so he lost his temper.” The inspectors felt that
                    might be a good idea. George Borg later said, “Oh, we understand. Don't worry
                    about it.” Nevertheless, I continued to worry about the incident.</p>
                <p>Then the final thing was that he was going to be replaced. Nixon had come in to
                    replace Johnson. So, early in 1969, it was known that Ambassador Smythe would be
                    replaced, but he didn't want to leave. Washington kept on his channel, asking
                    him, “When are you scheduled? We want you to talk to Ambassador Pritzlaff, your
                    successor.” He kept putting it off. In fact, the Malta diplomatic corps wanted
                    to have a party for him, but he told me he didn't want a party or anything. So
                    the Department began calling me on my home phone number and pushing me to get
                    the ambassador on the road. I said, “I can't force him out of here. All I can do
                    is talk.” Anyway, I used every idea I could to find out when he was leaving. He
                    wouldn't set a date. But then the Department said, “Ambassador Pritzlaff is
                    coming” and gave a date. He immediately got transportation documents and left.
                    Since he wasn't going to be seeing the new ambassador, he left several pages of
                    70 numbered paragraphs of things that were wrong. He was alerting the new
                    ambassador. There again, it ranged all the way from not enough light bulbs in
                    the residence to warning him to keep an eye on the British because they were
                    trying to horn in on our trade possibilities. It was sad. He really crept out of
                    town. His diplomatic colleagues wanted to give him a good sendoff, and he didn't
                    want it. They did get to him one day and presented him with a couple of silver
                    cocks, decorative items. There again, one is usually very effusive at a time
                    like that, but he wasn't. He just said, “Thank you” and left. So I was
                    sorry.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>I might mention also that Mrs. Smythe-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mabel Smythe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Yes. As I noted, she was a nationally-known educator in special
                    education. I don't know whether she was full-time in Damascus. I wasn't there
                    long enough. In Malta, she only came at the end of summer when school was out.
                    In between times, he would look to my wife to handle what an ambassador's wife
                    would do, which she did willingly, but in any event, it was even to the point of
                    borrowing salt shakers and tableware from us in order to put on a party.</p>
                <p>John Pritzlaff came and he was a breath of fresh air, you might say. He was
                    willing to listen to recommendations. He had his own ideas, but he was willing
                    to listen. He was a Goldwater Republican, a businessman from Arizona. He had
                    never been in the Foreign Service. One of the interesting things in the first
                    couple of days was that he called me in and said, “You know, I'm the appointed
                    ambassador here. But if you were appointed, what would you do first?” I said,
                    “Well, call on various government officials, starting with the prime minister,
                    and be sure and call on the leader of the opposition.” Even with Ambassador
                    Pritzlaff, it took us a few months to arrange for him to meet Mintoff. He met
                    Mintoff at the latter's farm on the edge of the island where there were swimming
                    facilities. It was in the winter by that time. It was cold. When the ambassador
                    arrived, Mintoff said, “Come on. I'm just going swimming.” The ambassador said,
                    “Well, I didn't bring a swimsuit.” Mr. Mintoff said, “I have plenty.” The
                    ambassador thus went swimming with him, and it was really cold. When he offered
                    the ambassador a drink of brandy, the ambassador told me, “I took it.” He made
                    overtures to Mintoff later a few times, trying to get to talk to him. Mintoff
                    did not respond, at least while I was there.</p>
                <p>Anyway, one of the first things I did was to invite American businessmen and
                    leading Maltese businessmen to my house, so that the ambassador could meet them
                    without having to worry about the party himself. He could just be there and talk
                    to them, which he did. Thereafter, he pursued a good course of periodically
                    dealing with and inviting various businessmen to the residence.</p>
                <p>On my part, under Ambassador Smythe, I started the practice every Wednesday, of
                    having a luncheon for about 12 people. I tried to mix Labor MPs, Nationalist
                    MPs, newspaper people, teachers, and others. That way, I could sit and listen to
                    them and get ideas for reports written on what they felt on various subjects.
                    I'd throw out a subject or if I didn't, they would start talking about various
                    developments. It was amusing at times. Sometimes, I would have people at my
                    table who had lived on the island and hadn't seen each other for years. I said,
                    “I don't understand. This is a small island. You haven't seen one another for 10
                    years?” “No.” It was proved later to me when everybody left and I was going back
                    to the office. Here were guests out in the street, standing and talking to one
                    another, trying to cover some years of memories.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about when you arrived about the state of
                        relations between Malta and the United States. What was our interest at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: One was to try to get American business firms to come in or at least
                    promote commerce, but that wasn't the major task. The previous ambassador,
                    Ambassador Feldman, had assiduously cultivated business people. The rest of the
                    staff and I were trying to develop and to leave a good feeling about the United
                    States. We would explain U.S. events and policies at every possibility. All in
                    all, we had a good number of relationships. The U.S. Navy ships periodically
                    came into port. They would do two things. One, crew members gave blood. Two,
                    they would give books and educational materials to the Maltese. Or they would
                    even come ashore and paint a school for them. The Navy did a very good job
                    there. The feeling was very good, I would say, all the way through, except for
                    one major event.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1970 (I left in December of 1970.), a black Navy sailor had
                    killed a Maltese prostitute. That really started particularly the Labor group of
                    people yelling about the sailors: “See what they do when they come ashore.” That
                    was one time that the minister of foreign affairs came to my office and asked
                    that the sailor be turned over for trial. Meanwhile, I had been on the phone and
                    was sending telegrams back to Washington on the whole affair. They sent a Navy
                    lawyer in, not necessarily to defend the fellow, but to just be there and advise
                    us.” That was one case where the feeling wasn't so good vis a vis the United
                    States. That was primarily the government and certain anti-U.S. elements, not
                    everybody. Actually, it was one of the friendliest posts where I served.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the British navy pulled out of Malta by this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Not at the time I was there. It happened. A few months after I left - I
                    would like to have stayed on another six months because Mintoff came into power
                    in about four months. When Mintoff came in, they started closing down access to
                    the British and the U.S. ships. Malta had a shipyard. Some ships would come in
                    for repair. Others would come in just to service other vessels. Either the
                    British or ourselves would have a vessel that had dentists, doctors, a shipboard
                    PX. Other ships would come in and their crews could get their teeth fixed or
                    whatever. The British were doing the same thing. Right after I left, things
                    began to change, and Navy ships were no longer welcome. Certainly Ambassador
                    Pritzlaff was really trying to do all he could to foster good relations. I think
                    he made a good impression, like Feldman had made.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>As far as feelings of the people, I would say, on balance, except for a few
                    things like the murder of the prostitute, they were very friendly. We could talk
                    to government officials easily. It wasn't like in a big country where you had to
                    go through layers of bureaucracy to get to the top people. You'd get right in to
                    them. Quite often in the discussions, certain things would come up. When the new
                    ambassador, Pritzlaff, was coming, I had a talk with Mintoff's chief deputy, a
                    fellow by the name of Joseph Camilleri. He was the Labour Party's international
                    secretary. I had lunch with him and said, “There have been problems with Mintoff
                    and the ambassador that's leaving. A new one is coming in. We'd like to get off
                    on the proper foot. I understand that on the floor of Parliament, Mintoff called
                    Ambassador Smythe a 'clown.'” He said, “Mintoff was very worked up that day.”
                    The episode didn't appear in any English language papers, but it was in the
                    Maltese language paper. We found out about it through our locals. We got on a
                    good standing, at least with Camilleri, who was second in the party.
                    Consequently, that and Ambassador Pritzlaff's manner of operating, I think,
                    improved our relations with the top of the Labor Party. We always had good
                    relations with the subordinates. In fact, I have mementoes that were presented
                    to me by the Maltese Labor Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Libya? Had Qadhafi gotten in there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: That happened under Pritzlaff's regime. Qadhafi visited Malta after
                    Mintoff became prime minister. I was later told that at official functions
                    Qadhafi hogged the limelight. Stepping back a little, we had relations with a
                    lot of American engineers who worked in the oil fields in Libya. Their wives
                    lived in Malta. The men would go back and forth. Another thing that Ambassador
                    Smythe wanted my wife to do was keep in touch with these “oil wives,” as we
                    called them, which she did. In any event, we had good relations as long as King
                    Idris was ruling Libya there, but as soon as the revolution occurred, we had
                    problems. One thing that helped create a problem were actions that the head of
                    American schools in Libya took after Idris was deposed. A friend of his who was
                    Jewish, a Libyan, came to him and asked for protection. So this superintendent
                    of schools spirited him out of the country. Malta was a place that had a lot of
                    bands and repaired band instruments. The school in Tripoli had contact with
                    these repair firms. The superintendent decided that he would bring over some
                    instruments to be worked on. At the same time, he put this fellow in the box. It
                    was called the “Man in the Box Case.” The superintendent got it on an Air Force
                    plane that was going to Malta. The British at the military helped him get the
                    box off, but then they said, “You're going to have to take it from here.” He
                    then went out in the road and flagged down an empty Maltese truck that was going
                    by and asked the driver to help him get these band instruments into a repair
                    shop. After they had gone along a while, he told the driver and his assistant to
                    stop. He told them to get out and walk up the road. Well, this looked like a
                    hijacking. They looked back, and he was on the back of the truck opening this
                    box. A man jumped out and ran across the field. Of course, as soon as the
                    superintendent left, they got out of the area. They reported the incident to the
                    police. The police found him. They told us what had happened. Anyway, we told
                    the superintendent what he had done. He had misused a government vehicle, he had
                    spirited a national out of one country and into this country without immigration
                    and commandeered a truck. By dealing with the Maltese, we got them to impose
                    only a fine. He had to come before the court which imposed the fine and turned
                    him loose. We at the embassy paid the fine because I had already been in contact
                    with the embassy in Libya, and they said that they would pay for anything. I had
                    no compunctions about this commitment. The man was free. Then he was put up in a
                    hotel and broke a mirror or something, so the hotel people were angry. The
                    police were in regular contact with Harry Glazer and me. They called and said,
                    “Your man is on the way to the airport.” So we rushed to the airport and tried
                    to talk him out of leaving, so that he would go back to the U.S. from Malta. He
                    wouldn't do it. He got on the plane to Italy. There wasn't anything we could do
                    to stop him. But we let the embassy in Rome know about the situation. He was
                    going to some school conference there, and we told them to try to get him to
                    return to the U.S. The end of the story was that he did go back to the States
                    from Rome. After they had talked to him, and he left the State Department, a
                    State Department security officer tagged him for arrest. He had to have paid
                    another fine. But he brought his congressman into the case to plead for him. He
                    really didn't suffer much except for reimbursing the U.S. government for paying
                    his fines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Libyan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: If you mean the “man in the box,” he went directly to the airport and
                    caught a plane to Rome. The Libyan charg�, who was normally a friend of mine,
                    was furious. He wanted the Maltese government to send the American back to
                    Libya. We didn't want it. We beat them to the draw by getting him off by paying
                    the fine. The charg� wasn't on very good speaking terms with us after that. We
                    had good rapport with Maltese officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Ambassador Smythe and Mintoff saying he was
                        clown. Was there any particular reason for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: I don't know precisely why. Mintoff disliked the fact that the ambassador
                    had been visiting priests. Of course, he did visit industries, too, but priests
                    were the primary visits. I don't know what the time sequence was, but the
                    ambassador also took to wearing Nehru jackets. A lot of people who knew better
                    would joke with me, “Who is that over there? Is that the Indian ambassador?” I
                    would say, “You know that's Ambassador Smythe.”Q: This was during the end of the
                    end of the 1960s when the avant garde were wearing these things.</p>
                <p>BEAMAN: Right. If he wanted to dress that way, it was all right with me. After
                    all, Shirley Temple Black, when she was ambassador in Ghana wore the local
                    dress. That was one thing. The other was that Mintoff was just angry at various
                    things that the ambassador had done vis a vis the priests or government
                    officials. He may have resented that the ambassador made little attempt to keep
                    in touch with him... I left Malta in December 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>BEAMAN: I wished I could have stayed on. I tried to talk Washington into letting
                    me stay on through the election because of the contacts I had made. But they
                    didn't want that. So I came back to the U.S. The first job that was offered me
                    was science attach� in Teheran. I had developed a good friendship with Herman
                    Pollack. As a result of the work I had done, particularly vis a vis COMSAT in
                    the Philippines by pushing through the Philippine receiving and sending station
                    set up, he wanted to send me to Teheran. I told him that I was not a scientist.
                    He replied that he did not want a scientist; he wanted someone who could manage
                    a program. I accepted. Ambassador MacArthur had accepted me. But then I realized
                    that my wife did not want to go back overseas. About that same time, the
                    Department asked me to take another job. It grew out of Ambassador Hall's study
                    of State Department administration. His study was in the late 1960s and into the
                    1970s when I got back there. One of his recommendations, among other things, was
                    to bring all of the position classification activities, which had been
                    decentralized to the individual bureaus, into one central operation. I was one
                    of three officers who was qualified for the job. One was Idar Rimestad, who by
                    that time was ambassador in Geneva and wasn't about to take it. Don Renard was
                    political officer in Korea and didn't want to take it. Here I was, ready for
                    assignment. I have to admit that I probably, if anything, had better
                    qualifications than either of the other two. I told my prospective supervisor
                    when I took it, “I'll be retiring in about two years. I'll build this operation
                    up, but my wife doesn't want to go back overseas.” So that's what I did. I
                    finally retired in 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time you were working, what were you doing
                        oclassification?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: It was called the Division of Position Pay Management. What I had as my
                    responsibility was classifying local jobs, classifying Civil Service jobs (not
                    me personally, but my staff and I), and then classifying Foreign Service officer
                    positions, and, of all things, classifying embassies. At that time the
                    Department considered and, I guess, Hall recommended, there were too many
                    high-ranking officers. They wanted my division to classify, regardless of who
                    was in them, all the Foreign Service jobs in addition to the Civil Service jobs
                    and the locals. The local positions at that time were classified via
                    correspondence sent in by the various posts. My staff would give answers to the
                    posts without visiting the posts. I said at one time, “Why don't you go out and
                    survey some of these posts.” Well, we didn't have the money for it at that time.
                    That later was what I did after I retired. I was hired as a consultant to do
                    surveys in over 60 countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Another big project was aligning FSO classifications with grades we used in the
                    ranking of Civil Service positions. FSO-1, thus, equaled about a GS-15 or a
                    GS-16 on the Civil Service scale. As the project went on, I started getting
                    criticism from two groups. One were the junior officers. They were saying,
                    “You're cutting off our future. You're cutting out the grades that we might go
                    into.” The senior officers were saying, “You're downgrading us.” I said, “No.
                    You retain your present grade and salary until you leave that job.” I had what I
                    called “the echelon plan.” I always used Vancouver as an example. I would say,
                    “The consul generals' job in Vancouver should be an FSO-3. You've got an FSO-1
                    in there now. The next time, assign an FSO-2. Then the second time around,
                    assign an FSO-3.” That way, I felt that the shock would be less. Anyway, the
                    whole staff worked hard to try to rank all these jobs. But it never went over
                    very well. After I had retired and was teaching at a college, I got a call and
                    the caller started asking me about this plan. They kept talking about the
                    “Beaman Plan.” I said, “What are you talking about, the Beaman Plan? There
                    wasn't any Beaman plan.” “Oh, well, you were in charge at the time, so we call
                    it the Beaman Plan so that if the Hill raised any question, we could say 'Beaman
                    is retired now.'” Anyway, we did classify the FSO jobs. Whether they really
                    followed the echelon plan I doubt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure they haven't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BEAMAN: No. I haven't looked at FSO jobs since retiring. Another problem was
                    Civil Service jobs. They had been inflated, and they didn't match standards,
                    particularly secretaries. I've said in later years that I retired because I got
                    so tired of, one, driving to work in the traffic and, secondly, arguing about
                    secretarial grades. Everybody that was of any rank wanted a grade GS-9
                    secretary. “Joe has a grade GS-9 secretary. Why can't I have one?” There again,
                    we tried to apply Civil Service standards. There were a couple of major cases in
                    classifying. One I thought of recently because Francis Knight (of the Passport
                    Division) died. She was a grade GS-15 and she felt her job was worth GS-16. My
                    supervisor told me, “You analyze it and come up with a recommendation, but get
                    an outside opinion.” So I took it to one of my former bosses, who was in charge
                    of the local office of the American Personnel Society out of Chicago. That was
                    O. Glenn Stahl. I talked to him about it. He studied it, and came up with the
                    same conclusions I had. We turned it down and never got any flack, but my boss
                    said, “On the Hill, she's got a lot of power, and she may seek support there.”
                    For some reason, she didn't. I went to the USUN because of Khrushchev, Castro,
                    and other people's coming there; they felt their security jobs should be grade
                    GS-15. They were GS-13 and GS-14. So, one time, I talked to a person who became
                    President. That was George Bush. He was ambassador at the time. I analyzed all I
                    could at the UN. I was about to leave, and they said, “Oh, you must go and talk
                    to the ambassador.” I think they expected him to put the pressure on. Strangely
                    enough, he didn't. He sat straight up. He had the bluest eyes that I've seen. He
                    spoke in an official manner. We talked about 25 minutes. I explained the
                    problem, and he explained his view. I said, “Thank you” and left. I think they
                    expected him to pound the table and rant a little. I went over to the FBI. The
                    jobs that they had at GS-15 were much stronger than our security jobs.</p>

                    classifying jobs and erecting wage scales for FSN jobs. There again, we had a
                    book of standards that we were supposed to follow. It's been a fight all along.
                    I always felt that I was, if anything, a little liberal compared to some of my
                    workmates. Nevertheless, I tried to find a justification for my decisions. The
                    thing that distressed me before I retired was: we'd get a call on Friday from
                    some bureau and they would say, “The White House is sending Joe Dokes over for
                    grade GS-15 to be sworn in on Monday.” I would say, “What do you mean? I don't
                    even have a job sheet for the job.” “Oh, we'll send you one later.” When I went
                    to my boss on this, he said, “If the White House wants it, you've got to go
                    along with it.” So, I would approve it. Then sometimes I would have to fight
                    them for weeks to get a job sheet out of the bureau. Meanwhile, a grade GS-14 or
                    GS-15 or whatever was already at work in the State Department. No one seemed to
                    understand that a job sheet is a pay document. It's been a life of interest but
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>May I make a closing statement? This series of interviews has caused me to focus
                    more clearly on what was happening in my Foreign Service career, the dream of
                    which began as far back as 1933. I had a very good career, the kind of work I
                    can happily recommend to an ambitious young person wishing to serve our country.
                    As the text of these interviews reveal, the work is varied and gratifying,
                    occasionally frustrating. Even though I consistently sought to do economic work,
                    there were numerous assignments which provided me with broader knowledge and
                    skills than, perhaps, I realized at the time. Near the end of my career, Herman
                    Pollack provided a proper evaluation when he offered me the position as science
                    attach� in Teheran. When I protested that I was not a scientist, he replied that
                    he was not looking for a scientist; he wanted a program manager. When I checked
                    the State Department's final printout on my service, my specialty was listed as
                    “Program Manager.”</p>
