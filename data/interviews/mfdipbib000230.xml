                <p>Initial interview date: December 17, 1992</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Monique Wong on December 17, 1992. I am
                        interviewing Mrs. Magda Cooper for the Foreign Service Spouse Oral History
                        in Washington, D.C. This is Tape I, Side A.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Magda, thank you very much for letting me interview you for the Foreign Service
                    Spouse Oral History. I'm mostly interested in two big things. One is your
                    involvement in the Foreign-Born Spouse Group and the other is your involvement
                    as the Co-Chair for the Foreign Group of the AAFSW. Let's start with the
                    foreign-born spouses. You are of course a Foreign Service spouse with many years
                    of experience and also happen to be a foreign-born spouse from Peru. I thought
                    we could talk about that a little bit. Now, perhaps you can tell me first of
                    all, how long have you been involved with the Foreign-Born Spouse Group?</p>
                <p>COOPER: Monique, when I came back from overseas in 1986, I noticed in the
                    American Association for Foreign Service Women Newsletter that there was going
                    to be a workshop on foreign-born spouses at the Overseas Briefing Center (OBC).
                    I was very interested on the issues discussed there, so I attended. It was a
                    very successful meeting. And then I realized that there was a group of
                    foreign-born spouses and I joined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit more about that workshop you attended
                        at OBC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Yes. It was nice because they asked us very candid questions like, “Just
                    stand up and tell us what bothers you?” Well the first question of course is the
                    fact that sometimes they consider us different. And one lady stood up and she
                    said, “One day a friend of mine came - an American - and she says, 'Tell me. Do
                    you feel more comfortable with an American friend or with a foreign-born
                    friend?'” And her answer is, “A friend is a friend. It's a person. Do they have
                    to wear a name tag?” And I thought her answer was very good. Unfortunately this
                    discussion was not open to more American-born spouses except the panelists and
                    the organizers of the workshops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people do you remember attended that
                        workshop?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>COOPER: At least forty women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was organized by OBC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the panelists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I don't remember their names.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me some of the things that you discussed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: They were discussing, for example, goals. High goals and low goals for
                    the women in the Foreign Service. And that really picked up my attention right
                    away. The title “High Goals and Low Goals.” Of course the high goals were
                    directed toward the American-born and the low goals to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Because apparently they were talking about career-orientation. That more
                    and more American women want to stay home and pursue a career. They are becoming
                    very frustrated by the fact that they cannot pursue their own career by leaving
                    the country every two years. And we more or less conform to the situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The foreign-born spouses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: The foreign-born spouses. I told her that it might be so, but I wanted to
                    change the term because it in itself is condescending. And I said, “Why don't we
                    call it 'long-term' and 'short-term?'” And she immediately agreed. I said, “I
                    have not sat idle in this time.” By then I probably had eighteen years in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when did you start with the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>COOPER: In 1963. I said, “I had short-term jobs like I worked teaching Spanish in
                    Finland. When I came back to the States I either worked as an interpreter or
                    teaching Spanish at the FSI. Again when I went overseas, I did voluntary work.
                    And when I came back to Washington the last time I had a job in the Director
                    General's office. I was the Manager for Foreign Service Day for four years. So
                    it's not that we foreign-born spouses sit idle. We do a lot of things. We are
                    very realistic. We know that our life is such that every two years you have to
                    change your life patterns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we do that in order to stay with the family, stay with
                        your husband.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right. Our families are a very high priority in our life. I would
                    never consider not having an orderly home for the children. For me would be
                    uncomfortable. So once I get them settled, then I go and look for a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say was the outcome of that particular
                        workshop that you attended in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I think there was an awareness of the differences of foreign-born spouses
                    and American-born spouses because we were able to speak out, to express our
                    feelings. I must say most of the girls were real achievers. So there were no
                    shady complaints. But we just wanted to make them realize that because our
                    cultural backgrounds are different, we look at life differently. But it doesn't
                    have better or worse. Just different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, right. So it was a workshop to help the American
                        side of the Foreign Service community to be more in tune with who the
                        foreign-born spouses are and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did anything else follow the workshop? Were there
                        later meetings or anything that came out of that workshop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: No, unfortunately. We continue with our monthly meetings. Within the
                    group, we had very nice luncheons. I remember we had a luncheon as a farewell
                    party. We had one with a speaker. I don't remember who he was. He was a general
                    as I remember. He spoke about Armed Forces and other issues, but not really
                    anything especially concerning our personal activities or our life.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was the same time when you realized that such a
                        group as the Foreign-Born Spouse Group exists in the AAFSW?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's when you joined then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's when I joined, in 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that apparently came out from [AAFSW] Forum, didn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I was not familiar with Forum yet. I had just come back from overseas. I
                    know now that Forum in those days not only organized the foreign-born spouses,
                    but as of today, Forum is in charge of a wife, American and foreign spouses with
                    young children who have the problem of child care. We have the Forum general
                    meetings. We invite people from the State Department personnel, such as one
                    speaker to tell us about what are the main issues concerning the life of the
                    Foreign Service officers which are all our husbands.</p>
                <p>Then we also have a link with the retired wives of Foreign Service officers.
                    Either retired or widows that have another problem, which is do they have enough
                    pension to survive? Are they dealing in investments and buying enough stocks
                    wisely so they can keep their income flowing and inflation doesn't beat their
                    income. They are also part of our group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Forum is a much larger group in terms of taking care of
                        the concerns of Foreign Service families.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get back to the Foreign-Born Spouse Group that you
                        joined in 1986. Describe to me for a moment here Magda what was it like? Who
                        was in charge? How many people were there? Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: It was a very cozy group. We had a fantastic president then, Ellie
                    Friedman who is now the wife of our Ambassador to Mozambique. She did a
                    wonderful job. We had at least thirty to forty members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is Ellie Friedman from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>COOPER: Ellie is from Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where were the members from, the thirty, forty
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Oh, different places. A girl from Finland replaced Ellie when Ellie
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I don't remember her last name...Larson. She was also a wonderful member.
                    We had girls from all over the world. We had people from Chile, from Argentina,
                    the whole spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any men?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: No. We didn't have men members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say the age group was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: We had some retired spouses that were foreign-born. So it varied from
                    twenty-five to sixty, sixty-five.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of things did you do as a group in — that would
                        be in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: We did a lot of cultural things like museums. There is a yearly house
                    exhibit, interior decoration. We went to one of those, the Washington interior
                    decoration housing, whose funds go to the National Symphony Orchestra of
                    Washington. We had luncheons. We had Christmas parties. But it was very much
                    social, very social.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any need to deal with any kind of topics at that
                        time? Concerns, issues, or anything at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>COOPER: I'm not aware of what happened afterwards. I left in '88 to go to
                    Grenada, and the other day I found an old newsletter and apparently another
                    member that is still a very active member, Elisa Freeman, had a luncheon, and
                    she had Mrs. Nancy Asencio as the speaker. Nancy Asencio is the wife of
                    Ambassador Asencio and she is originally from Cuba. But I was not present at
                    that luncheon because I was overseas. Q: Let's look at the overseas picture for
                    a moment here Magda. You served in Scotland, Costa Rica, Colombia, and so on.
                    Tell me, at those various posts, how many foreign-born spouses did you meet?
                    Just roughly.</p>
                <p>COOPER: Well, it varies. In Latin America, for example, the number of
                    foreign-born spouses was very high. We had at least fifty percent Latin
                    Americans when we were in Bogota, Colombia. Q: Were they all Latin American
                    spouses, or not?</p>
                <p>COOPER: The majority of them were Latin American, yes. They had an advantage,
                    geographically speaking. They really fall into place in the society, because
                    they don't have language barriers. All the doors are open. That's why I have
                    always said to foreign-born wives never to underestimate your potentiality. You
                    have a fantastic opportunity to show what you can do in the community, to do
                    community work or to be a catalyst between the American-born spouses, the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in, say, Finland? How many foreign-born spouses
                        were there? You were there two times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: The first time, only two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two, and that was in '76, '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Right. The second time there were at least five or six Finnish-born
                    spouses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was '81 to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: No, '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '84 to '86?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Right. To tell you the truth, some of the spouses told me, in confidence,
                    in a very confidential way, that they were not really pleased to be back,
                    because a lot of people, had very high expectations from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Finnish...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: The Finnish spouses. The Finnish people had a lot of expectations. They
                    expected them to entertain a lot more, to be more active. And the Americans too,
                    because they said, “Well, you know, you are in your own country. You shouldn't
                    complain.” This particular person had small children. She didn't have the
                    freedom to do all the things that she would have loved to do, but still she felt
                    the pressure. Because she was foreign-born, she had all the skills to do a
                    better job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was Finnish though, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: She was Finnish. And another thing that bothers sometimes - foreign-born
                    wives - when they return to their country, is that an awful lot of people think
                    that because they are their friend, they can easily, through them, go to the
                    American Embassy and get a visa. That is not true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you get pressure from relatives, friends when you serve
                        in your own country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: You get pressure, right, when you serve in your own country. Now, I know
                    of another situation. A very good friend of mine returned to Peru. Her husband
                    was a DCM. She made a very wise move. First of all, she told all her relatives
                    that family day was once a week. When she would either go to see them or they
                    would come and see her. That her house was the DCM's residence, not her own
                    place. People, relatives, friends could not just pop in every day, every time
                    they felt like it, because her husband had official obligations. He might have
                    to bring people in for drinks or organize meetings, and she had to have her
                    house in shape. Not just full of people roaming around. She really had . . .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She set up some guidelines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Guidelines with her own family. She had a fantastic time. First of all
                    she was an extremely efficient Foreign Service spouse. She would shine whether
                    it was in Peru or Washington or in Guatemala where they ended up. But still,
                    it's not easy. You have to be strong and tell them how you feel, what are your
                    duties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about serving - you just mentioned perfectly about
                        some of the difficulties when you go serve back in your own country - how
                        about serving in the US, back to Washington, DC for example or serving in a
                        third country? What are some of the difficulties?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>COOPER: The first time I had an opportunity to have a country where it was not my
                    own culture, other than Scotland - but I don't count Scotland because they're
                    English speaking and that already was an extension of what the United States
                    would be like - but from Finland. I knew that it was going to be very difficult
                    and very different. But I told you, I am a planner. I don't think you run into
                    difficulties if you plan in advance. What I did was, I was in Medellin,
                    Colombia. My husband received his orders. Finland. We had never been out of the
                    Latin American area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Right. Except for Scotland. So I said, “I will go, but not without
                    language.” Because I have never depended on my husband a hundred percent with
                    language. Asking him, “Could you please make this phone call for me?” I have to
                    be able to have the language in order to function. So, immediately he applied
                    for language training for me for Finnish. I was accepted with a condition that I
                    could not miss classes, because that disrupts the rest of the class. That I take
                    my course seriously, because it's very expensive.</p>
                <p>I solved my problem by bringing a nanny with me. I asked for permission from
                    Immigration for ten months, the length of time we were involved. In those days
                    immigration laws were much more lax than they are now. So my three children, the
                    youngest being only three, didn't suffer my being totally involved in this
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Language training. It paid off. It was a wonderful experience, because
                    when I got to Finland, it not only helped me to get my family very well
                    organized. First of all I was able to find a beautiful house, to rent a
                    wonderful place. I was able to look into schools. One piece of advice that I
                    always give to any person going overseas is not to rely only on the post report.
                    “Go out. Do a little research of your own. There are lots of opportunities out
                    there. Take advantage of them and let your children take advantage of them.”</p>
                <p>So I didn't like the school situation, although, in the post report they were
                    telling us there were two fantastic English-speaking schools. It was a difficult
                    situation. The schools. One of them, just to give you an example, grouped four
                    different age groups in one class. So my twelve-year-old was going to be very
                    bored, studying with an eight-year-old. I inquired around and I ended up talking
                    to the board of education in my neighborhood and I said, “Do you think I can
                    bring my children to the Swedish school system?” They said, “Yes, as long as you
                    get a tutor and help the children out with language.” It was the best move I
                    ever made in my life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess I'm hearing, say for an American spouse, you have
                        serving in the States where it's home, basically, and then serving overseas
                        where it's foreign; but for the foreign-born spouse, serving in your home
                        country is home and then serving overseas is foreign and then serving in
                        America is also foreign in a sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what are some of the difficulties that a foreign-born
                        spouse may encounter back in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I tell you, sometimes coming back to Washington can be the most difficult
                    posting that you get. Adapting. Especially. . . The first time I came back to
                    Washington was in 1966. There were not any of the support systems, networking,
                    that we have today. It was a very difficult adjustment to be made. This is
                    something that I tell all the wives, especially the foreign-born, the fact that
                    we are getting together now is to express our feelings, to express our mind.
                    It's okay to say “I'm going through difficult times.” That's not being
                    nagging.</p>
                <p>For example, going to a doctor here is difficult. Most of us in our home towns,
                    we have a doctor within our family. I had my own father. There is always
                    somebody. And you just stay home, and the doctor will come and see you. Here you
                    can be running a very high temperature. The doctor says, “Okay, you want to see
                    me? Come to my office.” That was a big adjustment to make.</p>
                <p>The State Department by then was not well organized. They didn't have the office,
                    for example, that we have now, of the Family Liaison Office or the Employee
                    Consultation Service. Where if you have a tragedy in your life, or a problem,
                    you say, “Listen, I need help. I'm going through a very hard period of time.” I
                    lost a child. [pauses] But, the main thing is, you don't speak about it because
                    you think, “Well, who is going to listen to me? Who wants to listen to me?”Q:
                    I'm so sorry.</p>
                <p>COOPER: Anyway, this was almost twenty-two years ago, no more than that,
                    twenty-seven years ago. A tragedy's a tragedy, but if you have your family, if
                    you have your immediate family with you, it's not so much. It's a support system
                    that you need. But now you have the State Department, you have support systems
                    within the State Department. You have workshops. You have networking. If a women
                    gets breast cancer, there is a group. They meet together. They talk about it,
                    and they discuss issues. In those days there was nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then it's especially difficult for the foreign-born
                        spouses who don't have families here.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>COOPER: Of course. You don't have families. You don't have the support. You don't
                    have anything. Anyway, many spouses can go through the whole, the same
                    experience. It's inhuman not to talk about these things, because they happen.
                    They are real. So you know you call, you say, “I'm going through a very hard
                    time.” Call Jill Chobanian (Employees' Consultation Service Officer, Department
                    of State) and tell her how you feel. If you lost your husband, also tell
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking also, Magda, in terms of the foreign-born
                        spouses, the employee, the husband or the wife - most of the time husbands
                        as we know - are coming back to the States and that's their home country.
                        Does that create a problem? Do you know what I'm talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Yes, it is a problem, because you realize how culturally different we are
                    from each other. This is something the husband never really understands, because
                    you are trying so hard to adapt that you ignore your inner feelings and you
                    don't talk about it. For example, we grieve differently. The Americans in a way,
                    especially the males, they tend to say “life goes on.” In our society we feel
                    guilty if we cut that part of your life which is sorrow. You have to express
                    yourself. You have to feel sorrowful, because that links you with the void, with
                    the person that you're missing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: And the only way to give that person respect, to show that she was part
                    of you or he was part of you, is by giving time to the grieving process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To heal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: To heal. And in the American mind, or in the American culture, that is
                    not so. So of course there are many differences. There are many differences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk for a moment how you see that. What are
                        some of the conflicting values, perhaps, that you feel between your culture
                        and the American culture that have created tensions or problems? That you
                        have to adjust to.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>COOPER: You know, just the general. . . For example, I would say priorities. What
                    is important in your life. You set your own priorities, and you never stop
                    setting your priorities, because that's how your culture formed you. So for me,
                    the family is very important. If I get a job, I get a job, but for me it's not
                    that important. If it's going to interfere with my family's well-being, I will
                    definitely either delay my employment or postpone it.</p>
                <p>For example, once I came back to Washington and I went right back to work and the
                    children would come home and I wasn't home. The amount of guilt that I felt, and
                    the anxiety in order to come home before they would get [home]. Well, they were
                    home before I came home. It didn't seem to bother, for example, my partner, but
                    it bothered me tremendously. Even if it was a couple of hours that the children
                    were going to be alone, because anything could happen. You know we are very
                    protective in our way of raising children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps we can look at raising children for a little while
                        here, Magda. We both attended a meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...on raising children in a bi-cultural marriage. Since
                        you have grown children, tell me a little bit about how that was like for
                        you, with two cultures in the family, two languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Two languages. Three.[laughs]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Three.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Three, because they went to Swedish schools. I never sort of enforced
                    either culture. I let it happen. I was very natural about it, because I think if
                    you try too hard, one way or the other, the children rebel. So the children had
                    to look at you as a set of parents, and they acquire values from each one of
                    you. I think my kids have a fantastic sense of, for example, work ethic, which
                    comes from my husband. He is a very hardworking person.</p>
                <p>I have also been able to raise my daughter with the same goals that the boys
                    have. I have two boys and one girl. And my girl is definitely an excellent
                    student. Dean's list. Her first priority is to accomplish a career in her life.
                    But I think my kids are very family-oriented in the sense that they — every
                    break, every vacation they want to come home. They respect both of our
                    cultures.</p>

                    America for the majority of our assignments, and when possible, like when we
                    went to Finland, I took the nanny with us, and the nanny spoke only Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, okay. And your husband spoke, speaks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fluent Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Fluent Spanish. And I took them home to see my parents. They also look
                    for foreign kids. If there's a Spanish-speaking person in a group, they go and
                    talk to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: This is something that we had to learn as foreign spouses. We are not
                    only going to depend on the American wives to organize things for us. We have to
                    give and, not only take, but give. This is something that I have really
                    instilled in my children. “What you are getting, give it to somebody else.”
                    Because they have this exposure of foreign countries and foreign people and they
                    know people very well. They don't have prejudices. If they do, well, they know
                    better, not to show them, because you can never tell how your children are
                    feeling. But they are in general very careful human beings, because they don't
                    want to hurt anybody's feelings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very sensitive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: They're very sensitive to them. I have always told them,”Be careful.” I
                    think you teach by example. They get involved. For example, the older boy is
                    teaching Spanish to Central American refugees after working hours two or three
                    hours a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In DC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: In DC. That was his own initiative. “Well you know I have to make a
                    contribution.” He's fluent in Spanish and he feels he's giving these Central
                    Americans - the majority are from El Salvador - something that he has and he
                    never takes, took for granted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do they feel? Do they really feel like that's a
                        Spanish and then the American....They're both pretty comfortable cultures to
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Yes, they feel very comfortable in both cultures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so. It sounds like it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Two of them were here for Thanksgiving and there is the Peruvian
                    restaurant called Cuzco, and I took them to the restaurant. Of course they knew
                    the menu. They knew exactly what. . . All their favorite dishes. They all ask me
                    to cook for them special things. When I went to see the one in Colorado, I had
                    to make a Spanish paella for him and his classmates. So they are very fond of
                    what home is like, and it's nice to give them that feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Magda, Let's turn to the citizenship issue for a moment.
                        We both know that becoming an American citizen could be a concern for some
                        foreign-born spouses. What was it like for you? Was there any question that
                        you were going to become a citizen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Well, I got married in 1963. The process was completely different to what
                    it is today. My husband had to submit his resignation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: We met in Peru. I had been here in the United States before, in college.
                    Then I returned to Peru, and when I went back to Peru I met him. He had to
                    submit his resignation. It took over six months to hear back from the State
                    Department whether they had approved his marrying me or not. That was a
                    tremendous — a true love trial. Then, immediately after, we were transferred
                    overseas to Scotland. They would not allow a foreign-born spouse to go overseas
                    before getting her naturalization papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: So, we had about six weeks of time off, came to the States. In three
                    weeks I got my U.S. citizenship. So I never thought about it. I knew it had to
                    be done. It was a must. We didn't have a choice. Nowadays foreign-born spouses
                    can choose. In my personal experience, it has been to my advantage, because I
                    have been able to get federal jobs here in Washington in the State Department.
                    After all, your children are American, so they want the mother to have the same
                    citizenship. At least my kids feel that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I can understand why some spouses, foreign-born spouses, want to keep their
                    passport. First of all, now there are dual nationalities, recognized in many
                    countries. If the marriage doesn't work, and they want to return to their
                    country and they don't have access to. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Or the legal rights that they had before, because they gave up their
                    citizenship. Where do they go? It has pros and cons. I just leave it to the
                    individual. They have to make their own decision in that respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, certainly without U.S. citizenship, employment is a
                        little harder for the spouses overseas. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Definitely. Overseas and even in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Magda, tell me what your perspective is on how Americans
                        relate to foreign-born spouses, either at post or just in general. We talked
                        earlier that they may not understand how foreign-born spouses. . . What kind
                        of concerns they have. But in general what is your. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I find that in many instances, the foreign-born spouse tends to feel
                    threatened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Overseas. I'm here, too, threatened by the power that the American woman
                    has.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: And this is something that I always try to stress. “It's not so. You have
                    to open yourself and get to know that person better and you will realize that
                    deep inside they have exactly the problems, the same problems, you have.” Only
                    we, especially Latin Americans, we speak more about things. We express
                    ourselves. We call each other. We have a network.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The American women are more reserved. They don't say how they feel. It's almost
                    bad form to tell everybody what is going on with your life. But I think we're
                    getting - especially in our group - we're getting more and more conscious that
                    we have a common ground. That's why I'm so happy to have been able to be on the
                    board of the American Association of Foreign Service Women, because we just tell
                    in the open what is wrong. What happens. If a family or a couple is having
                    problems, we can approach the wife and try to help. So. . . [pause in tape]</p>
                <p>Monique, you probably are aware that we are. . . We have now lawyers who have
                    issued the law practices of the three different departments for areas, like we
                    have contacts with the divorce laws of DC, of Maryland and Virginia. Make a very
                    thorough study to see which one has better rates, which one would give the
                    spouse a better deal should she have to divorce her husband if the situation
                    becomes unbearable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I didn't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: So, there are so many things that we have been able to accomplish that
                    help any person in distress that I find I'm in a privileged situation by being
                    part of this group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I guess the legal system would also help the
                        foreign-born spouses, of course, in case when they get divorced or separated
                        from their husbands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any kind of special things that you're aware of
                        regarding foreign-born spouses in divorce and separation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Yes, but you see the advantages that all spouses in general have today is
                    that we have so many more support systems within the State Department. They can
                    go to the Employee Consultation Service. They can go to the Family Liaison
                    Office. They can give advice on. . . Either go through counseling, so they can
                    work out the differences, or, if the situation is such that it is better for
                    them not to be together, they can refer them to the best lawyers we have. Now
                    that we have our computer link we have names of every lawyer that you can
                    imagine in town. [Laughs] And all the information that we're getting within. .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is through AAFSW?</hi>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>COOPER: That's right. All the information that we are getting as far as the
                    babysitting services, old people's homes - in case you have to take your parents
                    should they get in a stage they can not be cared for at home anymore - we are
                    going to place every piece of information that we are gathering in our computer
                    link, so any spouse who needs services, who needs information can just approach
                    us, and they will be served.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Magda, looking at some of these concerns that we have been
                        discussing, how comfortable were you serving overseas with your
                        husband?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: As a foreign spouse. I feel very comfortable, thanks to some fantastic
                    role models that I have had through the years, both American-born and foreign.
                    Foreign spouses that became ambassadors' wives. They gave me the guidelines to
                    be myself, not to try to impress anybody by being somebody else. Natural. Yet,
                    serve with dignity, because it is a responsibility. It's not a game. It's
                    something that I take very seriously. I think our image overseas is very
                    important. We represent one of the biggest countries in the world, and it's only
                    fair that we do our job well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever feel that you were asked certain questions
                        about the United States that you felt uncomfortable with or. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I try always to keep away from politics. I think there are a lot of
                    people that are insensitive and don't have very good manners and could be
                    sometimes even insulting. People like that in any other situation you just
                    ignore. That's what you learn by being assertive. Don't ever pay too much
                    attention to little people. Little minds. Be yourself. Always think in the large
                    scope what is important, and that is a good safeguard not to fall into a
                    trap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also mentioned earlier that you can be, say, a
                        Peruvian overseas and entertain like a Peruvian. Can you. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Oh, yes. That is possible. Do you remember in our first meeting we had a
                    very, very charming girl from the Philippines?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring to our Foreign-Born Spouse Group
                        meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>COOPER: Foreign-Born, from the - yes, from the Philippines. She was in our
                    meeting. She said, “Do you think I can serve Filipino food?” and we said, “Of
                    course! You are the best Filipino cook in town and nobody has the opportunity to
                    try the food that you fix.” You never would do it of course on Thanksgiving Day.
                    But you learn when to do things in the appropriate time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it's important for a foreign-born spouse to
                        speak very good English and to know American history, American government,
                        American culture very well when they go overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Important? Of course it is important. Any extra bit of education that you
                    have adds to you as an asset, to this organization and to your husband. So I
                    never stop learning. I have tried to join all the Overseas Briefing Center
                    workshops that there are whenever I'm in Washington. There's a lot to learn.</p>
                <p>At the present time I'm taking courses at American University on the American
                    family. I'm learning a lot of history at the same time. We have to be aware of
                    what is going on in this country to project ourselves as well-educated people.
                    Unfortunately, we spend so much time overseas that we don't have these
                    opportunities often, but when we do, we should take advantage of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some may disagree with you there and say, “Well, you don't
                        actually...You're not the employee. Your husbands or your wives are the
                        employees and therefore you're not really representing the U.S.” Would you
                        agree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: No, because when we go overseas as a couple, the local people, they view
                    us as the two for the price of one, unfortunately. No matter how many new laws
                    exist, that's what they expect from you. If they send somebody who is just a
                    mediocre person, that reveals the United States doesn't have enough interest in
                    that country so they're just sending somebody. So, the more dignity and the more
                    importance that you give to your job, the better projection you make. They feel,
                    the host country, feels that they deserve better. There is always some gossip
                    going about the previous two or three people before, and the mistakes they made.
                    So you are very conscious of trying to project yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, even though, what you're saying is that, even though
                        the law may say that spouse is not judged, the reality is that they are
                        judged.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Of course they are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By local people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>COOPER: By local people especially. The way you entertain, the way you conduct
                    yourself, the contribution you make. And they're comparing you with people from
                    other embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: The other embassies probably are doing as much effort as you are, in
                    order to perform well. The diplomatic career, no matter how new issues come
                    about, will always involve the spouse, as long as you go together overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The foreign-born spouses is another dimension of the
                        American culture since we have many, many foreigners in the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Magda, tell me for a moment here about how your family
                        feels about your marrying an American and serving overseas for America? Have
                        they ever expressed any sort of. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Animosity?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not, not. . . That's not what I'm looking for. But how did
                        they feel? What did they say to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I think they. . . First of all, they took my husband first, not as an
                    American or as a diplomat, as a person. They liked him, and he was accepted. So
                    that was the first step. If they wouldn't have liked him they probably would
                    have said, “No, we don't want you to marry him.” Because Latin American parents
                    are still very influential on whatever decision you make, on the children's
                    decisions. They never really interfered in our relationship and we were able to.
                    . .</p>
                <p>In that sense it's an advantage. I think we Foreign Service families have an
                    advantage that many families don't have in the sense that we are so far away
                    from our families, immediate families, that there is not interference. If you
                    have problems, you tend to work them out together.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>That gives you a fantastic sense of growth, and a sense of self, because you have
                    to do extensive growing up on your own. Mami is not there. You can not just take
                    the phone every other day and tell, “Mami, I'm having a problem.” You solve your
                    problems. You try to see what are your weaknesses and how you can improve them.
                    If your husband has some - which in many instances he can be blamed for problems
                    - you just talk about it. Say. Speak your mind. Say, “You know, I give up a lot
                    to be your partner. So I expect a lot too.” It's a reciprocal give and take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But does your family have any sort of idea of what it is
                        like for you to be in the Foreign Service, in the American Foreign Service?
                        Do they say, “Oh, that's so great, so glamorous”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Yes, I think they. . . Everybody thinks it's such a glamorous career, and
                    it is. But it's a lot of work, too. It is a lot of work, adjusting, worrying
                    about the children, the future. Are they going to be okay? Are all these moves
                    going to be a problem in the future? Are the children going to be deprived of
                    educational, the American educational system?</p>
                <p>But in general they gain so much from being overseas, because they learn about
                    the world on a first time basis. Nobody has a classroom. They learn from nature.
                    Everything is open for them. My children can ski, can climb mountains, can do so
                    many things. You feel guilty about detaching them from their roots and their
                    friends, but then that's why the family can be such a strong element in their
                    lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I sort of want to turn to something different here, Magda.
                        If you will compare the American Foreign Service with the Peruvian
                        diplomatic service for me. Are you aware of how the diplomats are chosen in
                        Peru, and how they choose their assignments and so on and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Peru has a very good professional foreign service, but I'm not familiar
                    with what is going on at the present time, because I have not been in touch with
                    any embassies, per se. I do have a little group of Peruvian friends here in
                    Washington. We meet occasionally. They send me invitations for, for example,
                    Christmas parties. I try to be in touch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they diplomats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: No. They're just residents. I haven't been in touch with diplomats for a
                    long time, because the last time, for example, when we were overseas, was in
                    Grenada, and Grenada only had three or four embassies. Peru didn't have
                    representation there. So I don't know what is going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just curious, that's all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: The country's going through changes as you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes, of course. Magda, so you were involved with the
                        Foreign-Born Spouse Group in '86 and then you went overseas. Later on, did
                        you get involved with the group again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Yes, I came back from overseas in 1991. That's when I was approached to
                    join the board of AAFSW. I was very happy that I did it, because it has been a
                    wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you asked to do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: They asked me,”Would you like to be on the board?”, and I said, “Yes, and
                    I'm very interested in Forum, because I would like to deal with the issues.”
                    They put me as Co-Chair with Maggie Morse who's been a chairman of Forum for
                    several years. She's an experienced member. We are working together very
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So through Forum you got back. . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I got back and they said, “Well we're going to get the group going
                    again.” And that's when you became the Chairman of the group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: So, I started to go to the meetings. I'm very, very impressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Things are going well. The difference in the Foreign-Born Wives' Group
                    now is that we're dealing with issues. We're trying to have more meetings with
                    speakers, like we have had so far, and discuss what makes the foreign-born
                    spouse comfortable, more comfortable. We want to welcome them, to tell them,
                    “You are needed. You are valuable. You are part of us.” So when they go overseas
                    there will never be a separation of foreign versus American. They said, “In
                    Washington we were received with open arms.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>As you saw the other day, our president, Christine, she went to our Christmas
                    party, and she told the foreign-born spouses, “If you have any problems, please
                    come and talk to me.” In an organization as large as the State Department, it is
                    important that people feel welcomed, because you, generally, don't like to be
                    taken for granted. They do the work. They work all the time, and to come to
                    Washington and be ignored. I feel like - everybody feels once in awhile - like
                    having a little pat on their back.</p>
                <p>This is essential for us to continue as a group and also to be part of this big
                    organization, the Foreign Service, that demands a lot from the families.
                    Fortunately, they are doing a lot more in recent years to make our lives more
                    comfortable. Still, we have tremendous hurdles to pass in order to be effective
                    and to be happy at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you feel that our approach now with addressing issues
                        directly is a good way to continue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I think it's very effective, because my feeling is that we have to make -
                    especially the very new foreign-born spouses, the ones that are just getting on
                    board - aware of what is available for them. So they don't miss anything. Take
                    advantage of language training. Get ready. Plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Especially those who just come into the United States for
                        the first time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After they got married overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: That's right. Try to get a job when you are overseas with the government
                    so when you come back you have the executive order and you are able to be
                    reintegrated in your job in Washington. If you don't tell the spouses what is
                    available, there is no way they're going to find out, and this is a fantastic
                    way to keep everybody informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk on the Forum a little bit. I'd like to hear
                        what's going on with the Forum and what exactly is its purpose, how often
                        you meet, and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>COOPER: Well, the last meeting we had was on November 21. We had three speakers,
                    Jill Chobanian, who is the Employees' Consultation Service Officer. From the
                    Family Liaison Office we had Jo-Anne Vaughn. Both of them addressed the issues
                    of adjusting to the Foreign Service when both couples are working. The burden on
                    the family and the transition in Washington, where to send the children, whether
                    it would be better to be overseas so the children can profit from the boarding
                    school system.</p>
                <p>Then we had also the AFSA Vice President, Mr. Joseph Melrose. He talked to us
                    about the selection out process, which, unfortunately, is going to affect a lot
                    of our future, middle career officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Well, this is very involved. It would take us another session to explain,
                    but the bottom line is this: that we have to know. We have to be prepared for
                    it. Should our husbands have to leave the Service in their, let's say, early
                    forties, they should be, both as a couple, should be contemplating a second
                    career. Also, providing funds, savings, for you and your children. What happens
                    if the husband is selected out when you are paying college education? Or you're
                    having parents who need care, and that could perfectly well happen when you are
                    in your forties. So, we are warning the families, “This can happen to you. Let's
                    be ready.”</p>
                <p>In order to emphasize the savings part of the Forum, we had Lynn Alexis Corey,
                    Lee Corey, who is a financial planner. She talked to us about the different
                    savings devices that there are, and how you can put money aside for your
                    children's education, for your own pension. Especially women, for us, we don't
                    have full-time jobs. We have not been able to accumulate enough social security
                    for our own pensions. She gave us tremendous information regarding how to save
                    for the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How often does the Forum meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: We have monthly meetings. When we bring all the group together, we bring
                    the young mothers with the child care problem. We update on what is going on.
                    The amount of children that are now being placed in different houses. So far we
                    have tried to have private houses. This has also given a business, a new career,
                    to some of the spouses. They're running a small, little nursing place, day care
                    center. This will go also on the computer link, information about the wives,
                    spouses that are opening day care centers in their house.</p>
                <p>Then we bring the representative of the senior, retired spouses. And she lets us
                    know what is going on, how they are coping with different situations, and what
                    can be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Then we have the program. We have been very lucky to have Joan Dixon, who still
                    is involved in Forum. She's been a wonderful help to organize our programs. She
                    has very good ideas. She's a very experienced Foreign Service spouse. We sit
                    together with Maggie and Jean and the other spouses that are in the subgroups,
                    and we discuss what are the themes that would most interest our wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are the subgroups, Magda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Well, the subgroups, the side groups I could say.....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Like the mothers who are running the day care centers. They are not
                    Co-Chairs, but they are like part of our group, and the representative of the
                    senior spouses. They all come to the meetings, and they inform us about their
                    concerns. We try to deal with the problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When is the next Forum going to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: We'll probably have our next meeting in January, after the holidays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of things are being planned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: We'll discuss them in January. We are planning to have a very interesting
                    year with the new administration and new elements in our Foreign Service. We are
                    all unaware of what is going to happen after January 20. So that will be a
                    starting point. We'll discuss our program then.</p>

                <p>COOPER: Well, I think it's not a happy situation. My feeling is that this new law
                    is going to affect negatively our Foreign Service dependents in a way that they
                    will not have the jobs that are already scarce available only for Foreign
                    Service dependents. Now they have to share it with somebody else. So, it is. . .
                    . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Share it with the overseas Americans you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>COOPER: Residents, right. It is going to be problematic. I find it difficult.
                    They're talking about drivers and cooks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Various positions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Various positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many different positions. They also mention, I think,
                        accountants, lawyers, something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: Well, there are two sides to this problem. It's also going to create
                    tremendous resentment among the local communities that get jobs within an
                    embassy, and they need those jobs. So you're replacing Americans, so-called
                    wealthy Americans, and displacing the local employees. It's not a very good
                    image policy.</p>
                <p>Who are these Americans overseas? We don't know. They might be spouses of, let's
                    say Exxon Corporation, or an automobile industry overseas. Now, if their spouses
                    need jobs, don't you feel that they could perfectly be entitled to get their
                    jobs from their companies, from American firms overseas?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know. I haven't been overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: I don't know where to draw the line. I don't know who these Americans
                    are. So, if the law applies to every American overseas, I think it's unfair to
                    include the spouses of employees from big firms, big corporations, because they
                    could be able to provide jobs for their dependents as well and not rely on the
                    U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we have covered a lot here, Magda. Do you have
                        anything you would like to add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COOPER: No, Monique. Thank you very much.</p>
