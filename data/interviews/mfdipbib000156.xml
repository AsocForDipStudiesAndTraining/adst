                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Sunday, October 25th, 1992. This is Monique Wong.
                        I'm interviewing Mrs. Peggy Ann Brown at her home for the Foreign Service
                        Spouse Oral History program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mrs. Brown, thank you very much for letting me come by to interview you for the
                    Foreign Service Spouse Oral History program. First of all I thought I would ask
                    you about the Foreign Service Reserve. I understand that your husband came into
                    the Foreign Service under something called the Foreign Service Reserve. Could
                    you tell me a little bit about that?</p>
                <p>BROWN: He did that, I think, in the year 1945, because before the war he had been
                    a partner in a New York law firm. And then the war came and he wanted to do
                    something in the war. So he was told by a friend or friends about an opportunity
                    to serve the government in the State Department on what was being set up as the
                    Lend Lease program then. His first boss at that time was a man named Oscar Cox
                    whom I never met. So he came down and was offered a job. “Yes, please come and
                    help us.” And he came down to Washington. How long he was here before going to
                    England I just don't know, but he went to England very early on in the war to
                    help set up the Lend Lease Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, in London. And Governor Harriman came to London to be in charge of the
                    program shortly after. I would say offhand that was 1940 or '41. I know in all
                    he was in London for four and a half years during the war in the embassy which
                    is, as I told you, where we met. Because I was in the American Red Cross and we
                    met at a dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you met in London?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BROWN: We met in London, yes. Through a mutual friend we met at a dinner. We
                    began a courtship, I guess is the only word you can call it, which was very
                    difficult because he stayed on in London and I was sent to Europe after the
                    invasion of Normandy. So the only time we saw each other was when I would come
                    back to London on leave or something like that. And we got engaged,
                    semi-engaged. Both of us were a little bit worried because it was wartime and we
                    thought, “Is this crazy and do we really know each other that well?” Well, the
                    way you would worry in wartime.</p>
                <p>And in 1945, he came back to Washington and, I think - I can't remember exactly
                    the circumstances - he was asked to stay in the State Department. He could have
                    gone back to his law practice in New York. But he was asked to stay on in the
                    Foreign Service Reserve and at that time became head of the commercial policy
                    section of the Department. And at that time they were terribly busy and, as you
                    know, the United States had taken on a totally new role at that time as - well
                    people call it “the leader of the Free World.” We were the one country that was
                    undamaged by the war. We were the country that had the money. We were the
                    country that could provide the leadership for the rest of the world to come out
                    of the war and the wartime troubles.</p>
                <p>There were many men who had wonderful far-ranging ideas. Amongst them were people
                    who had been thinking what we should do is lead the effort to free trade and
                    tariffs and make circumstances better for exchange of goods between countries.
                    And that problem was put to his division in the department and he testified on
                    the Hill. Well, we were married in 1946, and had no honeymoon whatsoever, no
                    break or anything. We came directly to Washington and he was testifying on the
                    Hill before the Senate everyday for hours on what the United States proposed to
                    do about lowering tariffs to promote trade and trying to get the nations of the
                    whole world to agree to that. We will do this if you will do that. You know, one
                    great big bargaining session which was to take place in Geneva, what was called
                    the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</p>
                <p>Those were wonderful days because President Harry Truman was simply marvelous. He
                    backed the State Department completely on it. He said, “You go right ahead and
                    do this. I think this is right to do and I'll take the political heat. I don't
                    care what people say about it. This is the right thing to do. You go and do
                    it.”</p>
                <p>So my husband, with Mr. William Clayton who was under secretary for economic
                    affairs at that time, went to Geneva with a number of other men from the State
                    Department who were very bright and who had been dreaming and thinking about
                    this for years, who had been here in the United States during the war thinking
                    about all the things we must do after the war. And the simple fact was that my
                    husband sort of became the spokesman for these people. He was not an economist.
                    But they briefed him so that he was the one who went before the senate committee
                    and pled the case and then went to Geneva and negotiated the treaty having been
                    told all the facts. They said, “Now you go and do it and get it done.”</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Well, we were just married of course and we went there. I was told that the
                    meeting would last about six weeks. All the countries of the whole world came or
                    sent representatives. Except the Russians wouldn't accept and the Japanese
                    wouldn't come at first as I remember, although the Japanese are members now. And
                    we were to be there “six weeks” and we stayed eight months. And then came back,
                    having got the preliminary treaty signed with a certain amount of success, not
                    total success, but a great step forward. We came back and settled down into what
                    we thought would be just a normal life here in Washington working in the State
                    Department. I can't remember who then would have been Win's boss, but somebody
                    came to him one day and said, “We'd like you to go to London as economic
                    counselor at the embassy there. We think the job needs you.” I won't go into
                    personalities. “But you're needed there to straighten some things out.”Q: Was he
                    still in the Foreign Service Reserve at that point?</p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. And he said, “For how long?” And they said, “Oh just a stopgap kind
                    of period to straighten things out because a permanent man will be coming later
                    on. You'd be there about eighteen months.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was 19?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That was 1952 and we had two children by then. And I was thrilled at the
                    idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been there before. You worked there before for the
                        Red Cross.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh yes, of course. And we had many, many friends in England and loved
                    London, loved England. I was thrilled to be going back there and to get out of
                    the housewife's rut that I was in here. So I said, “Yes, yes, tell him we'll go
                    tomorrow.” And we did, taking practically nothing with us except some clothes
                    and things, thinking we were only there for eighteen months and would be coming
                    back very soon. Well time went on and on and on and they kept saying, “Stay on,
                    stay on.”</p>
                <p>And it was a terribly hard time to find a place to live in London because it was
                    just before the coronation. First of all there had been so much bomb damage that
                    a great many houses were not available or usable and everybody and his brother
                    were coming from all over the world to the coronation. I wanted a house with a
                    short lease and they said, “No, they're all taken up.” Well there was an embassy
                    house we could have had but it was quite a mansion. It's still there. I think
                    it's still an embassy house. Number 10 Chester Square with four flights of
                    stairs, a basement kitchen, all kinds of things that for an American seemed
                    impossible. You know you'd have to either kill yourself or you'd have to have a
                    staff of four or five people. And with two little children, you can imagine
                    going from a basement kitchen to a nursery on the fourth floor. It just was too
                    much.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>So I kept trying and therefore we had several moves until finally an embassy
                    house came vacant that was just exactly right. The right size, manageable,
                    everything. And by that time I was a lot more familiar, knew the ropes more. How
                    to get a maid, how to get a cleaning woman, how to get somebody to help you with
                    children and so on. Because social life was very, very demanding on you,
                    probably still is. Certainly more than any other post I've ever known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Every country is represented there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh yes, and much more formal, more precise. You had to be absolutely on
                    time, to be dressed very properly. It was quite something as a first
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm kind of curious about why it was the Foreign Service
                        Reserve when your husband came in because it sounds like what a regular
                        Foreign Service officer would be doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Somewhere in that period he became the regular economic counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So he became a civil servant at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well I don't know. But he was still Foreign Service Reserve. But they
                    said, “All right, forget about somebody taking your place. You just keep on
                    doing the job.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I noticed that he had a career designation as Civil
                        Service GS-16 in 1950. That was sort of curious to me because he was at that
                        time director of office of international trade policy or something like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In the Department?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Department I thought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I thought it was always the commercial policy division. You could be
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know. But at the same time he remained in the
                        Foreign Service Reserve.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. And then became economic counselor. That was his title. He
                    was economic counselor when we first went over, but it was understood to be a
                    very temporary assignment, but somewhere along the line they said, “Okay,
                    consider it permanent. You're not going to go home in eighteen months, in other
                    words. You're going to be here for two years, maybe, or three years.” So that
                    was perfectly all right. We were in a house, very comfortable, that we enjoyed
                    and loved and had renewed friendships with so many English friends and were
                    quite settled in. I think, frankly, we didn't even think of the future, what
                    would happen.</p>
                <p>Then came - and I don't know what year this happened. Would it be - you know more
                    than I - perhaps '53 or '54 - what they call Wristonization. The plan put
                    forward by Mr. Wriston. What's Mr. Wriston's first name? Henry or something?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know I don't know, but I did interview another person,
                        Mary Louise Weiss, whose husband came into the Foreign Service as a
                        Wristonee. In fact, I think that Mary Louise mentioned that your husband was
                        her husband's boss at some point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is an economist and he works in the international trade
                        office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They're terribly nice and he was in Geneva during all the GATT
                    negotiations and she had to stay at home because of her little children so they
                    were separated for quite a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in '52 when you went to London, Ambassador Brown was a
                        Foreign Service Reserve and then later on in '56, he had a designation as
                        O-1 officer. That must have been the Wristonization that you were talking
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I guess so. Of course all those numbers never meant anything to me. You
                    know the GS something or other. I mean he would tell me, but it would go in one
                    ear and out the other. It wouldn't register with me. I never have got all the
                    Civil Service numbers straight in my head. I'm straight in my head about
                    titles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe you could tell me a little bit about the
                        Wristonization. That would be interesting. What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, he came home one day and talked about it. Of course I knew it was
                    going on and we would talk about it, but at one particular time, I suppose, he
                    said, “You know, we've got to make a decision. Because from now on it's going to
                    be a rule in the Department that everyone must serve abroad. There will be no
                    Foreign Service Reserve. You won't have a choice anymore. You either go abroad
                    or leave the Department.” Everybody in the Department, was my understanding,
                    must be willing to serve abroad, and he said, “Well how would you feel about
                    that?” And I said, “Well I wouldn't mind that at all.” We were of course in what
                    to me was the most interesting post that could be, London, which we loved, and
                    all of England and we did a great deal, when we could, of travel on the
                    Continent and everything. The Foreign Service to me was this wonderful place to
                    live. And looking back on it I guess I didn't think through that there could be
                    lots of posts that would be pretty dreadful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the news came when you were in England?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. So he agreed cheerfully and willingly. How much of this is going to
                    be on the record?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You will have a chance to look through the transcript and
                        delete whatever you don't want to have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well I want to be frank about it because as what is called a “Wristonee”,
                    many of our friends in the embassy couldn't have been nicer with
                    congratulations. The people that Win worked with said,”This is the best thing
                    that could have happened to the Foreign Service and it's just great to have
                    you,” and so forth and so on. But there were others who said, “Well, now they're
                    scraping the barrel to get people in.” There were some people who were very
                    resentful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring to Foreign Service officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. I don't remember their names. I was told them at the time, but they
                    weren't really friends. All our real friends were warm and generous and
                    welcoming and so on. But to a lot of people, and I can understand it, who
                    started out in the Foreign Service as young people and worked their way up
                    through years of dreadful posts as junior officers and coming up, there came my
                    husband who came in at a senior position from the side. What would you call
                    it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lateral entry?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, in a senior position as economic counselor, never having had to
                    struggle with this in some god-forsaken place for two years here and two years
                    there and so on. Go up the ladder that way as my son-in-law is doing now. And
                    they were resentful of it. And I can understand that completely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, the Wristonization program was targeting
                        the mid-level or higher officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well I don't know to tell you the truth. Probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what it sounds like. They'd bring in somebody like
                        your husband who already was holding a fairly high and important
                        position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: And saying, “You can't just come and dabble in a foreign post for two or
                    three years and then say, 'Now I want to go home.' If you're going to take a
                    post abroad with responsibility, then you've got to say, yes, you'd go on to
                    another post whether you want to or not.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at that point the Foreign Service Reserve pretty much
                        disappeared?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I guess so. I don't hear of it anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder what the rationale was for that Foreign Service
                        Reserve. It was probably something like maybe people who were holding
                        positions in international offices were in that position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Perhaps so. Something like that. I really don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. Were there other people who didn't want to go
                        into the Foreign Service under this Wriston program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, some people didn't. And they said, “No.” I know of at least two
                    people who said, “No, we don't want to live that kind of life,” and elected to
                    stay here in Washington. The only two I know of - this is terrible - I'm not
                    going to tell you their names - but they were so capable and so good that they
                    could. . . . I think the Department just sort of overlooked it or just swept it
                    under the rug and said, “Well all right.” And kept on having them do their very
                    important jobs and never asked them to go overseas. It was just one of those
                    things. They made an exception of certain people because they were so good they
                    didn't force them to go abroad.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think the program was necessary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't know. I think it was because maybe Mr. Wriston thought the
                    Department wasn't getting full value out of all the people who worked for it.
                    That they should be willy-nilly. It would be like being a Marine or an Army
                    officer and saying, “Yes I'll serve as long as we're in this country, but I
                    don't want to ever go overseas.” You see?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought there was also some problem for actually the
                        Foreign Service officers coming back into the State Department and having
                        difficulty finding better jobs because these were held by somebody like your
                        husband who. . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't know. I really don't. I wouldn't venture an opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very interesting. And that was obviously when there was a
                        rapid expansion after World War II in the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, which expanded then enormously as you've known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think you would have any idea of how many people
                        went through that Wriston program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't have any idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once you were in, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Life kept on just the same. There wasn't any noticeable difference as far
                    as I could see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were already in London obviously.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BROWN: We were in London. My husband kept on doing his job. And as a matter of
                    fact was promoted because he had been the economic counselor and the economic
                    minister. London is a huge post and very important. There's a political minister
                    and an economic minister. The economic minister at our time was a man named
                    Lincoln Gordon and he was nominally my husband's boss, and Winthrop Aldrich was
                    ambassador, boss of everybody. During the time we were in London, they kept
                    having GATT meetings in Geneva. The Department would ask for my husband to come
                    over to Geneva and conduct negotiations. Same old story all over again. It was
                    not a terribly happy time for me because he was gone so much, either here in
                    Washington or in Geneva. In fact I had a baby, I had my third child while he was
                    in Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been hard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It wasn't much fun. And Mr. Aldrich at a reception at the embassy one
                    night - I'll never forget it. He was a very kindly, grandfatherly sort of person
                    and they had asked me. I don't know what the reception was about. It doesn't
                    matter. They gave maybe two a week or something. He came up to me and said,
                    “Come in the library. I want to talk to you.” And we went into the library. And
                    Win had been in Geneva then I think maybe a month, two months. And he said, “I
                    am totally fed up with this system where they take Win away whenever they want
                    him. He belongs here in the embassy. He's my economic minister and I need him.
                    And I just want to tell you that I'm sending a message to the State Department
                    saying that he has to come back to the embassy and not be pulled away all the
                    time for special assignments. He has a big job to do here.” So I wanted to throw
                    my arms around him. (laughter) Of course I just said, “Thank you very much. That
                    would be wonderful.” And so gradually it happened.</p>
                <p>And so when Lincoln Gordon left - I think he later became ambassador to Argentina
                    - I'm not sure if he went directly to Argentina or what happened to him - and
                    they - whoever they is, the Department I guess - said, “Okay, you're economic
                    minister now.” And so that's how we finished our tour in England, as economic
                    minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you moved on to New Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Then moved to New Delhi.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he in the economic ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, from then on he sort of went into the political side of it and he went
                    as deputy chief of mission to India.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Under Ellsworth Bunker. Well I still had my illusions about the Foreign
                    Service, I must say. That ended any idea that all posts would be as nice as
                    London because we arrived in mid-July, probably the worst time of the year,
                    monsoon season where it's terribly hot and humid. Rather like Washington on its
                    worse days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I thought we just couldn't make it. Well it was a cultural shock. It took
                    quite a little time to get used to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember Mary Louise said - she also served in India. I
                        don't know if it was the same time that you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she said it was very colorful but it took a little
                        getting used to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well I think it's the way many foreigners must feel when they come to the
                    United States. It's a terrible cultural shock to come to this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well different!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: But there it's not only the climate, the heat, but all the things you see,
                    you know, the poverty, the smells. Time takes care of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '57 to '60?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Three years. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was Ambassador Brown's job like as deputy chief
                        of mission? How did that affect your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BROWN: We were blessed with this wonderful, wonderful ambassador, Mr. Bunker and
                    his wife who - they're both dead now - were two of the finest people I've ever
                    known. And he said to Win when we first came, “I want you to travel as much as
                    you possibly can. Feel free to go all over India. It'd be a big help to me in
                    fact if I could stay here and I'll mind the shop and you go and make speeches,
                    travel everywhere, do everything.” Obviously he would go when the big occasions
                    were coming up, but he urged Win to get around the country.</p>
                <p>So I think we saw every single part of India. We would take a plane and go to
                    Madras, for instance and stay with the consul general there and then the consul
                    general and his wife would take a couple of consulate cars and we'd go and we'd
                    travel all over. You know, it's a huge country. We'd travel all over his
                    district, making speeches to Rotary clubs and universities and everything. The
                    trips were quite arduous, but at the same time we saw all the temples and famous
                    places. The mosques and on and on all over the country. It was a great
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you took the children along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh no. In the first place it wasn't practical and by then they were in
                    school. They had a little international school there. Except for the youngest
                    child, and I had a very good ayah for her. And the two older children were in
                    school. And in India you have be terribly careful, not only in your daily life
                    but particularly when traveling, of health problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like water and food?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, water and food and what you eat and what you don't eat. You have to be
                    awfully careful. Almost every weekend that we were home, we'd go out in the
                    countryside with the children and have a picnic, go someplace with food from the
                    house. I got hepatitis in India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh did you really? It's pretty common in that part of the
                        world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think every tenth person in the embassy got hepatitis, but I got a
                    terrible case. I think some of my inner problems are due to hepatitis or liver
                    damage or something.</p>
                <p>

                        worried about. Well not very, but certainly something that we should be

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, not really big problems. No more than ordinary childhood things except
                    that Anne, the youngest child, developed boils, terrible boils. Do you have
                    children?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not yet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Boils. Poor little thing. What they came from and why I have no idea
                    because goodness knows I insisted on cleanliness and all kinds of things. She
                    had for a year a series of boils. It still sticks in my mind. They were so
                    painful and she suffered from them so much. But they had nothing else really.
                    The boils returned in Bangkok, though not so severely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And leaving them behind when you went traveling was

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Sure. Well we were never gone more than a week, or ten days.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, we'd go, just the two of us, but it was always with a stated schedule
                    to meet important people in Bombay, we'll say, or make a speech at an important
                    place. It was all planned out weeks in advance. It wasn't just traveling around
                    and looking at the scenery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of those people that you met in those

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Indians?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, you know like people that maybe had business
                        with your husband with the State or other people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I can remember lots of funny incidents. I won't bore you by talking about
                    them. Indians are very fond of speeches and we'd arrive at a town and after a
                    long, long dusty hot drive, we'd be hustled into the guest house or wherever we
                    were to stay and told, “You are expected in ten minutes at the home of the
                    president of the university for dinner,” and we would go. There was scarcely
                    time to take a bath. Some places didn't have a bath. You just had to throw water
                    on yourself and do your best to change clothes and be there and then go through
                    much politeness. No such thing as a calm, quiet drink or rest before dinner,
                    none of that kind of thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not like London.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Rushed to the table, seated at a long table and then an Indian dinner. I
                    had a hard time with Indian food because very early on I had a bad attack of
                    dysentery from, I'm quite sure, something I'd eaten at an Indian dinner the
                    night before. And therefore every time just the smell of curry or whatnot and
                    I'd have to be terribly careful. I'd eat the rice and sort of pick at other
                    things and push the food around on the plate and whatnot. Indians are very
                    sensitive and they'd say, “Oh you don't like our food, do you?” And I'd say, “Oh
                    yes, I do.”</p>
                <p>Senator Moynihan said something a couple of years ago in an interview that amused
                    me very much. He was asked if he ever had dysentery in India. You know he was
                    ambassador there for two or three years, after our time. And he said, “Only
                    once, but it lasted three years!” (laughter) Which is exactly my story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I might have heard of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The person I remember as one of the most interesting persons that we met
                    in India was a man named Kushwant Singh who was a writer and editor and
                    wonderful conversationalist. It was a real privilege to spend an evening with
                    him and talk to him. And of course everybody who was in India then wanted to
                    meet Nehru which we did several times. Well not several times. My husband many
                    times and I very often at National Day celebrations and very often when
                    Ambassador and Mrs. Bunker might have been out of the country, then we were
                    standing in for them you see at receptions or whatnot. Public dinners.</p>
                <p>Then I remember dozens of very ordinary conversations and meetings with local
                    officials whose names I can't remember now. One terribly interesting evening
                    with the leading manufacturing family of India, the Tata family. I think they're
                    the wealthiest family in India.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>And then another visit to a dam and that is the most interesting thing in the
                    world to see in India. To see them building a dam because it's all done by hand.
                    And there were Indian women walking with stones in baskets on their heads up a
                    steep incline like ants. We saw several dams being built. My husband was always
                    very interested in the progress, great progress being made by all these things.
                    We visited one dam where the chief engineer was an American whom the Indians had
                    hired to come over and build their dam. Very interesting. He explained how you
                    put up the cement blocks and then you do a great deal of grouting. That's where
                    I learned that word. Grouting the cement in-between the stones and so on. And
                    then we had lunch at his house with him and I said, “I can't get over this. This
                    tastes like totally American food.” And he said, “That's just what it is. I
                    refuse to eat Indian food and every single thing I eat comes out of a can and I
                    order it from America.” So we had canned luncheon meat, canned bread, canned
                    peaches for dessert, canned everything. I'll never forget it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the gentleman who came .. ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: This was an American. I can't remember his name, but he was building a
                    huge dam for the Indians. There were a lot of minor episodes I won't go into.
                    (End of Tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Brown, we were talking about India and I was hoping
                        maybe you could talk a little bit more about the post as the wife of a DCM
                        in India. You've mentioned that you traveled a lot. What about just within
                        the embassy as the DCM's wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I saw my particular job as simply being helpful in any way I could
                    be to Mrs. Bunker, the ambassador's wife. I had a very nice talk with her when
                    we first arrived, that how happy I would be to do anything I could to help her
                    or spare her. It's a difficult life there in that the heat is trying. I don't
                    know how old she was. She was certainly older than I and I thought that she
                    certainly needed help at certain times. She was a lovely person and very
                    appreciative and I think I was helpful to her in going and doing certain things.
                    It was easier for me to do them, shall I say, than for her.</p>
                <p>And then as far as I was concerned, I did nothing that any other embassy wife
                    would do other than trying to get to know all the other wives and be friends
                    with the other wives, be helpful wherever possible or needful. I did several
                    volunteer jobs because I wanted to in the first place, and in the second place,
                    I wanted to set an example to other wives. Not to just sit at home and stay out
                    of the heat. And because you see for the first time many of them had servants
                    who had never had servants before in their lives. And it gave them plenty of
                    free time to do things. Do volunteer work.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. So you felt that your relationship with both the
                        ambassador's wife and also the younger wives was pretty good and you might
                        be acting actually as a mediator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went on to Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. We were in India for three years from '57 to '60. And in
                    1960, President Kennedy was elected and appointed my husband ambassador to
                    Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was that like? Now you have moved up to
                        ambassador's wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. It was a very trying situation for me in that he was called home on
                    consultation after his appointment and I had to stay there with the children and
                    was desperately in need of new clothes, having worn the same old cotton dresses
                    for the last three years and we were going to still another hot climate. And I
                    couldn't leave the children and he said, “Don't you worry. I'll do the shopping
                    for you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was he going to do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He was going to do it here in Washington. I told him more or less what I
                    wanted and needed and he was here, I think, six weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Quite a long time. Well the situation was very dicey in East Asia at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the beginning of the war? Vietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BROWN: The very beginning of the real trouble. I guess it was the seed of the
                    Vietnam War. And here he was, he had to learn about a whole new area, you see,
                    that he'd never worked in before. And so he had a tremendous amount of briefing
                    he had to go through from the CIA, and the Defense Department, the State
                    Department, everything. So he finally came back and we left Delhi. By that time
                    I had become quite fond of the place, to tell you the truth. That's the way. You
                    make friends and everything is familiar and you understand everything and the
                    household is running smoothly and everybody's crying because you're going and
                    all that kind of thing. So it's inevitable. Even though I didn't like it at the
                    beginning, when you finally leave, you're sad about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's good to know. It's encouraging to me!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. But if you'd ask me to go back and do it all over again, I'd
                    say, “Thank you but no thank you.” Once was enough. But I'm very glad that we
                    did it. I feel sorry for people who have never lived in Asia or never lived in
                    that part of the world. If they've only known Europe or South America, they
                    don't really know how the world is is the way I feel. Well, so we arrived in
                    Laos in July again. (laughter) Arrived by way of Bangkok because you fly to
                    Bangkok and then you have to take a little - I think we went up in the embassy
                    plane to Vientiane, the capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've noticed that they've changed the name since
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Really?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They still show it on the map on my big atlas, but in
                        parenthesis. I'm trying to remember what the current name is. Because I had
                        to look that up for Mary Louise's interview. She mentioned Vientiane
                        also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh really? I didn't know they changed the name. It's like the new name for
                    Burma. I can't remember those names.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Myanmar? So in other words, the consultation happened just
                        before you left India. Your husband came back to the States for ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BROWN: He came here on consultation and then came back to India and picked us up
                    and then we went on to Laos. Well Bangkok first for overnight, and then to Laos
                    the next day. That was quite frankly something that took getting used to. A very
                    small town, it's a very small country and once again I went through culture
                    shock. A small residence for the ambassador which was desperately was in need of
                    re-painting and re-decorating or something. All the rooms were dark and
                    gloomy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was there before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A man named Horace Smith whom I don't know at all. I've only met him once.
                    And his wife, his wife was there. I met her here, but honestly I wouldn't know
                    her if I saw her. I met her long after we came back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So here you are in Laos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, and now an ambassador's wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That didn't feel any different from anything else. I didn't feel any great
                    charge or excitement or anything, I think chiefly because everything was on such
                    a small scale. It was disappointing, if I could put it that way. If you're
                    socially ambitious and wanted a glamorous diplomatic life, well forget it if
                    you're going to go to Vientiane because it's not that way.</p>

                <p>BROWN: A different world, but a huge American contingent there. A great big USOM

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: USAIIn a little primitive country like this, building bridges, putting a
                    well in a village, all those very small - not everything very small - but just
                    from the lowest level trying to improve the lives. We seemed to have an awful
                    lot of people there doing it because all the dependents were there - wives and
                    children. Then there was a huge MAAG contingent - military assistance. And their
                    wives and their children. In fact I think there were more Americans there than
                    there were Laotians for something that seemed to me just enormous. Because we
                    hadn't had any of that stuff in India it seemed. Well, no, we had a big U.S. AID
                    mission, but we didn't have military. In India, we didn't have the military
                    period. In fact the embassy Marines weren't even allowed to wear their uniforms
                    in India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? How interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They wore civilian clothes. Indians were non-aligned, you see. They wanted
                    no evidence of U.S. military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An interesting point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: So there we were in Laos and I started making all my official calls to the
                    foreign ministers' wives. Oh, my French was practically non-existent and ever
                    since we'd gotten news of this assignment, I'd been having French lessons every
                    morning at 7:30 in New Delhi which was obviously not going to enable me to speak
                    French, but was going to help me get started and keep me going because French is
                    the language in Laos. Leftover by the French. So I started making my calls and
                    being entertained. Almost every night there was a reception. The head of MAAG
                    (military assistance group) and his wife, the head of USOM and his wife, all
                    these things that you do at the beginning at a new post. And all just terribly
                    confusing. New names, new everything. And terrible heat all the time. Constant
                    heat.</p>
                <p>And maybe only two weeks passed when the phone rang one night and it was the DCM
                    whose name was John Holt calling to tell my husband that there was artillery
                    fire near his house and what he said I think is happening is that a coup is
                    taking place. And that proved to be true. A Laotian army captain named Kong Le
                    wanted to overthrow the government. And so from then on, all social life
                    ceased.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was how long after you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BROWN: About two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two weeks!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The firing wasn't annihilating or anything like that. It was just sporadic
                    and irritating and nobody knew really what was going to happen and how serious
                    it was and so forth and so on. The Laotians are fierce fighters but they aren't
                    very skilled and their aim was very bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughs) It sounds funny, but I'm sure it was not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They weren't out to kill the Americans, but they could just simply aim the
                    guns the wrong way and hit an American building, you see, and they later did
                    almost destroy the American Embassy. So my husband got more and more worried
                    about all these women and children you see, with the fighting going on all
                    around the town. He didn't want to evacuate everyone because that would look
                    like we were frightened, you see. What he wanted to do was play down this whole
                    coup and say, “Oh this is just a minor skirmish. It's not really war, and it
                    will all die away.” Except it didn't die away. I think he was terrified that a
                    dependent, a wife or a child, would be hit by a stray bullet and killed.</p>
                <p>One great and fortunate thing happened which was that, being the rainy season
                    once again, monsoon season, the river, the Mekong River, which runs between
                    Thailand and Laos, began to rise because it poured rain incessantly and it rose
                    and it rose and it rose and it came up the banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a pretty big river.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: And, ha, the perfect solution. It was announced that the city of Vientiane
                    was in danger of being flooded so therefore the dependents were being evacuated
                    because of the flood. So we were all evacuated to Bangkok with the idea that
                    once either the flood was over or the river had gone down and the fighting had
                    ceased, peace had been made between Kong Le and the Laotian government with
                    their three or four princes, Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince General Phoumi
                    Nosavan - a can of worms. I wouldn't even begin to go into it. Once peace had
                    been made we would all come back. Well, it wasn't made. And it dragged on and on
                    and on. So I lived in Bangkok for two years with the children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you really?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. With all the other wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's amazing. Just waiting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Waiting. At first we thought, well surely we'll come back. We lived in
                    hotels and time passed and no, it wasn't safe to come back, no, no. Well I
                    didn't see my husband for three months. He didn't get down to Bangkok for three
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you first were evacuated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. And then it became obvious that we weren't going to go back at all.
                    First I got an apartment which was kind of grungy. Not ambassadorial at all!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's worse now, Bangkok.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Is it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I was there last year. Pretty bad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Really? For the poor Bangkok embassy we were like “The Man Who Came to
                    Dinner,” you know, and then just never left. They didn't know what to do with us
                    after a while. Well in fact, sort of ignored us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in charge of the post in Bangkok?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well Alex Johnson was ambassador there, but we weren't his responsibility.
                    We were the U.S. government, you know. He had his own problems without looking
                    after us. So then just by the process of attrition, their tour being up, people
                    began going home, so there were fewer and fewer wives left in Bangkok, although
                    still quite a number. I was the “mother” waiting in the hospital corridor for at
                    least three children to be born. You know, young wives whose husbands were up in
                    Laos or something like that. I did my best to kind of keep some kind of . .
                    .Although I scarcely knew any of them. And they didn't know me. I'd only been
                    there for two weeks. I remember the day we were evacuated, the embassy clerk or
                    whoever she was said, “What did you say your name was?” I said, “Brown.” She
                    said, “How do you spell it?” “BROWN.” And she said, “And what does your husband
                    do?” Well you know, it was that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Laos or Bangkok?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: This was in Vientiane as we were being evacuated. It was all done very
                    efficiently, awfully well done. She didn't mean anything. She just had never
                    heard of me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hadn't been there that long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. After a year, by just the greatest stroke of luck, a couple - he
                    wasn't in the embassy in Bangkok, but they were with the USAID mission, I think.
                    They had a very nice house right there in that area that's sort of the embassy
                    area. Ruam Rudie was the name of the street. A furnished house which they had
                    been living in. I didn't know her at all well - I'd only met her once. But she
                    was a very good friend of very good friends of mine in the Bangkok embassy. And
                    she felt sorry for me. And she said her house was owned by a prince. I think
                    they've got a lot of princes in Bangkok. And it wasn't grand or palatial, but it
                    was extremely comfortable and pleasant. And she told him that she wanted him
                    particularly to let the house to me. Not to let it to anybody else. Nobody even
                    knew that the house was for rent except myself. And that's how I got the house
                    and from then on life improved enormously because I had two
                    air-conditioners!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's really important in Bangkok!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In fact two air-conditioners, one for each of the bedrooms so the children
                    had one. You know how terrible the mosquitos are there. And the house even came
                    staffed with a houseboy and his wife. Who did the cooking or what, I don't know,
                    but anyway I had a couple, and life became immeasurably better. And I said, “I'm
                    just going to forget about going to Vientiane, I'm going to just concentrate on
                    doing something to help everybody's morale,” including my own. Well, much
                    earlier than that with a couple of the other Laos wives we had got a school
                    going for our children and got my husband to send down all the school books from
                    Vientiane. Of course all the teachers were still there, they were all American
                    wives. So we got a place and got a school going, a regular structured
                    schedule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BROWN: Oh yes. It was the best thing that we could have done. And since now
                    finally I had a place to do it, I went to a couple of the local hospitals and
                    explained my situation and said, here we were, a group of women and I thought it
                    would be a very good thing if we all had some kind of work to do on a regular
                    basis. And if possible, because we had no transportation, nobody had a car you
                    see, we could do it at my house. They could get together in pedicabs or cabs or
                    something and come to my house once a week. You know how houses in Bangkok have
                    the ground floor which is open to the air. What's that called, I've
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know if they have a special name, in Thai I'm
                        sure. Sort of like a courtyard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, roof and whatnot and furniture on it. No walls. And one hospital
                    said, “Well that would be just wonderful!” They gave us bolts of muslin,
                    unbleached muslin. I can still see those bolts of material. I can't sew, but one
                    of the other wives said, “Sure, let me do it.” They lent us a sewing machine and
                    they took turns on the sewing machine and we met once a week and we made sheets,
                    I guess, for the hospital. And the hospital would come and pick them up every
                    week and deliver the supplies.</p>
                <p>And it turned out to be very nice. We had ice tea and cookies and everybody got
                    to see each other once a week and we kept up. You know, who is sick, who is
                    well, who is very depressed, who needs cheering up. They were a great group of
                    women. I was terribly proud of them. There was no alcoholism, no whining, no
                    anything. Maybe if there was, they kept it to themselves. I would not have same
                    women every week, but everybody knew the day and they were free to come if they
                    wanted to come. Twenty, thirty people maybe, something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many were there in total?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh quite a number at the very beginning. Total number of dependents. I
                    would hate to hazard a guess. I would say roughly maybe 200.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow, that's quite a large number to be evacuated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: From a little town like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the children manage throughout this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BROWN: The children were very good. Of course women, American women - I beg your
                    pardon - but all women are quite resourceful when something like this happens.
                    The ones with very small children got together and had a little play school. You
                    know, took turns having all the children to play. And as I said with the older
                    children, we started the school for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your built your own support group yourselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. We just did it. And it was as much for all of us. Kept us
                    busy, kept us occupied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't suppose there was training for this before you
                        went to Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. I didn't expect any. I frankly hated that whole time in Bangkok. I
                    really did because I was there with no purpose in life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Much different from the usual diplomatic life that you
                        were used to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: And no diplomatic colony or anything. Quite a switch from London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I guess also the uncertainly added to the
                        anguish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in the end you just stayed on until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Until '62. Until a new ambassador was appointed. I think it certainly was
                    high time because I think my husband probably aged ten years in that time. It
                    was terribly hard on him. A lot of sixteen, eighteen hour days and cables back
                    and forth. Would there be war, wouldn't there? And Kennedy took an intense
                    interest in it. And Governor Harriman was assistant secretary for far east
                    affairs, and of course he and Win were old friends from London days. He came
                    over two or three times. It was very much of a hot topic in Washington at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: What was the best stance to take? To send in American troops or not. And
                    my husband was strongly, strongly opposed to doing that.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh yes. To American intervention. He said, “Let us do everything possible
                    to get the parties right here to sit down and negotiate, but don't send in
                    troops and don't. . . . Of course other people, I don't know for sure, but I
                    imagine the military people said, “Gung ho. Let's go in there.” Just the way
                    Vietnam started. Send in advisors and then send in troops and then so and so on
                    and you know how that escalated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's tough. I guess Ambassador Brown didn't have any
                        idea at all what he was getting into when he got assigned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He knew from what he had been told here that there might be. I mean the
                    trouble was brewing under the surface. There could be trouble at some point. But
                    I don't think he had any idea that it would be as bad. At one point the MAAG
                    chief burst into his office and said, “Get the hell out of here. Right now!” And
                    Win said, “Why? What's the problem?” He said, “Don't talk. Get out, get out.”
                    And two minutes later his office was hit by a shell and his desk destroyed and
                    everything. He would have been killed. It was a very strange period. Finally
                    they sent out everybody. They sent the secretaries and spent hours burning
                    papers, embassy papers. You know all the mechanics of getting ready to abandon
                    an embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that would have been '62. But the new ambassador was
                        assigned, you said?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well the new ambassador didn't come until we left and who was he? I'll
                    tell you who he was. Leonard Unger who had been DCM in Bangkok. And they were
                    wonderfully kind to me all the time we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then they had been there in that area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh yes. He later became ambassador to Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we have just finished with Laos and we're moving on to
                        '62 to '64. And you returned to the States. Ambassador Brown went to the
                        National War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. He was the deputy commandant representing the State
                    Department at the War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What exactly does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There's a deputy commandant for the Navy and the Army and the Air Force
                    and the State Department. And they all either teach courses or they supervise
                    courses or they bring in speakers for the students who are at the War College.
                    And one lives at Ft. McNair, so that's where we lived for two years. That's
                    Southwest Washington. Down near the. . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Navy Yard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not that far. Well you go past the Arena Theater. It's very close to
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now you're back from a terrible experience in Laos and
                        Bangkok.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In a funny way back in Washington, but not of Washington. Not living in
                    town, living on a military post in town, but not what you call a normal
                    Washington life because our whole purpose of the War College is not only to
                    train the best and the brightest as they like to think of themselves, upcoming
                    young officers, but to have them get to know each other. The different services.
                    Learn to know each other and each other's problems. Become friends because it is
                    expected that the CIA man and the Navy man might possibly serve together in a
                    future post. Well great. Here they've had that two years together at the War
                    College and have become friends. It's to break down barriers in the
                    services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they can work together better in the future.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Work together and understand each other better and understand each other's
                    problems and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your husband teach any courses there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: You know I can't remember exactly. He gave talks on things that he was a
                    specialist in and things he knew about. One of the chief things he did was to
                    get speakers from the State Department. An ambassador who was back here on
                    consultation who was involved in some current very interesting problem. He'd
                    have him come and talk and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well his whole experience in Laos would have been very,
                        very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BROWN: It was, I'm sure it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well I was replenishing my wardrobe for one thing. (laughter) And keeping
                    house, quite frankly, because I didn't have much household help. I had a woman
                    who sometimes came and sometimes didn't. This is something that - here I'm
                    talking. I'm not complaining, I'm not criticizing. The military have a great
                    advantage over civilians in the service in that everyone wanted those. . . .
                    Have you ever seen those houses at Ft. McNair? It's called the “General's
                    Row.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They're lovely old houses with white pillars. It's like Ft. Myer. They're
                    red brick with big white pillars and they're very handsome, very dignified. And
                    every military wife has an aide or two assigned to do housework, cooking,
                    cleaning, etc., etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not bad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: But not the State Department. And of course we entertained. What we were
                    there for was to get to know the military ourselves at our level. So we
                    entertained quite a good deal. So somebody had to produce it. That was I did a
                    great deal of the time. I always had to do it properly of course and get
                    somebody to wait table and all that kind of thing. Win would have, as I told
                    you, a speaker come from the Department, particularly somebody who was
                    newsworthy or somebody who was right up to the minute on some particular problem
                    to talk to the students. And then bring him and about ten of the students back
                    to the house for lunch. And the students just all loved that because it was a
                    change from the cafeteria. And they would have a martini or two I guess. Anyway,
                    the bar was there, they could have whatever they wanted and sit down and eat
                    lunch. This would be eight or ten of the young officers plus the speaker of the
                    day and my husband. And I did the lunch. I did not serve it, I did not appear.
                    It was served buffet style. I cooked it. Well it kept me kind of busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Especially when you were used to having some help in India
                        and also in Vientiane. In Bangkok you had a little help also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was back down to earth.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a good time for you though?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was. It's a lovely place to live down there. It's very quiet. Of course
                    the three children were in school and that helps a lot. Taking care of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time did the children say much about their
                        experiences overseas? Did they talk much about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, I think the biggest thrill of their whole lives occurred when they got
                    back to Washington and they saw a TV for the first time in their lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? How old were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well my son was about fourteen and the next daughter would have been about
                    twelve and the youngest was ten, maybe, nine. They'd never seen TV before. I
                    think that hit them more than anything. Plus all the goodies that you have to
                    eat and drink in the United States which we certainly didn't have in Bangkok. I
                    remember we stopped in Hawaii on our way back and I think I ate a head of
                    lettuce everyday. I hadn't had any lettuce for four years. You see I'd been out
                    of the country for four years. Just stupid things like that were just
                    marvelous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peanut M &amp; M's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the children didn't have any trouble integrating into
                        the schools there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes I've heard that when they try to explain their
                        experiences to their peers, they have a little trouble because they didn't
                        share the same experiences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. Well if the children did, they never told me about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in London they were too young to be going to

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well they went to pre-school. And in India they were going to the
                    International School. And in Laos they obviously weren't doing much for two
                    weeks and then they had your school in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October 25, 1992. This is Monique Wong and I'm
                        interviewing Mrs. Peggy Ann Brown at her home for the Foreign Service Spouse
                        Oral History. This is Tape II, Side A. So here we are. We're at the end of
                        1964, I guess and you're getting ready to go to Seoul as an ambassador's
                        wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. To tell you the truth that was something of a
                    disappointment, to me anyway. While we were at Ft. McNair, we decided to spend
                    our leisure time house hunting. While we were in London, we had sold the house
                    we had lived in in Washington. And we spent I can't tell you how many weeks and
                    months looking at houses until the real estate agent must have been ready to
                    kill us by the time we had traipsed in and out of all the different houses. But
                    I knew exactly what I wanted and was willing to just keep on looking until we
                    found it. I wanted a house in town close by a bus stop for the children to use
                    the bus and for a cleaning woman to come by bus. I did not want Georgetown. I
                    didn't want this, that or the other thing.</p>
                <p>But anyway, we looked and looked and we finally found a house on Tracy Place
                    which was exactly perfect for our needs. It had the right number of bedrooms,
                    right size. We had this funny old-fashioned furniture which required fairly big
                    rooms to put it in. All of which had been in storage for - well, all these
                    years. So we bought it. And then because - I'm trying to think which came first
                    - whether we rented it. No, we didn't. We bought it and then Win was told that
                    he was appointed ambassador to Korea. So what to do with the house? We couldn't
                    move into it. After so long I was just desperately anxious to have one place we
                    could call home, so when the children said, “Where's home?” I could say, “Home
                    is Washington and this is the house that we will live in.”</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So then in great haste, we had to rent the house before we left for Korea and
                    rented it to a terribly nice family. He was an assistant secretary in the
                    Commerce Department. They came from New York and they wanted the house on one
                    condition, that we put the carpets down and the draperies and washing machine,
                    dryer, so on and so forth, terrace furniture. It had a nice terrace in the back.
                    It's just over here about two blocks. Which makes sense. He knew that he wasn't
                    going to be there forever. He was only going to be there for maybe two years.
                    You wouldn't want to have draperies made or buy rugs for a house or something.
                    So it made sense to us so we said, “Lord, okay, let's go and buy rugs for the
                    house and all these other things.” And I had, while we were in India, bought
                    Indian raw silk for a non-existent house. Once we were on a trip in some part of
                    India and went to a factory, a mill where raw silk was made and exported and
                    dyed after it gets to this country.Or sent to somewhere. So I bought enough raw
                    silk for an imaginary house, a living room, a dining room and I didn't know what
                    else. So I had that made up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What color?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: If I'd had time I would have chosen a color more-or-less this color, but I
                    didn't have time and I just had it made up as it was so it's just sort of a
                    creamy beige color.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The natural color for raw silk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: And we went to Woodward and Lothrop and bought all the carpeting for the
                    downstairs and some of the upstairs rooms and also in India, I bought - I spent
                    a lot of time daydreaming while speeches were going on in some Indian dialect. I
                    bought carpet, cotton rugs at another factory that we visited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dhurries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. And of course they were very cheap there. And I had some furniture
                    made in India, copies of pieces that were in the house that the embassy had
                    furnished. And I was furnishing an imaginary house. Three bedrooms for three
                    children and so on. So anyway, it all got done and we left for Korea and had
                    three wonderfully happy years there. People say it's the best kept secret in the
                    Foreign Service what a great post it is. Well it certainly was in our day. It
                    has a wonderful climate, wonderfully warm, cheerful, friendly people. A real
                    delight to work with and live with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It gets cool in the winter though, doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BROWN: It has a climate very much like Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did you get any sort of training? I remember you had
                        some French before you went to Laos from India, but there was really nothing
                        for an ambassador's wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well the Foreign Service Institute never said “boo” to me about it. I
                    would have gone to classes or whatever, but nobody ever said to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know they have something for ambassadors' wives
                        now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well it's since my day. It didn't exist in my day. Well we studied Korean
                    when we got there. We had lessons every morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now you actually have a proper embassy and you have a
                        staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A wonderful staff, and I give all thanks to my predecessor, Sam Berger and
                    Margie Berger. I don't know if you ever heard of them. And he was very good and
                    she was a very intelligent woman and whether it was she who trained the
                    servants, I really don't know, but they were just absolutely first-class and we
                    were terribly spoiled for three years with good help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very busy socially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, terribly busy socially because of not only social life with the
                    Koreans, but visitors from Washington constantly. Senators or Representatives.
                    So many were coming to Japan, for instance, and so they came to Korea on the way
                    or something. And then, once again, you had a huge military presence there and a
                    great part of our job was living happily with all the military. The generals and
                    the admirals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, we had in the embassy our own attach�s. But the whole military complex
                    there is just huge, you see. We have 40,000 troops there, don't we? Something
                    like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know. A large number I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BROWN: So we had generals and generals' wives and admirals and admirals' wives.
                    There had to be an awful lot of socializing and. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keeping everybody happy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, not particularly. They didn't need to be kept happy. But keeping good
                    relations. Let's just put it that way. Not only good relations with the Koreans,
                    but good relations with the Americans there because the whole military presence
                    is so powerful and takes itself very seriously. And should be taken seriously.
                    And they aren't always used to dealing with an embassy or an ambassador or
                    something. Sometimes I imagine they're kind of suspicious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess they're the soldiers and you're the diplomats. Not
                        quite the same.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right, no. So you had that enormous segment. And so many of my
                    Foreign Service wives are astounded when I mention USOM or MAAG or something.
                    They say, “What on earth are you talking about?” You know they've lived in posts
                    that didn't have anything like that. There was just a U.S. embassy, period.
                    Nothing else. Except maybe USIA or something. But here again, we had this huge
                    military presence. And then a huge AID mission, USOM, in Korea. I don't know how
                    many wives, but very strong-minded wives and not about to be considered
                    second-class citizens or anything like that. And they had to be kept happy as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was part of your job as the ambassador's
                        wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. To try to make everybody one big happy family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a big task.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The military wives had a luncheon once a month at the officer's club and
                    the USOM wives had a luncheon once a month at the USOM club. And then we had an
                    embassy wives meeting once a month. I was chairman by tradition of the local
                    children's hospital committee and had to get very much involved in that. I just
                    can't tell you all. I had never been as busy in my life as I was then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what about within the embassy? I guess as the wife of
                        a new Foreign Service officer, I'm sort of interested from your perspective
                        as the ambassador's wife looking now at the new people who were starting to
                        come. Were they something that you were impressed with or unhappy with in
                        particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BROWN: I know one thing. This harks back to Bangkok. There was a situation there
                    where the ambassador's wife was quite arbitrary in her decisions. She would say
                    to somebody, “I want you to be chairman of our YWCA booth at the bazaar this
                    coming fall,” and this wife would say, “Oh but please, I've just finished such
                    and such a job. I feel I really just can't spare the time. Couldn't somebody
                    else do it?” And she'd say, “No, I want you to do it.” And she was also given to
                    things like calling up wives on a Sunday afternoon and saying, “I want you to
                    come over and play bridge,” when they had other plans and they didn't want to
                    play bridge, but they had to go and play bridge.</p>
                <p>All that kind of thing I was very much aware of and I always thought that was the
                    most terrible thing I ever heard of. So I was determined not to ever be that
                    way, and in particular because there were a couple of younger wives in Korea who
                    were studying. One was training to be a doctor. One was studying by
                    correspondence, I think, I can't remember what. And I said to both of them,
                    separately. I talked to them and I said, “What you are doing is more important
                    than wives' affairs, coffee and tea parties and things like that. Don't feel you
                    ever, ever have to drop something to come here.” I felt very strongly about
                    this. And I felt that way about evening parties, too. I didn't think that a wife
                    ought to have to go to a cocktail party or a reception at the embassy simply
                    because she and her husband had been invited, particularly if she had little
                    children and was having a problem about being out too much and she felt the
                    children needed her at home. Way back when I first got to London, when the
                    children weren't even adjusted yet, I used to have to drop everything and go to
                    someplace to a lunch leaving a crying child at home. I can still remember that
                    and how much I hated it.</p>
                <p>Well anyway, to make a long story short, I think that one thing - I didn't start
                    it. This was an idea of a USIA officer's wife. It was her idea and she came and
                    asked me if I would help with it. And I think it was one of the best things that
                    happened in Korea. She wanted to get out what she called a little newsletter and
                    hopefully rather like a magazine. It would be in English for all the hundreds of
                    American women living in Seoul, the military and the USOM, plus the Korean women
                    who had lived in the United States and spoke English who would love to have
                    something like an American magazine. And this magazine would contain a garden
                    article, an article on Korean recipes to be adapted to American taste, an
                    article on Korean history making it interesting or a trip to someplace in Korea.
                    And the whole thing to carry advertising which would make the magazine support
                    itself. You would give the magazine away. The advertising would pay for the
                    printing and whatnot and if there was any profit left over, the money would go
                    to charity, Korean charity.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Well, last I heard, it's still going. And it was a great success. And one of the
                    best parts about it was that so many women turned out to have so much talent.
                    Here's all this untapped talent. Women who could write. There was a book review
                    every month. Women who could do very amusing things. One woman was a born
                    salesperson. She went out and sold advertising and had a wonderful time! To
                    Korean hairdressers and brass makers and antique dealers and things like this.
                    This gave everybody something to do. And the Korean women loved the
                    magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't really that strict with the officers or
                        their wives that they have to be doing a certain amount of entertaining or
                        attending parties, that they could do other things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They could do their own thing. Anyway, I think it was a success. I never
                    told anybody. Well I was told that I had to do certain things in London. I
                    remember that vividly. I never ever did it myself, told anybody what to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's good to know. Do you think that's true with other
                        ambassadors' wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Gosh Monique, I've been away from it so long now and haven't traveled
                    around in embassies, so I haven't really been able to observe what's going on
                    these days. But my daughter has never complained about anything like that. She's
                    been in two very small posts, so I don't really know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she's married to a Foreign Service officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. I think maybe I could be accused . . . . I never heard anything about
                    it, but of course you don't hear about things like that, but we had a
                    presidential visit while we were in Seoul. President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson
                    and an entourage. It was a trip he made where he went all around Asia. He went
                    to New Zealand, Australia, he did the whole swing around the Pacific. Probably
                    the Philippines first and so on. Did the whole swing around the Pacific and his
                    last stop was Korea.</p>
                <p>Of course at every president's visit, the host country entertains him at a dinner
                    or a something. And then the President entertains the president of the country.
                    He gives a party. Only he doesn't lift a finger. It's the poor old women in the
                    embassy who put on the party. It was decided that the party would be at a great
                    big place outside of Seoul, about as far as from here to Bethesda, at kind of a
                    - not a resort, but a place that Koreans like to go to. It had a huge
                    auditorium. It was a convention center sort of thing. Huge auditorium and a
                    restaurant and all kinds of things attached to it. The party was given in the
                    auditorium ballroom. I don't know if you call it a ballroom.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Major event.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: And bare as a bone. Not very attractive, not very anything. So I had to
                    start with somebody. I started with the senior wives. I said, “Okay, please help
                    me. Let's all go out there. We've got to take this room and turn it into
                    something that looks glamorous like a party room or something.” And we did. We
                    had two weeks to do it in. But the Koreans were just simply marvelous. They are
                    wonderful people. They will knock themselves out to do something overnight for
                    you. They have beautiful silks, you know, like Thai silk. And we had big round
                    tables scattered around the room with gold silk cloths going down to the floor.
                    I've got all the pictures of all that stuff. And in the middle of the table a
                    tall brass, very high candlestick, you see, with a thick candle in the middle
                    and flowers around the base. Against the wall, sofas and greenery and screens.
                    You know, Koreans have thousands of screens that they're dying to sell. Antique
                    dealers. Incidentally, many screens and much brass was sold to the Johnson
                    group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like these you have here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We put up the screens to hide these ugly bare walls. And then up on the
                    receiving line, we lined the whole back of it with evergreen trees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow! What an effort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: What an effort. I never will forget it. But all right, everybody worked
                    like dogs. Maybe they resented it. I worked harder than anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you needed the help, though. I mean you couldn't
                        have done it by yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: So at times like that, you just say, “I'm sorry, girls, I need help.” And
                    if you can say, “Oh pooh, I don't want to help you.” If they could say that to
                    me, and I'd say, “Okay, don't bother. But you're kind of missing out on the fun
                    if you don't do something.” That's the thing, Monique. If you say, “I'm not
                    going to take part in any embassy activity, I'm not going to the silly cocktail
                    parties. I've got better things to do.” Well all right, you're kind of cutting
                    off your nose to spite your face because if you'd go to the cocktail party, you
                    might meet some terribly interesting Greek, we'll say. Or make a new friend or
                    something like that. You can figure you're helping yourself. You're not doing it
                    just to make the ambassador happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you feel, though, if the wife came to you and
                        said, “Mrs. Brown, do you need any help with anything?” Would you feel
                        positive or negative about that? You know sometimes you don't want to
                        appear, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well I think I'd say, “Thank you so much for even thinking of it. Of
                    course there will be times where I'll need help. I'll let you know.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes I feel that as a new person, they want to be a
                        little bit careful about things like that. They don't want to appear to be

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I understand what you mean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . please the ambassador even though you'd really like
                        to be doing something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It becomes pretty clear, Monique, what kind of a person you are in an
                    embassy. If you're obviously cheerful and willing and friendly to the Greeks and
                    can speak a little Greek, the ambassador is going to notice it, his wife is
                    going to notice it. Don't worry, she will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No I'm not worried. I've heard other people mention this.
                        That's why I pose the question. Then after Korea, you're back in the States
                        for a number of years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. I'm trying to think what my husband did then. He spent one
                    year. . .Johnson asked him to be a representative to all the governors of the 50
                    states. Was that then or was that some other time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well he did that for a year, but I can't remember when that was. Maybe
                    that was right after Fort McNair. But he came back and worked with Marshall
                    Green. He was deputy assistant secretary for Far East affairs and worked with
                    Marshall Green and Bill Bundy. And then retired. By that time he knew he had
                    Parkinson's and knew he had to retire. There was no question of another
                    assignment abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't going overseas anymore. Just one last thing.
                        We kind of mentioned one of your children had married a Foreign Service
                        officer. I am interested in hearing a little bit about their views on the
                        Foreign Service, being children who had traveled so much.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well first of all they say they both very much enjoy meeting foreigners
                    and making friends and so forth. That doesn't faze them no matter what country
                    they're sent to. But on the other hand, Anne has told me that every now and then
                    she gets so tired of the effort of making friends and she wishes that she were
                    right here in the United States building friendships with people that she would
                    see forever on a regular basis. But, I don't know. The trouble with the Foreign
                    Service is there are so many invisible things you get from it. A kind “invisible
                    salary” I've always called it. Kind of a plus just from living in a foreign
                    country and knowing foreign people. And I've always frankly felt sorry for
                    friends of whom I have many who have never spoken to a foreigner, practically,
                    except on a trip to Europe. To the hotel man or the train conductor or something
                    like that. And I think my life is much richer than theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your other two children? Do they ever mention
                        wanting to go into the Foreign Service at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh no. My son, the oldest, is a lawyer here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Following in his father's footsteps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He took the Foreign Service exam just to see if he could pass it and he
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course he did. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: And then the oldest daughter, Julia, is married to an artist and they live
                    in Arizona and travel back and forth to Ireland and Europe and everywhere else.
                    I think all the children, if you asked them, would probably say they're very
                    glad of their Foreign Service experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have been.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't know. I've never really asked them or talked to them about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I think we have finally come to the end. . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: You've gotten to the bottom of the barrel, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh well, there are a lot more things that I would like to
                        ask, actually. I could go on and on. Thank you very, very much. I really
                        appreciate this opportunity to talk to you and learn from you. Your
                        experiences and everything. It's also encouraging to hear the good
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There are good things and bad things and I think the good things outweigh
                    the bad things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good! Well shall we stop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: All right, fine.</p>
