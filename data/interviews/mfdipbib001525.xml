                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This interview with Prudence Bushnell is being done on
                        behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Today is the 21st of July, 2005. You go by Pru?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Let's start at the beginning. Could you tell
                        when and where you were born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I was born in Washington, DC in 1946.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Let's talk a bit first on your father's side,
                        then your mother's side. What do you know about the family? What was the
                        family name? Was it Bushnell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Bushnell, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you know about the Bushnell's as back a ways,
                        where they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: They were upright people of Scotch, Irish, Dutch and British decent. My
                    grandmother was smart, though not particularly well educated, and very active in
                    the temperance movement, WCTU, not to be confused with the women's movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The WCTU, the Women's Christian Temperance Unit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That's right. She had three children. Her husband died young.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: This and that. He was a small-time entrepreneur with mainly failing
                    businesses, including a bakery in the Catskills. He also ran a hack for awhile
                    and worked on the railroad. He died at the age of 40.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know if either of your grandparents went to college
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Neither of them did. Gram got an eighth-grade education. I'm not sure
                    what kind of education my grandfather got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: He got a college education. My grandmother made sure of that. My father
                    was the youngest of three, and there was a twelve-year difference between him
                    and the next sibling. So, he was the apple of her eye, a darling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She sounds like a pretty determined lady.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh yes, she was. My father, Gerry Bushnell, graduated from high school
                    in his home town, Oneonta, New York, and then went to Hartwick College where his
                    mother worked as the housemother of a sorority. Few jobs were available during
                    the Depression, so he continued his education at Syracuse University and got a
                    Masters in Education and then a Masters in Public Administration. It was there
                    that he met my mother, Bernice Duflwho went by the name of Dufie all her adult
                    life.</p>
                <p>My mother's father was a first-generation American. His father, a peasant farmer
                    came from Alsace Lorraine, was enticed to northern New York State with tales of
                    fertile land. What he found was mainly sand. Nonetheless, he married and, with
                    his hard working wife, supported eight healthy children on subsistence land
                    where the cash crop was maple syrup. That was it. One of those children was my
                    grandfather whose first ambition was to get the heck away from the farm. He only
                    had about four years of education but worked hard, like his father, and did well
                    for himself in the village of Lowville, New York.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I used to tell the story of his wife, my maternal grandmother, to high school
                    girls and women I would meet in rural Kenya and Guatemala as I did the circuit
                    promoting girls' education. I would relate that “my grandmother had to leave
                    school to work when she was 11 years old, because her father died and her mother
                    had absolutely no means of putting bread on the table any other way. She met my
                    grandfather and worked with him to fulfill a dream of owning their own shoe
                    store. From the money they made in the shoe store, they sent their only child,
                    my mother, to Syracuse University. There she met my father. He eventually joined
                    the Foreign Service, and she raised four children in various parts of world.
                    Today, my grandmother's granddaughter is a United States Ambassador.” At this
                    point I would get great applause from my female audience. “Stay in school,” I'd
                    admonish, “or help your girl child finish schooand someday you (or she) may be
                    the ambassador of your country.” That would draw more applause. Then when I
                    would introduce my husband, who usually traveled in country with me, as the
                    person who helps me, there'd be a standing ovation. For him, not for me. That's
                    OK. It was a wonderfully American story that women and girls in faraway places
                    could directly relate to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your grandmother doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: One job was separating laundry that came from farmers who neither
                    bathed nor changed their clothes very often. They could go through most of a
                    season before sending their clothes to be laundered. She hated that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's an old story about farmers would be sewn into
                        their union suits during the winter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. Years later she talked about how that was the worst job she'd
                    ever had. She also worked at a Five and Dime store — loved doing that. My
                    grandfather served as Deputy Sheriff, and worked on cars before they had enough
                    money to buy the shoe store.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For people who read this, you mentioned a Five and Dime
                        store. That was equivalent to a Woolworth's or a Kreskies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. Or the Dollar Store today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. I use to go to a Five and Dime store with nickels
                        and dimes and get things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right, because literally it was five and dime.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother and father met. Your father had gotten these
                        degrees and all, so what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: With a degree in public administration from Maxwell School, he found
                    work in the Albany, the New York State capitol and then was persuaded by members
                    of the group he hung out with, other young men, to come to Washington, D.C —
                    this was 1941. Now, imagine Washington in 1941. It was a boon town. Franklin
                    Delano Roosevelt had been in for a number of years, and the federal government
                    was “the” place to be. Degrees in public administration were brand new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the New Deal in essence was winding down, but we
                        were gearing up for the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: This was a time when public service was enormously respected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: And, Washington is where people went. That's where the jobs were; and
                    that's where the future was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This also was a time when the government girl was quite an
                        icon, because Washington had so many young women for the first time and
                        there were jobs opening up. Mainly, you might say the clerical level, but
                        often quite a bit of responsibility. The bureaucracy was growing
                        tremendously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. Mother also got a job in the federal government. She was a
                    secretary and then was the supervisor of a secretarial pool at OSS (Office of
                    Strategic Services), the fore-runner of the CIA, during World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Well, what did your father do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: First, he worked in price administration before being drafted into the
                    Army as so many men his age were. I'm not sure what he did he did in the
                    military. I know he went to Officers' Candidate School and never got overseas,
                    but I don't know much about that period of his life. He was not very keen on the
                    army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have brothers, sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I have one older sister and two younger brothers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, your family, would you consider yourself sort of a
                        Washingtonian? Was this where you grew up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. The story continues. The same group who persuaded my father to come
                    to Washington, convinced him to take a job as a civilian with the occupation
                    forces in Germany, in1948. So, off he went to work monetary policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is '48, was really the turnaround year. This is when
                        they had the currency reform, and we established a Western Deutschmark to
                        replace the old, inflationary Deutschmark. It was the blow that led to the
                        partition of Berlin..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. Dad went over first and left Mom to sell the house and bring his
                    mother (he always felt he owed his mother and could care less that Mom and she
                    never got along) and the two girlone, three years old, the other (me), eighteen
                    months old. Because Gram refused to fly, we went over on a troop carrier. Mom
                    would tell the story of the storms they encountered and of clutching one child
                    tightly as she used her leg to keep the crib with the other from careening
                    across the stateroom. In the overhead bunk, Gram remained sea sick for most of
                    the trip. It was a real adventure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Where did they settle in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Wherever the High Commission and, later, the embassy was located:
                    Frankfurt, Berlin, and then back to Frankfurt and ultimately, Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Those were my first childhood memories. I was seven years old we left
                    (1954). I remember orphans, particularly girls with big bows in their hair; men
                    with missing limbs; street cars; bombed-out buildings; and the smell of cement.
                    A few years ago, I had a conversation with a German man about my age. His
                    memories of that time were just the same. Lots of orphans; lots of people doing
                    menial work; lots of rubble and lots of rebuilding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall school there? What was school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. I recall first and second grade especially. We lived in a newly
                    constructed housing project in Bad Godesberg and attended a brand new school
                    situated on the Rhine River. It was wonderful to look out the window at the
                    river. We could walk home and lived in a very sheltered environment. I was in my
                    groove, I was in control. It was one of the most pleasant times of my childhood;
                    I was just a happy kid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little about the family. Did your mother and father have
                        politics? Was this something that you absorbed or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very strong politics. They were very strong Democrats, although their
                    parents had been equally strong Republicans. Later, Mom would talk about the
                    time Senator Joseph McCarthy's henchmen came to Germany and put my father in
                    their sights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Schine and Cohn came around. This is something anybody in
                        that era will never forget the impact of these two 20 year old kids running
                        around, basically pulling out books to burn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. Digging up dirt. And Dad had in his youth, in the '30s,
                    belonged to a college organization that had, in the eyes of the McCarthy people,
                    questionable ties. Mom and Dad kept the file of the questions he was asked and
                    the written statements he made. It was a very scary period that affected my
                    parents' friends and almost got my father kicked out of a job.</p>
                <p>I also remember conversations my parents had about the Holocaust, specifically
                    comments like, “I can't believe nobody knew this was going on.” There was a very
                    clear sense of outrage..</p>
                <p>O: Yeah. It was a period in Germany during which, any male you talked to said he
                    had fought on the Eastern front.</p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: My mother instilled in her children a strong sense of values about
                    other people. Europe during the fifties was filled with refugees, some working
                    as domestic staff. She would say to us, “Don't think that because these people
                    are working for us that they are not respectable and intelligent people.” I
                    became innately aware of the impact of war and how people had to struggle to
                    survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was religion part of your up-bringing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very much so. One grandmother, the Daughter of the American Revolution
                    and WCTU member was a staunch Methodist and my mother was raised a Catholic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Her parents wept at the news that Mom had decided to marry my father
                    who, with the arrogance of youth declared: “Religion will never enter my house.”
                    In point of fact, it did but in a very eclectic way. We went to
                    non-denominational Protestant churches, while my mother maintained a lot of
                    Catholic rituals, like foregoing meat on Fridays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a reader as a small kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Avid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall some of the things you read early on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I am of the Bobbsey Twins and Nancy Drew generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say to be a woman ambassador, I think you would
                        have read the entire Nancy Drew series. At least that's what I've gathered
                        from my oral histories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You're right. Nancy Drew was definitely a hero. I also read a lot of
                    biographies of women in history. In retrospect, I think they made a strong
                    impression. As a very small child, my sister and I were read a lot of German
                    fairy tales, like Grimm's, which were pretty violent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel - I mean, obviously you're just a
                        kid, but about the Soviet menace? Was that something that was talked around
                        about or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I had a much greater sense of the ambivalence that the Germans felt
                    toward Americans. Little German boys could be pretty mean to us kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting for your picking that up, because I think
                        people went over there as adults as I did. You didn't get this from the
                        people you met. It probably, you know, learned to keep a straight face or
                        something, but little boys particularly, and probably little girls too. I
                        mean, they were picking up what they got from their parents, but they didn't
                        put that false face on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. I remember being called names and having stones thrown at us for
                    being American.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. That was a time of signs on the wall, “Yankee go
                        home” and all. So, you left Germany about 1953?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: '54.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We came back to the United States where Dad worked in Washington for
                    two years. It was one of the worst two years of my life. Don't think kids don't
                    go through culture shock, because they do. My sister and I had actually gone to
                    the same school for two years in a row in Germany and I felt in total control as
                    a second grader. When we came back to the States, with a baby brother, Susan (my
                    sister) and I attended four different schools in two years. Other kids used to
                    make fun of my namand the fact that I wore glasses made me fair game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come home every evening and cry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. But I was spent a lot of time figuring out what I needed to do to
                    be accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have three Foreign Service kids myself and coming back
                        to Washington was traumatic: They would each go into their room and slam the
                        door. My wife would run around, trying to bake cookies for them and they
                        just didn't want to talk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yep. I can understand that. Then, after three moves in two years, Dad
                    joined the Foreign Service and announced we were going to France. I was not very
                    happy about it, because I had made friends, settled down and now we were
                    leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your father get sent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Paris from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: 1956 to 1960. My parents, Dad, in particular, thought this would be a
                    great opportunity for the kids to learn French so they plunked us in a small,
                    French private school. Susan and I hardly spoke a word of French. We survived
                    because the educational system at the time put such an emphasis on recitation.
                    At the end of each lesson there was a summary, a “resume.” You were to learn the
                    resume by heart and spout it back. That we could do and we did. We had no idea
                    what we were saying at first. It took me four years to recognize that one of the
                    prayers the teachers had us recite at breakneck speed every of school was the
                    same prayer I was saying every Sunday in English at the American Church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a French School was this? Was it a public
                        school and was it in a particular area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was a private school in a small town outside of Paris, a town called
                    Vaucresson. The school was started by a widow by the name of Madame Canet, who
                    was a huge influence on me, although I didn't recognize it until later. She wore
                    the same elegant, black suit with a rhinestone or diamond pin every morning.
                    Standing erectly on the stoop of the house she had converted into a school, she
                    would glare at the children lining up according to class. Then she would yell at
                    one class or another: “first grade over there, straighten out your line!” When
                    everybody was perfectly in line and, of course, silent, she would give
                    announcements. We would all file past her as we entered to go to class. Girls
                    were supposed to curtsy, boys, remove their berets (part of the school uniform)
                    and kiss her hand. I never dithought it was beneath me as an American!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the classes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: They were small rooms with long benches and tables with ink wells for
                    dip pens. It was out of another age! My favorite book of the time was Jane Eyre,
                    because I so identified with that bleak orphanage she was raised in. I never got
                    the hang of a dip pen and made a mess with blots, so I used a fountain pen.
                    Ballpoints were not allowed. Even math calculations were done in ink</p>
                <p>Once a week in elementary schooonce a month in the upper school — Madame Canet
                    would stride into class holding report cards stacked according to the grade.
                    Every student was ranked. Madame would call your name, you would stand up and
                    she would give you feedback on how you did that week, or month. Collectively, we
                    would hold our breath as she went down the ranks from first (best in class) to
                    last. Tears would start to well if she got to twenty without calling my name.
                    Actually, for the first year, it was pretty inevitable. Susan and I would come
                    home ranked last or next to last and Mom would say “think of what a favor you're
                    doing classmates by coming in last — you have an excuse, they don't.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful. It sounds like your mother had the right
                        attitude.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: She did. Once the language clicked in, Susan and I were moved up a
                    grade, though they kept us in the same class for some reason. By that time we
                    were competing fairly well and Madame Canet comment to the other girls: “Look at
                    these girls. When they came here they didn't speak a word of French. NOT A WORD
                    of French. NOW LOOK AT THEM. You, you lazy girls, you!” Oh, it was awful.
                    Humiliation and corporal punishment were standard practice. Teachers never
                    touched us Americans, but the French girls would be slapped around; their ears,
                    hair, yanked. Terrible. One year I got the prize for First in Conduct and
                    Politeness. That's because I was too intimidated to say anything but “oui,
                    Madame, or non, Madame.” Sure did learn discipline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about it? Obviously you were probably
                        getting very good French and French pronunciation, but do you feel you were
                        learning much? I mean more about the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh yes. It was not a particularly happy period because it was such a
                    struggle, but we did all right. We went to school Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,
                    Friday and Saturday morning. Had Thursday off. I'd focus on getting through
                    Wednesday, use Thursday to study with only a day and a half remaining. I learned
                    stress and discipline and, of course, to do my homework, always. There were
                    times in the future these lessons served me well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get along with the French girls and boys
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Most of the kids in school were girls and they were very distant.
                    Things like slumber parties or hanging out were not part of the French culture.
                    So, Susan and a British girl, Virginia, who was in our class, and I would pal
                    around together. Going to the American church in downtown Paris on Sundays was
                    the highlight of the week. After another brother was born, Mom had Susan and me
                    take the train into Paris. We were pretty faithful church-goers because it was
                    the extent of our social life with Americans kids.</p>
                <p>So, on one hand, school was very hard and the other girls, pretty cold. On the
                    other hand, at the age of 9, 10, 11 and 12, my sister and I had an enormous
                    amount of freedom in a wonderful city. Over Christmas, the family would go
                    skiing. Summers we would travel. When I was about 12, my parents sent my sister
                    and me and two other kids with a young chaperone on a bicycle tour through
                    Holland, staying in youth hostels. We received such an education about life
                    during this period.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Every Saturday morning at school we would have Religious and Moral Instruction.
                    And, every Saturday, the teacher would ask, “Who in this room is not Catholic?”
                    And, every Saturday my sister, Virginia and I would raise our hands, and every
                    Saturday she would make a disparaging remark about non-Catholics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: This woman also taught other classes, so we saw a lot of her. She
                    didn't particularly like Americans, and when the schools in Little Rock,
                    Arkansas were integrated, I remember being yelled at for being racist. I
                    remember thinking, “right and you treat Algerians so well.” But I never dared to
                    say anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was around, I want to say '62 or - wait a minute no, it
                        had to be earlier. It was '58 or so when- everything was falling apart and
                        De Gaulle came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. I remember that quite vividly. Dad had to leave the house
                    unexpectedly one night and spend a lot of time down at the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: He was an Administrative Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a chance to; again I come back to reading,
                        because I think it's always an important thing. As you got somewhat older
                        what sort of things were you reading, do you recall? French books or were
                        you reading —?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not for pleasure. What was I reading? I read avidly. A lot of the
                    classics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jane Eyre?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Jane Eyre was one of my favorites. Black Beauty, mystery books and a
                    number of British books my friend, Virginia, would lend. Both of my parents
                    loved to read and passed that on to their children. When we returned to the U.S.
                    on home leave, Susan and I would head to the public library. To me, one of the
                    most wonderful things to this day about the United States is the public library.
                    I also read a lot of junk. I know I read movie magazines and true romance, true
                    confessions. I used to hide those from my mother. I remember reading Peyton
                    Place when I was, oh I don't know, 11 or so.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at home, the French politics in whole Europe, I
                        mean was a very interesting period particularly with De Gaulle and what was
                        happening in France. France had gone through, God, I guess the Third
                        republic and the Fourth Republic was falling apart. Anyway, when De Gaulle
                        came in he was bringing a little discipline to the French political process.
                        Was this a conversation at home or were you much aware of what was happening
                        politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not so much. We took French History every year at school, of course,
                    but it always ended with Napoleon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it go up the Waterloo and it cut off about 1814?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. There was never any discussion about politics in school and I
                    don't remember my parents talking about it. What I noted of social movements was
                    through the domestic staff that would come and go. I was very aware of the
                    Hungarian Revolution, for example, because a Hungarian woman used to come to
                    iron. Other refugee women from Eastern Europe would also pass through our
                    lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About the same time, you had the Suez crisis? The French
                        were working with the British and the Israelis against Egypt and the United
                        States put the kybosh on that. Did that get reflected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We were aware of the anti-Americanism, politically, not just socially,
                    but not so much of what was happening. Far more vivid, again from the eyes of a
                    child, was the impact from the war. I was really struck by the difference when
                    I'd go back to the U.S. and find hula hoops in vogue, bobby socks and stuff like
                    that. Then we'd return to Paris where people lived so differently. To get to
                    school, for example, we would have to walk by the bombed remains of what they
                    called a “pill box,” that is, a concrete gun bunker. The Nazis had taken over
                    the house we lived in, and a German colonel was killed by the underground there.
                    The effects of the war were still real and present. We moved between very
                    different universes. And even as a young pubescent, I got the sense of how
                    foreign the Americans were to the French or to other Europeans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What - I think I know the answer, but did you ever make
                        friends enough with the French girls to go to their home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did? Oh you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a surprise. I mean -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We eventually got accepted enough to be invited to some parties and
                    vice versa. In fact, we were actually pretty good friends with a French girl who
                    lived on the other side of Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning back to the political. While you were going to
                        their houses, were you getting many questions about America and all that or
                        was it just girls having a good time together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was just girls. There were sharp differences between us, of course.
                    Susan and I had so much more in the way of things... records, clothes,
                    everything. But we were pretty normal girls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the political side, I mean were there all sorts of
                        street demonstrations? I mean, I watch French news here in Fairfax County we
                        get it and it seems like - not now, during the summer you don't have
                        demonstrations, people are on vacation, but during the Spring and Fall they
                        demonstrate. Were there a lot of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh yeah. My mother would say it was having gone to French schools that
                    brought young people out in the streets in total rebellion as soon as they
                    turned 18. They were finally able to demonstrate what they were thinking or to
                    have a thought other than what was reflected by the teacher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Beatles a big thing at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not yet. There was a radio station, Radio Luxembourg, that broadcast in
                    English for three or four hours a night, and that's where I got my teeny bopper
                    music.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: American music was really important. So, these were Frankie Avalon and
                    Connie Francis days.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1960 you're off again, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whoa! Now that was quite a jump wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It certainly was. Mom got out the Encyclopedia Britannica so we could
                    see where it was! She had already warned us that, “If we're in Paris, you can be
                    sure that the next place we go to isn't going to be very nice.” I'm not sure how
                    she did it, but she kept her eye on who would be leaving hardship posts. The
                    standard line at that time was “at least we're not going to Ouagadougou!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went in 1960. I assume you went on home leave
                        before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, we went directly from Paris to Karachi. We bought a new car and Dad
                    drove Susan and me through France and Italy, meeting Mom and my younger
                    brothers, Peter and Jonathan, in Rome. We then took a ship from Naples. In those
                    days as often as possible we would go from post to post by ship.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you all were in Karachi from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: '60 to '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By any chance you - many people of, particularly young
                        people were sort of infected by the campaign of 1960, this was Nixon versus
                        Kennedy. Did that penetrate to your family at all? Were you aware of it or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, not so much then. We were aware of the Cuban missile crisis later.
                    There was a lot of discussion at school. We also had lots of discussion about
                    the Berlin Wall going up and Red China — whether or not we should recognize
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this was pretty common in the Foreign Service. I
                        mean, being pragmatic. I mean you just don't - this whole idea of non
                        recognition doesn't make much sense something the size of China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. We read and talked at length about The Ugly American, which came
                    out about '60. In Karachi, we all went to an international school, so we were
                    out of the French system and into a more American environment. Since it was an
                    international school, we had Pakistanis, as well as people from different
                    embassies. One of my classmates was the son on the Yugoslavia Ambassador. We
                    discussed communism and he would proclaim, “I'm not red, I'm pink.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you recall of Pakistan, Karachi when you were
                        there? At that point, Karachi was the capitol of Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Islamabad was hardly a gleam in anybody's eye. In fact, the Chancery,
                    which is now the Consulate was brand new. Karachi was still suffocating from the
                    refugees who fled India during partition. Here, the issue with partition was
                    very raw and still as vivid to the Pakistanis as World War II was to the
                    Europeans. It was a very, very crowded city with only one restaurant one could
                    go to, outside of the Metropole Hotel . The Karachi American School was in its
                    first year of moving away from a correspondence system. The year we arrived was
                    the first year under the new system and most of the teachers were spouses, the
                    mothers of my friends. Rather than being greeted by Madame Canet every day, we'd
                    interact with upright Foreign Service spouses who might not have any background
                    in a particular subject matter, but by Heaven, they were smart and they taught
                    us how to read; how to speak; and how to write. Our math teacher, for example,
                    was a Polish woman, who was a pilot for the Polish underground during the war. I
                    mean, how cool is that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the adjustment from the discipline of the
                        French system to the somewhat independence of the Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I loved it. School was just so much easier, not nearly the same amount
                    of work or homework. The teachers were so much nicer and we were actually
                    allowed a social life. Since there was so little to do in Karachi, the school
                    became the social center for most of us. There was the drama club and the debate
                    club, the Spanish club and the this and the that. So, we were learning in a way
                    that was very different from sitting on a bench using a dip pen and spouting
                    back the things that the teacher had just told us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any or did it come and hit you in the face at
                        sometime, by not having gone through American schools and going to a French
                        school, which was concentrated on French history, that you weren't picking
                        up American history and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not so much, because I read a lot. We took American history in high
                    school. The only places where I felt a lack — I didn't think about it at the
                    time — but in retrospect, were the sciences and math, but especially the
                    sciences were just not a part of the curriculum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Karachi a type of place that I understand Bombay was
                        and maybe still is with beggars and you know, I mean you almost have to
                        learn to ignore it or you can be overwhelmed. How did you, as a kid, this
                        must have had quite an effect on you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Men chewing beetle nut would sometimes spit at our feet because we
                    Americans were not veiled. So, walking downtown wasn't pleasant. Also, the sea
                    of humanity was something. For some reason, though, I wasn't particularly
                    scared. I didn't go out alone, however. We lived in something of a compound, a
                    small neighborhood that held the residences of the Ambassador, as well as the
                    DCM, admin, econ and political counselors and their families. There were other
                    kids our age around so, if we went downtown without our parents, we were usually
                    in a group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much contact with Pakistani kids and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The school was probably 40 percent Pakistani so, yes, we were in daily
                    contact. For a couple of years, Susan and I were active in the Karachi American
                    Society, a cultural center run by the US Information Service They would hold
                    square dances and it was only as an adult that I realized why square dancing was
                    so popular with young Pakistani methey could dance with young American women! It
                    didn't occur to me at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time were you absorbing anything about Foreign
                        Service work and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh yes, I absorbed a lot. Much of it, not good. This was a time when
                    the wives were a part of the employee's evaluation. My mother resented being
                    considered “two for the price of one” and was insulted to be a part of Dad's
                    performance evaluation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. I used to rate the wives. God, I hated that. In
                        our efficiency reports we had to rate the wives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yep. Mother didn't appreciate that. Nor did she appreciate the
                    inspectors coming out and checking out her lifestyle. She and other wives didn't
                    resent the hardships that came with having to drag their kids around the world
                    or living in difficult and isolated places, but they did resent how they were
                    treated. And, I didn't appreciate being told all the time, “everything you do
                    reflects on your father.” Because he was a senior officer at the embassy, we
                    lived away from other Americans. The caste system was very much alive and well,
                    and kids were very sensitive to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you were there? Did the
                        ambassador's wife play any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Absolutely. It had a profound effect on how the kind of ambassador I
                    wanted to be. The two ambassadors Dad served with were Rountree and the other
                    was McConaughy.</p>

                        remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Both of them had daughters my age, so I hung out at the Residence. The
                    style of each ambassador and spouse was felt pretty directly by kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting from your parents, I mean really from
                        your mother, a feeling about the ambassadors wives? I mean, some of the
                        ambassadors wives, Mrs. Douglas MacArthur is a prime example of it, but
                        there were others too, extremely demanding. Did you get any - was that a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not so much. Everything was much more formal and hierarchical, of
                    course. Wives went calling, attended teas for which they put on white gloves and
                    hats and were very conscious of protocol. These were the days of diplomacy of
                    the old school. There were no community liaison people or paid employees to help
                    with community or family issues. The wives were expected to welcome newcomers
                    and support all school and community activities. A lot of that burden fell on
                    the senior wives. But, I never heard them complain about that. Karachi, in fact,
                    was my mother's favorite posting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is kind of what we all did. It's sort of expected,
                        including the officers. They weren't, I mean they have to arrive early at
                        functions and stay late. But, again you're trying to do something which
                        could be quite interesting. Well Pru, were you getting any feeling of what I
                        want to do? In other words, were you looking at the role of women at the
                        time and getting any feel. What signals were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I was clueless, totally clueless about what women could do. The women I
                    saw were either wives and mothers or single women doing secretarial, consular or
                    personnel work who would come to our house for Christmas and Thanksgiving
                    dinners. So, these were my role models. There's no way I was going to be a wife
                    of a Foreign Service officer. I was already rebelling against that. What else
                    was I going to be? Mom had both Susan and me take typing and shorthand because
                    “you can always be a secretary.” Women were still very constrained in their
                    career choices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel for the civil rights movement in
                        the United States? It was at its height during this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very much so. Foreign Affairs kids are pretty sophisticated politically
                    and aware of how important it is to be tolerant. As outsiders to other cultures
                    we already knew first hand the effects of intolerance. With no TV, radio or
                    social activities other than what we made up for ourselves, we hung out with one
                    another, as teenagers still do and talked a loabout civil rights and lots of
                    other social issues. Most of us knew people who were participating in civil
                    rights demonstrations in the States and admired them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. Today is the 22nd of July, 2005. Pru, you went off to
                        Iran, what year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1963. How old were you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: 16, 17.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up at this point, how did you feel? I mean, how did the
                        Foreign Service experience take with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, it was the only life I had ever known, so it was fine. The move
                    from Pakistan to Iran was the most difficult move I'd ever made, however because
                    I was transferring between my junior year and senior year in high school. There
                    was no consideration at the time of the upheaval on teenagers when you uproot
                    them between the junior and senior year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that's the hard one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah. And it was very tough, even more so because my sister, Susan,
                    went off to college. With only eighteen months difference in age, we had always
                    faced things together. Suddenly, she wasn't there and I was facing a new school
                    by myself, meeting kids who, for the most part, had been together for a long
                    time, or at least for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your sister go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: She went to Wells College in upstate New York, then after two years,
                    transferred to the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, back to Tehran. What were your impressions - again
                        we're talking about a teenager, but your impression of the situation in '63
                        in Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was very different from Pakistan, much harder to understand
                    politically and socially. Even though Pakistanis would often riot against the
                    U.S. for our support for India, and stare at us in the streets, we got to know
                    people through the school and other activities. The ones we knew were open and
                    accessible. That wasn't the case in Iran. People seemed much more suspicious of
                    us (with good reason if you know the history). There was a large U.S. military
                    presence and I went to the military school because it was accredited in the U.S.
                    This was the first time I had been in a school exclusively American, with the
                    exception of when I lived in the United States. So, it was much easier to live
                    in an American enclave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the military school? I know when we were
                        in the Seoul Korea, our kids were going to military school. The embassy
                        people would complain about the caliber of studies where the military,
                        mainly from the enlisted side would complain about wasting too much time on
                        cultural things. How did you find it there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Compared to the three years I had spent in Karachi under the tutelage
                    of Foreign Service spouses, this was so easy that I don't remember much of
                    anything that I learned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is always, particularly at that age you really need
                        a challenge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. That said, when I got to college, I was amazed to find how
                    competitive I was in almost every subject except math and science. Mainly,
                    because I knew how to read, I knew how to study; I knew how to write and I knew
                    how to speak. I knew manners; I knew how to conduct myself. Living overseas,
                    going to museums, historic places, cultural events, etc. provides a fantastic
                    education in and of itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much were you absorbing would you say about the
                        Persian Empire and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I spent the year after graduating from high school in Tehran, working
                    at the embassy and then at the commissary. I took a course in Persian history at
                    the university with my father. I also got to travel around the country with my
                    sister, visiting Persepolis and Isfahan. I worked with Iranians and so learned a
                    lot more about Iran than I had ever learned as a senior in high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah yes. Did you pick up any feel for the Iranian approach
                        to things at least from the people you were in contact during these two
                        years there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: They practiced a different form of Islam. The Pakistanis for the most
                    part were Sunnis, and the Iranians, mostly Shiite. Iranians looked much more
                    western than the Pakistanis. I was frequently mistaken for Iranian. But their
                    thinking was different from ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the almost over-whelming presence
                        of Americans in Iran at that time? Was there any kind of feeling of almost
                        discomfort or something as you were observing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We were there from '63 to '65, before the huge build-up. That said, we
                    had a fairly big presence, and the tension was certainly there — one could feel
                    it. It was well known in the American community that we had an enormous CIA
                    presence. It was probably well known outside of that community, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you'd picked this up I guess everybody else did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I don't want to leave the impression that Iran was a bad experience.
                    The beauty of the language; the stark beauty of the country, as well as the
                    culture were very striking, more so than Pakistan. Living there put me in front
                    of art, literature and a way of thinking that I hadn't been exposed to
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you decide to take a year off before going off before
                        going to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I went to Wells College, which was where my sister was, and I had
                    what my mother euphemistically called an emotional breakdown. I was out of my
                    depth. One year in Iran, and I'm back in the United States, never having lived
                    there since the fourth grade. I was overwhelmed. The school called my father to
                    come get me, which he did. Before he could take me back to Iran, we had to stop
                    in Washington to see a State Department psychiatrist. Maybe he wasn't a
                    psychiatrist. At any rate, from behind his desk he literally shook his finger at
                    me and said “You do anything back in Iran, and your father's career is ruined.”
                    That was the old Foreign Service for you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a somewhat similar experience. I mean, these were,
                        people were making judgments, and really didn't have any idea of the impact
                        they were having. Nobody was telling them to cut it out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was unpardonable. But it certainly impacted my behavior as a Foreign
                    Service officer, and especially as an ambassador. My passion around issues of
                    people and leadership can be traced to the personal experiences like that which
                    were so unnecessarily.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been devastating for you though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I really felt I had done something wrong. Well, sorry! It was
                    devastating, because I didn't have enough self-worth to get angry. I really
                    thought, “oh my God, what have I done to my father's career”? But let me
                    continue, because this goes to show what a difference an ambassador can make.
                    Dad and I returned to Tehran and I felt like an utter disgrace. The following
                    Monday, Dad had me doing temporary secretarial work at the embassy. The first
                    person we ran into at the embassy was the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Holmes. Not his son, Alan Holmes, but this was the father, Julius
                    Holmes was his name. We met the ambassador in the hallway and I'm thinking, oh
                    my God, what does he know, as though I had a scarlet letter on my forehead or
                    something. Whatever he did or did not know, he welcomed me so warmly that it
                    made all the difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were working at the embassy</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. And, I actually had a great time in with what they now call the
                    “gap year,” because first I worked in the commercial section for a couple of
                    months, and then I was made head of the PX and the liquor section of the
                    commissary. Dad was Administrative Counselor and put me in charge of selling
                    liquor because too much of it was ending up on the black market and he wanted
                    some controls. So I ran that section as well as the sundries and make-up section
                    for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did people put pressure on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The Shah's family and entourage had commissary privileges — they were
                    the only ones who applied pressure. I understood exactly what the Iranians meant
                    about the Shah and the government, because they would come in and cut the queue,
                    and they would demand this and that. Oh, I felt like such a self-righteous
                    American behind the counter and would say, “Go back to the end of the line, or
                    you cannot get that.” “Do you know who I am?” “Well, I don't care who you are.
                    You're on American territory right now.”</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>It was a great year for me. I had Iranian friends, and I was going out with
                    Marine Security Guards. Knowing who I was, the Admin Counselor's daughter, the
                    guys I dated were probably the most protective people a father could possibly
                    put his daughter in company with. If we were going to be 15 minutes late, they
                    would call to explain, “Now Mr. Bushnell, this is Corporal “so and so” — just
                    want you to know that the car is a little late in getting back.” I did a lot of
                    skiing and took a course at the university on Persian History. So, it really was
                    a good year for me, and it gave me a chance to grow up a little bit and decide
                    what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sort of re-think what you wanted out of
                        college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A consular officer who told me about a college in Ohio called Western
                    College for Women that focused on international affairs. One-third of its
                    student body came from other places around the world. I figured that was right
                    up my alley. Western was one of the places where the freedom marchers who were
                    going down to Mississippi were trained. A number of parents decided to pull
                    their daughters out and, so, even though I applied very late in the year, I was
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the freedom marchers and anything outside have any
                        impact on you at all? Did you feel anything about following or what was
                        happening when you were in Tehran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, but that paled by comparison to the assassination of John Kennedy,
                    which happened my senior year of high school. I became far more aware of the
                    whole civil rights movement once I was back in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Western College. Was it - sounds like it
                        must have had religious roots or not. I mean so many schools in Ohio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, it did, Presbyterian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presbyterian. What was it like when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was a nice campus with a far more integrated student body, in terms
                    of race, language and culture, than other colleges that size. I felt very
                    comfortable. It was right across the street from Miami University of Ohio and I
                    immediately learned about the double standard applied to women. If a boy was
                    caught in your dorm you were kicked out; if you were caught in a boy's dorm you
                    were kicked out, and the boy was sent a reprimand. At the time no one questioned
                    it. Cars were not allowed and we had a 10:30 p.m. curfew on weekdays and 11
                    o'clock on the weekend.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>It was a good school, though I chose to leave after two years, because I wanted
                    something larger and more diverse. I read, years and years later, an article
                    that said that most Foreign Service kids prefer and do better at large
                    universities, because they're so much accustomed to a rather large, diverse,
                    cosmopolitan atmosphere; whereas most Foreign Service parents want to send their
                    kids to small schools, thinking that it's going to ease the transition and that
                    they'll have special attention and so forth. And, it certainly held true in my
                    case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Western from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: '65 to '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Vietnam, was that playing much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I went into culture shock for a lot of reasons and that this was one.
                    The U.S. was simply not the country I thought I knew. A number of Marines had
                    become my friends in Tehran and suddenly they became “baby killers” according to
                    some of my peers. I got letters from some of my friends who were sent to
                    Vietnam, and they would write about the horrible things people were saying about
                    them. They were trying to make some sense of this. Meanwhile, at Western, some
                    of my new friends were taking a very hard stance against the war. For a while, I
                    honestly didn't know what I thought. The going expression was that if you
                    weren't part of the solution, you were part of the problem. I didn't want to be
                    part of the problem, but I didn't relate to parts of the solutions that were
                    being talking about. So, it really threw me in to a cultural and self-identity
                    tizzy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been overseas practically your whole life. Foreign
                        cultures are complicated and there are awful simplistic solutions coming
                        from the anti war people and all that. Were you seeing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I wasn't judging it. I was trying to figure out what is going on and
                    where I fit in. So, I was far more in an observer status than I was in active
                    status.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good Foreign Service training. What about courses? What
                        sort of things did you find yourself interested in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Languages. I stuck to what was safe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the young ladies at Western pointed at? Were
                        they basically for the MRS degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Some went to graduate school. This was a beginning of real questioning
                    among young women, very different from the generation of women who came before.
                    Their path was pretty well charted: You would go to college, you'd get married
                    and you were in college in part to find a husband.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were just a few years removed from Gloria Steinem and
                        Ms. Magazine and that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The beginning of that, right. Gloria Steinem and the National
                    Organization for Women came a little later. What we talked about were books by
                    people like Betty Friedan and Simone de Beauvoir. We didn't want to be like our
                    mothers. Of course, we were children of the '60s — peace and love and rebellion;
                    don't trust anybody over 30 and all that silliness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Ah, interesting times. Now known as the '60s. I'm
                        not sure people involved in it were as enamored by what they were going to
                        do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I found it confusing and divisive. You were supposed to be pushing back
                    on old attitudes, and a lot of the pushing back was really good. A lot of people
                    could identify with pushing back on racism. They could identify with pushing
                    back on violence and war as a solution. But as women, we were not supposed to
                    push back on the way we were treated, which was abominably. The anti-war
                    movement was very much a male movement. The only difference between the way
                    these hormonally charged guys treated women was the self-righteousness with
                    which they did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were the designated hand maidens of the -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That's right. Then we said, now wait a minute, if Native Americans have
                    rights and if black people have rights, and treating Vietnamese people as we do
                    is wrong, why am I condemned to wash your socks?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But after two years, you were beginning to outgrow
                        Western?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I transferred to the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1967 and
                    loved it. Loved being in Washington, which was a wonderful city for young people
                    at that time, especially if you were demonstrating against the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. You are on ground zero.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, we were still in the '60s, and the '60s for me was pretty
                    confusing and pretty awful. 1968, with the assassination of Martin Luther King,
                    Jr. and Robert Kennedy, was terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What moved you toward the University of Maryland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: My parents told my sister and me that they would pay for two years of
                    college. We were on our own after that, because they had two boys coming behind.
                    I had had two years at a private college, where I was a work-study student. So,
                    to reduce tuition — by this time my parents living in Maryland — I went to a
                    state school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you room at Maryland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I had an apartment with somebody with whom I went to high school in
                    Karachi and two other girls. We had a wonderful time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in there from '67 to '69? What were you
                        studying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: French and History, and the mix of required courses for a liberal arts
                    degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about demonstrations and the history that was being
                        made at the time? I mean there were two major ones. There was the Martin
                        Luther King, well March on Washington had already happened, but there was
                        certainly the anti Vietnam marches. Did you get involved in those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, I hated the war. I also went to the Poor People's marches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was pretty hard not to be engaged and be in
                        college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. These large marches, for the most part, were very peaceful. You
                    felt like one community in favor of a just cause, as compared to the
                    divisiveness that you got on a college campus where you didn't feel part of one
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of these was culminating and graduating? Did you have
                        any idea of what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. I got married. Turned out to have been a big mistake for both of
                    us. But, in the mean time, Tim was in law school, and I was a college graduate
                    so I went to work. My first job after graduation was working as bi-lingual
                    secretary for the Economic Counselor of the Embassy of Morocco, so I was
                    essentially a Foreign Service National. Then, I got a job as Chief Secretary of
                    the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Maryland. I was
                    still more comfortable with “foreign” people than I was with mainstream
                    Americans. I was slowly getting out into society, but still hanging on to the
                    familiar.</p>
                <p>At home, I was also working — laundry, housework, shopping, cooking. At that time
                    I thought it was perfectly normal that Tim was studying and that my salary and
                    labor were paying for everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a guy, so what's the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly, Tim was happy. At least until I got another job in late '71
                    that got me traveling around the country. That was when I really came to know
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of job was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was working with the Legal Services programs. As a part of the War
                    on Poverty, Congress established funded civil legal services for low income
                    clients. A training program was established through Catholic University to help
                    lawyers learn and enhance their trade on a range of issues from basic skills to
                    specialized representation and litigation. I started out doing logistics, travel
                    and admin work associated with bringing participants in to regional cities. I
                    spent most of my time on the road, an incredible way to see the U.S. Because we
                    involved the clients of local legal services programs in the training, I also
                    spent a time with thefor the most part they were women of all races who had to
                    struggle to survive and taught me some incredible life lessons.</p>
                <p>After a couple of years of doing this, I moved into another position that allowed
                    me to study management and eventually begin to design and deliver management
                    training to program directors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I worked there from '71 until 1976. During this time, my husband and I
                    parted ways, and I met Dick Buckley, with whom I have been happily married since
                    1979. Living in the Washington area continued to be exhilarating as we lived the
                    Watergate scandal on a daily basis. That, too, was an education in what it means
                    to be an American.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you monitoring Foreign Affairs or the Foreign Service
                        during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. I had put all that behind me. As you know, most Americans are not
                    at all interested in people who have lived abroad — their attention span is
                    about 15 minutes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At most.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Part of feeling comfortable as a 100% American was learning reference
                    points other could identify with. There was nothing about my years overseas most
                    people could relate to so I stopped talking about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, '76 you're remarried now by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, not yet. In '76 I left legal services, having decided that I needed
                    to put down roots somewhere in the U.S. I was in my early 30s and it was time. I
                    tried Minneapolis in January 1977 and lasted about 30 days in the sub-zero
                    weather. Then I decided to go to Albany, New York. Because my parents were from
                    upstate New York, we had spent home leave summers in the general area so I had a
                    degree of comfort. I was there two years working and getting my Masters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the University of New York in Albany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I went to Russell Sage College, which had evening and weekend
                    programs for people who worked. I couldn't afford to go to school full time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're not married at this point? You're on your
                        own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. This was a difficult period. The economy had tanked and employment
                    in Albany was hard to find. The money I had saved from legal services began to
                    run out and I was shocked to find that I was eligible for a program created for
                    a hard-core unemployed — CETA Program (Comprehensive Employment and Training
                    Act). I found a job at a training program run out of the State University of New
                    York, Albany, called the Public Executive Program and did some training on my
                    own to support myself as I went to night school. I received my Masters in Public
                    Administration in 1978 moved to Dallas, Texas where I married Dick Buckley.</p>

                    everybody's amazement, I joined the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>

                        your husband. I also haven't asked where the women's movement was really
                        getting going by the late '70s when you were doing this. We discussed it
                        before, but by this time it was well embedded in this system. We'll talk

                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, I was single. In'79, I move to Dallas and married Dick who had
                    taken the job as Director of Dallas Legal Services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We got married in 1979 at Dallas County Courthouse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your husband, did he have any interest or feel or
                        experience in the Foreign Affairs at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Other than having gone around the world on a ship when he got out of
                    college, no. He was a civil rights and criminal lawyer in the 1960s, started the
                    New Orleans Legal Assistance Program, served as director of Alaska legal
                    services, then came to the training program where I was working. Ultimately he
                    ended up directing the Dallas program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Texas? Texas is sort of a world unto
                        itself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I found Dallas in the 70s to be culturally alien to me, especially
                    since by now I had been working in professional jobs. I had a very hard time
                    finding professional employment and finally decided to go it alone as an
                    independent contractor. I did some supervisory training and the like. The most
                    interestinand certainly my greatest challenge — was a contract to help the
                    senior engineers at NASA in Houston understand the male mid-life crisis and cope
                    with the sense of burn-out they were feeling. Both were trendy issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>So, there I was at the age of 33, spending my waking hours becoming an expert on
                    the development cycles of American men. I can't believe my chutzpa standing in
                    front of a bunch of 50-something-year-old men. But I was prepared. When the
                    inevitable questio“what makes you think as a woman you can stand up and talk
                    about who we are?” — I was ready with the retort, “How many gynecologists or
                    obstetricians are women?” At that time, of course, there were very few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the manifestations for mid life crisis
                        for men at that time would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The theory is that we continue developing as adults, as we did as
                    children, although in more subtle ways. Periods of stability are followed by
                    transitions as we age and face different challenges. Daniel Levinson, a
                    research, proposed that stages of transition and stability were age related. For
                    example, during one's'20s, he said, it is normal to find men experimenting with
                    adult roles both socially and professionally. By mid 30s, however, most men have
                    “settled down,” as husband and father, following one particular career path. At
                    mid-life, things often change again.</p>
                <p>To connect with participants in the program at NASA, I used Buzz Aldrin's
                    autobiography. They knew him, of course, as one of the astronauts in the Apollo
                    project. Thank goodness his descriptions of the various facets of his life fit
                    the Levinson's hypothesis exactly. It was a reference point I really needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the NASA silverbacks respond to your
                        lectures or you talking to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Once they got used to me, most were just fine. They recognized I knew
                    what I was talking about and, once they relaxed, enjoyed the experience. I had
                    one encounter, though, that left a significant mark. I met up with the nasty
                    misogynist who made it his business to try to humiliate me as much as possible.
                    It was my first taste of such behavior. It was a difficult and valuable
                    experience to keep my cool and I survived it. That was the lesson. I could stand
                    up to sarcasm, rolling eyes, sexist remarks, maintain my dignity and survive to
                    talk about it the next day. A good lesson in dealing with some of the jerks I
                    later came across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought you back to the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A coincidence of events. In 1979, Americans were taken hostage at our
                    embassy in Tehran. All of a sudden a place and life I had put behind were in the
                    headlines. Then I saw David Passage as Deputy Spokesman for the Department on
                    T.V. David had graduated from the Karachi American School. A day or so later, I
                    heard an ad on the radio - Secretary of State Muskie was encouraging women and
                    minorities who fit a certain profile to apply to a mid-level entry program. All
                    of this was taking place during one of the hottest and driest summers in Dallas
                    history. Dick and I decided it was time to move on and I might as well check out
                    the Foreign Service. So, I applied and became so focused on the entry process I
                    didn't really think about the possible outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had your mother and father played any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, no, not at all. Dad had retired in 1968. He and my mother had
                    created a new life for themselves in Cooperstown, NY. They were shocked when I
                    told them. After all my complaining about how the Foreign Service has ruined my
                    life as a teenager when we moved from Karachi to Tehran, here I was voluntarily
                    applying to join.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd mentioned at the last tape and all, coming up to this
                        particular time. How had the women's movement affected you by then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I found a whole lot to be sympathetic with. When I separated from my
                    first husband, even though I had been joint and sometimes sole wage earner, I
                    was denied credit. Couldn't get a credit card. The bank did, however, let him
                    cash our joint tax refund over his signature only. I was furious. They justified
                    it saying he was “the man of the house.”</p>
                <p>When I looked for work early on, an employment counselor told me, “Don't let
                    people know how smart you are, because men don't like to hire women who are
                    smart.” Years later, in Dallas, I interviewed with a guy who worked for the
                    Office of Personnel Managemena federal agency, mind you. He advised me to wear
                    skirts with longer slits in them so I could attract more attention. Don't get me
                    started.</p>
                <p>So, I was very grateful to the courageous women who decided to do something about
                    the way we were being treated. Were it not for Alison Palmer and the women's
                    class action law suit against the State Department, for example, I would never
                    have joined the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any role model or any women/woman you looked
                        up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: There weren't that many role models for professional married women. You
                    either chose family or you chose career. I had the huge advantage of a husband
                    who truly believed in me and who assisted me in appreciating my value and
                    potential. He is passionate about people and he would push me to take risks and
                    to stand up for myself. After doing so a few times, I did not need his
                    encouragement. That said, in the Foreign Service, I encountered some terrific
                    women leaders, like Roz Ridgway, Melissa Wells, Jane Coon, and others of the
                    generation before me who paved the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find your women acquaintances trying to drag you
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, on the contrary, most have been cooperative and supportive.
                    However, as a mid-level entrant I found considerable resentment from men and
                    women who felt that I hadn't paid my dues; that I wasn't quite the best or
                    brightest because of entering through a different process, etc. This had
                    happened to my father, too, when he entered State through the Wriston Program.
                    Do you remember that Program?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, very definitely. See, I came in '55 and this was going
                        on in parallel. It allowed for the lateral entry of civil servants from
                        other parts of government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. I had seen my parents treated as not-quite true Foreign Service
                    because Dad hadn't taken the entrance exam and was in the administrative cone.
                    So, this attitude was not at all new to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In my experiences as a consular officer, my first boss was
                        a woman. I often worked with women as equals, or had women over me or under
                        me. In fact, the first professional consular officers who became FSO-2's at
                        time, which was equivalent to say, Brigadier General were two women,
                        Margaret Thailand and another Margaret. Known as the two Margarets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about when you applied. You took an oral
                        exam, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Ultimately, yes. But the first thing was to submit a written
                    application that included an autobiography and a salary history to show from
                    work experience merited consideration for mid-level positions. This was in lieu
                    of taking the written exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of legal pressure they were trying to stuff the
                        ranks so that they could say we're meeting requirements.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, the Department did not do it very willingly. State was going to
                    be held in contempt of court because of the number of years of stone-walling and
                    disingenuous behavior. So, they jolly well had to start stuffing the ranks
                    pretty quickly. The oral exam I took was the same everybody took at that time.
                    It was an individual assessment, you and.........</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Three people probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was more than three, it was five people. And they were experimenting
                    with something that year by not giving you any eye contact after they asked the
                    questions. It was very disconcerting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: One of them would ask a question and immediately start writing or doing
                    something to avoid eye contact. There were no cues as to as to whether what you
                    were saying was good, bad or indifferent or even when to stop. I would stop
                    answering the question and somebody would look up and say, “That's all you have
                    to say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was an examiner for a year in 1975-76 and we were quite
                        straight forward. I think this was some psychiatrist probably got a hold.
                        You know, every once in a while, they kept experimenting with that damn
                        thing. I think they all came out, I think the people came in, came in
                        exactly the same as any other time, but there were all sorts of playing
                        around, but we didn't have any of that. But, that was earlier on. That's
                        awful. It would be hard on the examiner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was very stressful, particularly waiting outside while the group
                    discussed your answers and decided whether to pass you or not. Coincidentally,
                    the chief examiner was the husband of my brother's fifth-grade teacher in
                    Tehran. It was he who told me to come back in and announced that I had passed.
                    Somebody else asked, “What took you so long to join the Service? Why didn't you
                    join long before?” I had to remind them that it would have been either as
                    spouse, secretary, or spinster. I was then taken to be fingerprinted. It was
                    weird.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions that were asked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: One was, “do you know what an administrative officer does?”, and of
                    course I did, fortunately. Another was a public affairs question to which I had
                    no answer so I made up some blather.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took this how were your domestic arrangements
                        going to work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: With my husband?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: He was encouraging me. I wondered how he would enjoy the Service once
                    we got iI knew what I was getting into, he did not. But, he was more than happy
                    to give up law by that time. It was just time to move on. Of course, the biggest
                    issue was his five children and how he could maintain a relationship with them
                    and provide financial support. Ironically, while I was in town taking the
                    Foreign Service exam, I had interviewed for a job at the Foreign Service
                    Institute. They were looking for somebody to create the mid-level program, what
                    then became the six-month mid-level program. And, because I had both a training
                    and a Foreign Service background they wanted to see me.</p>
                <p>Leaving Dallas was a wonderful adventure both for Dick and for me. We were
                    returning to Washington as we waited to hear if I would get off the Register you
                    are put on after passing the exams and I had gotten a terrific consulting job in
                    town. We put all of our possessions, including our plants, in the back of a
                    U-haul truck and drove to Washington, camping along the way. We would go into a
                    National Park, and I'd take the ferns and the palms out and spritz them, and
                    we'd set up our tent. It was so clear that we had ended a difficult chapter in
                    our lives and this was a wonderful way to launch into the next. Everything we
                    owned was in the back of this little U-haul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working in Washington until you got, came
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. Four months after we arrived, I received two job offers. One was
                    from FSI, the other from State personnel. I took the one that offered me the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>Q” So you joined in '81. How would you describe your A-100 course? I mean the
                    composition and all?</p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A range of ages and backgrounds. Twelve of us were mid- level entrants
                    people didn't quite know what to do with us. It was clear that the mid-level
                    people were distinct from the others because we weren't all going off to
                    consular tours and we had to compete for the jobs available. In my case it was
                    for 03 Admin jobs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be the equivalent of the major level in the
                        military. How did you feel about the administrative side, because you'd
                        picked up from the culture that you know, administrative and consular
                        offices were, you know not quite first class. Economic and political
                        officers were first class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I had no problem, although my father did. His mantra was “change cones.
                    Become a political officer. You'll never get anywhere as an admin officer.” But,
                    I enjoyed management — that's what I had done in the 15 years since graduating
                    from college, first as a secretary, then doing administrative work with the
                    Legal Services Training Program and, finally, moving into management training. I
                    had no interest in political or economic work; I had no interest in becoming an
                    ambassador. I went in with the intention of working in the Foreign Service for
                    five years. I think I already mentioned that my parents were absolutely
                    astounded that I joined to begin with, and I don't think they anticipated that
                    my career would last for very long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for the service? I mean, we'd had
                        the hostage crisis by this time I think Bob Dillon had had his embassy blown
                        up. Did you have any feel for the danger of the Foreign Service or was this
                        a factor at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I didn't think about it. Having spent time in Karachi and Tehran,
                    where, especially in Karachi, political demonstrations against Americans were
                    common and sometimes violent, I certainly was aware of the danger, but it didn't
                    in any way make me think twice. It was sort of, well, that's part of the
                    package.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. So, how did things develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I bid and got the GSO job in Dakar, Senegal. I was thrilled. Having
                    grown up in Europe and the near Asia, I was looking forward to new horizons. I
                    didn't need French language training because I had tested at 3-3. . The
                    assignment was not opening up until summer and I finished A-100 in December, so
                    I was looking at a pretty long gap before I needed to take the GSO and B&amp;F
                    training, and then finally going out to post. I was not interested in sitting
                    around FSI, so I walked into the AF/EX office and said, “I've got six months
                    until my job opens in Dakar; here I am, use me.” That was one of the best career
                    moves I ever made, although I didn't do it as a career move. I received an EER
                    before I had even left Washington for my first assignment. I was working at what
                    was then AF/I, now called Regional Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AF/I that meant, regional for what part of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: All of Africa south of the Sahar48 countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>It just so happened that I walked in at the time of year when offices were
                    crashing on human rights reports. This was before computers and e-mail. I came
                    up with a flow chart of each country's human rights report and where the reports
                    were in the clearance process. One literally had to deal with pieces of paper,
                    and if there were changes, the secretaries had to retype whole pages. Word
                    processing was still pretty primitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, the Wang was just coming in about that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I don't think we had Wang yet. At any rate, I considered the
                    secretaries my constituents, because they were the people who had to deal with
                    all of the changes. I would negotiate the changes so that they were minimal. I
                    think I got the “well organized” gene from my mother. So, I got a wonderful
                    performance evaluation. Who would have thought it? And then I went back to FSI
                    for GSO training and then out to Dakar in '82 as the GSO and B&amp;F Officer.
                    Now, I thought it was a conflict of interest; a bad idea that I'd be made BFO
                    and GSO. But they had wanted me to be both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one spends money and the other checks on how you do
                        it and this is not a good idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. It is not a good idea. Plus, I think I mentioned the other day
                    that my foundation in math was never particularly good. Beforehand, I had said,
                    “You don't want to do this.” And the person said, “You either take the
                    assignment as GSO and BFO or you say no to the assignment, okay?” I clearly was
                    not about to do that! So, there I was, on my first tour with two offices; one in
                    the B&amp;F Office on the first floor and one on the second with Shipping and
                    Customs. Dakar was a big regional hub for a number of inland countries, so we
                    had considerable trans-shipments to take care of, as well as our own stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a regional hub. I mean, it was one of the few
                        livable cities in that part of the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. It was a great tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Charlie Bray, who happened to have known my father. Dad was Executive
                    Director of the American Foreign Service Association when it was first started
                    and when Charlie Bray was very active.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation of the Senegal when you got there?
                        Would you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Abdou Diouf, who had been Number 2 under Senegal's first president
                    since independence, had inherited the presidency when Senghor, known as the poet
                    president, had ceded his position. Just before we arrived, Diouf ran for the
                    presidency on his own. The United States was very taken by the smooth and the
                    peaceful transition. It was (and still is) rare in Africa to see an elder
                    statesman with the brains and the sense of service to step down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interviewing now Phillip Kaiser who was ambassador
                        there in the '60s. He talked about dealing with Senghor who was, apparently
                        a delight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, he was an extraordinary person. Senegal and the U.S. had a great
                    relationship. The government has always been very friendly to us, and we to the
                    government. Dakar was an easy city with lots of great restaurants. Goree Island,
                    from which thousands of people had been shipped to the Americas as slaves, was
                    an International History Landmark and just off the coast. For many reasons, it
                    was a wonderful first posting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your administrative officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I had two. Stan Robinson was the Admin Officer for my first year, Don
                    Hayes was Admin Officer the second year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both the B&amp;F side and the GSO thing. They are a lot of
                        responsibility and these are supposed to be people who are well - the person
                        with those jobs are supposed to know what they're doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You're right. One of the first things I did was to hire a spouse to be
                    the bookkeeper in B&amp;F, because I could do management stuff, but there was no
                    way I was going to be the actual bookkeeper, actually keeping and totaling the
                    sums up and stuff like that. Chuck Greco was the B&amp;F person back in
                    Washington. Chuck was and is a wonderful human being, and his office was very
                    supportive of me. These were the days when the Executive Offices were kingdoms
                    in and of themselves. This was a period when there was a fair amount of
                    decentralization, so the Bureaus had a good deal of say over their money. Chuck,
                    as I said, was very kind and patient with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Senegalese staff, the Foreign Service

                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Great. I was promoted out of Dakaeven before I received tenure — and I
                    think the reasons were that I was comfortable dealing with people of other
                    cultures and I had practical management experience. I respected FSNs and they
                    respected me. In addition, the Senegalese are lovely people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a French cast to the way they did things and all
                        that you knew or was it a mainly Senegalese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was Senegalese. They are very warm and charming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Senegalese bureaucracy, because the
                        GSO more than anyone else has to deal with getting clearances, getting
                        things done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Entrenched, slow and needing a lot of hand-holding. We would hire
                    expeditors to get our things out of customs. I found that through GSO work you
                    get an interesting insight. For example, I was at a Country Team meeting once,
                    filling in for the Admin Officer and, when it came my turn to say something I
                    focused on the sudden problems we were having getting our pouches cleared
                    through customs. I asked if anyone knew if the Senegalese government was upset
                    about something. Evidently, it was. It didn't occur to anyone that there could
                    be consequences in the administrative operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you while you were there, pick up any of the
                        resentment about who are you coming in as a mid career or was that a
                        Washington phenomenon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That was very much of a Washington phenomenon. What people at post
                    cared about was whether their goods had cleared customs! I met people at their
                    most stressful moments, arriving and leaving post. People were interested in how
                    effective you were at your job, not how you had entered the Service.</p>
                <p>More of an issue was the fact that my husband came as a so-called “dependent”
                    (now termed “family member”). Remember, until the mid 70's women officers who
                    married were expected to resign. This embassy had experience with only one other
                    male spouse, and that was not a good experience. Within the first month of our
                    arrival at post, Dick was offered a job. He had both accounting and legal skills
                    to offer. About a week later, a group of women spouses came to the house very
                    put-out that Dick had gotten the job so quickly when they had been unable to get
                    one at all. They felt, probably correctly, that the administration of the
                    mission had thought that a male spouse had better find decent work soon. I felt
                    very ambivalent. On the one hand, I understood exactly what they were saying;
                    and on the other hand, I thought, why are you mad at me? It's not my fault. Do
                    you want me to tell Dick to quit the job? I certainly didn't want him to.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. It was my first post. I was checking things out — how things work,
                    where I fit, and that Dick be accepted. He was. The second year, Dick applied
                    for and got the job as Community Liaison OfficeI think he was one of the first
                    men to have that position in the worlwithout any fuss.</p>
                <p>I was given a wonderful challenge to prove myself by Ambassador Bray. Dakar was
                    one of the posts chosen for as a “designated language post.” This was an effort
                    to see if it was possible to make every direct hire, including Marine guards,
                    language speakers at least to the FSI 2 grade level. I was fluent in French and
                    Bray clearly thought I could handle taking this over along with my other
                    responsibilities. So, I became post language officer. The program was ultimately
                    deemed unfeasiblin Dakar the ambassador's secretary had to leave because she
                    could not (would not) achieve the minimum 2/2. I won't even talk about the
                    Marines.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, we had the staff over a couple of times, but I didn't do much

                <p>BUSHNELL: Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister and angry at the U.S. Relations
                    were not good. She threw out American businesses, for example. There were
                    significant strains between the Indian government and the United States
                    government, which made us all the more grateful that we were in Bombay and not
                    New Delhi. Bombay was a very cosmopolitan city, home of “Bollywood,” and movie
                    stars, as well as ParseeZoroastrians who had fled Persia many years before and
                    who had a significant impact on the culture in Bombay. I found New Delhi to be

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The city was overwhelming. Twenty mission people (at that time) on a
                    narrow peninsula. There was scarcely any room so there were very few houses
                    left. Instead, you had high-rise buildings and lots and lots and lots of people
                    in the streets, sleeping, raising families and doing everything. It was also a
                    practice in Bombay to honk your horn when the traffic light turned from red to
                    green. So, you had a cacophony of noise, odors, heat and overwhelming
                    population. Dick and I had a conversation about six weeks after arrival about
                    how we were going to survive this experience, and we decided that the way was to
                    get out of Bombay as frequently as possible. We traveled a lot around western
                    India, which was terrific.</p>
                <p>Professionally, I found it challenging, because I was the first woman to hold the
                    position of Admin Officer. A lot of Indians felt very uncomfortable dealing with
                    a woman and made no bones about it. The first time I met the Chief of Police he
                    stared and said, “I can't believe the United States of America would send a
                    woman to do this job”! The status of women was abominable. In addition, there
                    were tensions among the FSNs that I had not seen in Senegal. I found it
                    difficult to form teams among the people with whom I worked at the Consulate.
                    It's not that I didn't enjoy most of the people as individuals, I just couldn't
                    get the supervisors to see themselves as part of a larger team. So I stopped
                    even having staff meetings. I've always regretted that. I think I should have
                    put more effort into it.</p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, there was an awful lot going on at the time, as well. Bombay was
                    the point in my career when I began facing disasters. Twice when I was “acting”
                    in the absence of the Consul General, we had crises. First, when Mrs. Gandhi was
                    assassinated and then when the Union Carbide plant in Bophol, which was in our
                    consular district, experienced a chemical leak that killed I don't know how many
                    people, and injured thousands and thousands more. The British Consul General was
                    assassinated during our tour, and we had the fall-out from President Reagan's
                    decision to bomb Libya. Lots of demonstrations in front of the consulate. I was
                    the post security officer, so Harry Cahill, our CG would always send me out to
                    face them. “You're such a nice lady, they won't know what to do, and they
                    certainly won't harm you,” he would say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The assassination of Indira Gandhi, what happens when the
                        head of state, well the prime minister of the state is assassinated? Do we
                        automatically bring the flag down -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Ah, interesting that you ask that, because that was “the” issue of the
                    day, whether to bring the flag down. I was so happy when dusk finally came, and
                    I could pull that flag off the flagpole. Rumors were rampant about whether or
                    not the Prime Minister had actually been killed, and the Indian government was
                    stonewalling, so we didn't know what to do with the flag during most of the day.
                    Fortunately, the Public Affairs Officer, Alan Gilbert, had prior experience when
                    President Sadat was assassinated in Egypt. Alan called me and recounted that
                    when our embassy in Cairo lowered the flag before the Foreign Ministry, it got
                    into a heap of trouble. His advice to me was, “Don't lower the flag no matter
                    what until the Indian government lowers its flag.” And, that was absolutely the
                    correct instruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. It's the sort of thing you wouldn't think about
                        really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Or you think, who cares and who's watching? But, lots of people were
                    watching. We had crowds in front of the consulate demonstrating, because we had
                    not lowered the flag. Later, the Chief of Protocol telephoned to complain that
                    we had. I was just grateful that we'd abided by the rules of protocol.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction in Bombay? This was Sikhs who killed
                        Mrs. Gandhi. This is obviously not a Sikh area, but what was the reaction
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: There was the natural horror that people experience when your head of
                    state is assassinated. There wasn't any kind of hate; people were sad and left
                    it at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the area was what? Was it Parsee? What
                        was the prominent religion?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Hinduism, then Islam. Parsees originally came from Iran and were
                    Zoroastrians, which I think, was the first monotheistic religion in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there religious-based riots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not as many as you hear about now. The fundamentalist Hindu Party had
                    almost no political power. That said, I always had the feeling in Bombay that a
                    spark could ignite at any time because of the density of the population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that you as the Administrative Officer and
                        responsible for people and security officer, that Americans driving there
                        must have given you great concern.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Few of us had cars and a shuttle took people to and from work. The
                    consulate motor pool was large enough to accommodate those who wanted to rent a
                    vehicle and hire a driver. Taxis were also plentifuand dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just steam right through the crowd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yep. Or that you wouldn't run into a wall. We actually did not lose
                    anybody from a traffic accident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your local staff, you're saying you almost had to
                        deal with them individually. This must have been very difficult, wasn't it?
                        Could you communicate to, because there's times when you just want to tell
                        everybody, we're going to be doing this, or we've got this problem coming up
                        or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, I would have meetings, but people would sit in silence. After,
                    people would phone me but they wouldn't say much of anything in front of anyone.
                    It was rather frustrating. But, we got a lot accomplished, including finding
                    properties, which was an excruciating task. Housing was going at something like
                    $3,000 a square foothis was 1982, mind you. A lot of landlords wanted offshore
                    payment so they wouldn't have to pay taxes, which we, of course, were prohibited
                    from doing. This diminished my negotiating leverage considerably. But it was OK
                    to offer cash, so I did. One landlord picked up $96,000 in hundred rupee notes
                    that we had put in two or three liquor boxes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the local staff. What about women? At most
                        posts women are the backbone of our foreign national staff, because we
                        usually offer a better deal for women than most other businesses. How about
                        in Bombay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Let's see. My secretary was a woman, as well as the personnel, protocol
                    and travel people. Also, the head consular FSN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bhopal. This sent shock waves around the world. In a way,
                        I got the feeling that the Indians really enjoyed this. I mean, it's the
                        wrong term, but I mean this is a chance to really stick it to the United
                        States and to capitalism and all that. When it happened, did the embassy
                        realize that they had a horrible situation on their hands? Were they sending
                        any help down or instructions or how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The embassy took over, although when the Union Carbide CEO, Warren
                    Anderson, came rushing in, he stopped at the Consulate. I remember strongly
                    advising him not to go to Bhopal but he did. He was arrested within minutes and,
                    once he was plunked in jail, it became a bilateral issue that was dealt with in
                    Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said a British Consul General was killed. Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You know, I don't know that we ever found out. I think it was thought
                    originally that it was an act of terrorism, but then, ultimately, there were
                    rumors that this was private.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although you were the Administrative Officer, you getting
                        reflections from, I would imagine the consular section would. Isn't, this is
                        the area of India where all the motel people came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, from Gujarat. We had huge, long visa lines. I remember I wanted to
                    put in new bathrooms, because we had inadequate facilities. I thought I was
                    being really clever when I sent a cable to Delhi talking about the number of
                    toilets we had, the average number of visa applicants we had per day, the
                    average time they were in the waiting room and, therefore, the average number of
                    flushes the toilets had. And therefore, after oh six zillion flushes, we needed
                    new toilets, and they sent back another cable saying, “Nice cable, nice try, no
                    money.” We had money for security after our embassy in Beirut was blown up in
                    1983, but not for toilets in Bombay!</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>As a result of the Inman Commission which looked into the vulnerabilities of
                    overseas embassies, Congress gave funding for security upgrades. I spent my last
                    year taking apart and rebuilding the consulate, especially the consular section.
                    The consulate was a former Maharaja palace and looked like one, so we had to
                    work carefully. And I had a really good time. We needed to put in watch towers,
                    so I went out to a local architect to see if he could design something in
                    keeping with the architecture. It looked like it was part of the original
                    design. Yeah, it was a great deal of fun. I enjoyed being Admin Officer,
                    actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're doing things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right and fairly autonomously. You know, if you're taking care of
                    people's needs, and providing good services, by and large people leave you alone
                    to do your job, and I really enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you were a security officer and dealing with
                        the police and all. Are you saying you had problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Some. But, ultimately, I had good relations. The police official I
                    dealt with most was the head of the traffic police. And I thought, oh what a job
                    you have! I got along with him very well. The Bombay International School was
                    right across the street, and the children would use the consulate grounds as
                    their play ground. They literally had to dodge cars careening around the corner.
                    I wanted to get a traffic policeman to stop the traffic as the children walked
                    across the street, which I ultimately did.</p>
                <p>We also had lots of bomb threats, so I got to know the people with the sniffer
                    dogs pretty well. I found that after a couple of encounters I would get along
                    well with whomever I needed to. But it took a huge amount of energy. When we got
                    on a plane to leave Bombay, I felt a huge weight lift off of me. Part came from
                    relief from the responsibilities but also from expending so much effort to get
                    the kind of attention I needed from Indian officialgetting them to deal with me,
                    whatever they thought, and with respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the bomb threats about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Our policies. U.S.-Indian relations were not very good. Plus, the
                    sub-continent has never been the safest area of the world. Airplane hijackings
                    were fairly frequent, and I think it was then that the Air India flight was
                    hijacked. It was a high-threat environment, and the bomb threats just became a
                    part of it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, not really. We did enjoy lots of other aspects of Indian art. So
                    much of it is public art. The huge posters advertising movies were all done by
                    hand and some were just incredible. The architecture in Bombay was also amazing.
                    When I first went there, all I saw were buildings with green mold oozing down
                    because of the effects of humidity on the limestone. But, once you began to look
                    beyond, there was amazing architecture.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a big arch there isn't there?</hi>

                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, called the Gateway to India.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: He did some consulting work with the embassy, and he served as a
                    consular associate at the consulate. In those days, associates could work the
                    visa lines, so that's what he did. For one year he was the principal of the
                    Bombay International School. He was good. He did the job that needed to be done,
                    and I think people were very grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his impression of the visa lines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Overwhelming. After we returned to the United States and we were in
                    some store, I heard my husband's name being called, and it was an Indian woman
                    who came up and said, “I want to thank you for the visa you gave me. I got
                    another one.” [laughter]</p>

                        I mean, they had very close relationships with the Indians, certainly up in
                        New Delhi. How was that played out in Bombay?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I didn't get involved in political issues. The CG didn't talk about
                    them in staff meetings. The Soviets were not players in my world. My only
                    encounter was a Russian who came at the signing the condolence book for the
                    assassinated Prime Minister. The CG had broken his arm and wanted me with him to
                    sign the book. My instructions were to sign the book ahead of the Soviets. It
                    was critically important. It seemed pretty silly, but okay. The only Indian
                    woman presenthe only other woman in that mass of people — either deliberately or
                    inadvertently helped me cut short the rigid protocol, which gave me a great spot
                    in the long line waiting to sign the condolence book. The Soviet CG then arrived
                    with a huge wreath and jumped the queue. I was not going to cede my place, so we
                    literally stepped up to the table together, facing the television cameras. He
                    had two choices: elbow me out of the way or behave like a gentleman, which is
                    what he did. So, I got there first. Another triumph for our side!</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I suppose. I found it a little amusing. Had I been a man, it would

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We had a nice community and would get together often. The consulate
                    rented a beach hut you can't do this anymore —a few miles out of town.
                    Representational events also came frequently because Bombay was India's
                    commercial capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether you found that since Bombay was a
                        big commercial center and there's some people with lots of money in
                        India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, incredible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I got addicted to Indian food. Bombay had wonderful restaurants. I
                    learned what a difference freshly ground spices make. Also, Dick and I traveled
                    at every opportunity.</p>

                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Pretty light. Harry Barnes was ambassador the first year, and I can't
                    remember the name of the ambassador the second year. He was a political person,
                    a non-career person. Harry Barnes had a very light touch. His replacement did
                    not. He would no longer allow Bombay to send cables out — everything had to go
                    through Delhi for clearance before going out, so you had a different
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the administrative side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very light. I was almost autonomous. The most interaction I had was
                    with the budget people and the regional security officer was when we were doing
                    the physical upgrades. The embassy and consulate admin sections orbited their
                    own universes — didn't even have annual conferences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your tour was up in '86. You're off, wither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Foreign Service Institute. Ambassador Jane Coon, who was the Dean of
                    the School of Professional Studies, actually called Bombay to recruit me. I was
                    thrilled at the personal attention. Evidently, the mid-level management training
                    program, mandated by the Foreign Service Act of 1980, had been declared a
                    failure. This was the program for which I had been offered the job in '82.
                    Whoever designed the program decided to give people all of the training they
                    would every need. Ever. So, FSOs were taken out of the system for 5 or 6 months.
                    Wrong approach! There was total rebellion.</p>
                <p>So, we came back to the States and bought a house in Reston, VA — FSI was in
                    Rosslyn at the time. I was given the title of Director of Executive Development,
                    a staff of 3 people, a budget of about $100,000 and the instructions to “create
                    a program for the O-1 level that will be equally applicable to all cones. It
                    cannot be more than two weeks. Good luck.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd taken something. I think it was a week we went
                        out to a place on the Chesapeake for a week and had a, this was back in the
                        '70s I think. You know, I mean people who were about the O-1 level. It
                        wasn't bad as a matter of fact. But, it was I think called mid career or
                        something like that. But, you had nothing particularly to work on at that
                        point. I mean, the other, the five months thing had been discarded by that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. It was one of the most wonderful experiences in my career. In
                    addition to creating the new course, we had a number of other courses to
                    oversee, including the DCM course. The same contractors had been running the DCM
                    course for eons; some of the case studies still had people going to Vietnam, for
                    heaven's sake! I decided that we needed to redo the DCM course, as well as
                    design the new one. Some of my colleagues said, “No way can you do it. It can't
                    be done Pru. You're not going to be able to do it. There's no way you can put
                    consular, admin, econ and political officers together and give them the same
                    training.” This was a time when a lot of folks considered that “training is for
                    dogs” and would have no problem saying that to our faces. Ambassadors and DCMs
                    who would proudly declare, “Morale isn't my issue. If people don't like the post
                    they can leave.” Management was what admin officers did, not what DCMs or
                    anybody else did. It was a word that was laden with negative connotations. So, I
                    changed the focus of the new course from management to “leadership.” We called
                    it the Foreign Affairs Leadership Seminar.</p>
                <p>Judy Kaufmann was working with me and we called in consultants to help us design.
                    We started by soliciting names of senior career people considered to be good
                    leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Corridor reputation basically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. We then went out and interviewed them face to face. We would
                    send them the question ahead of time: “Think of a time when you were exercising
                    leadership effectively. If there had been a video camera there, what would that
                    camera have seen you do?” We got access to very senior-level people, including
                    Roz Ridgeway, who was Assistant Secretary of EUR at the time, because shoot, who
                    doesn't like reflecting on a really good job done as others take notes. We
                    interviewed in pairs - one would take notes while the other asked questions.
                    Then, we'd race back to write the notes up, scrubbing them for any classified
                    information. We then handed them over to outside consultants, because we wanted
                    fresh eyes to look at this. The consultants extracted themes from over 20
                    interviews. These were then given to an advisory group of senior people to
                    consider. We knew we needed to get senior people interested in training or else
                    they would never let their staffs out of their offices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the hardest thing in the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It is a hard thing. The themes that emerged were astounding to me
                    because they included skills like team leadership, active listening and
                    advocacy. Things we seldom saw in practicat least I didn'much less heard about
                    as valuable. Once we had the priority themes, or skills, we started the design
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the contractors come from? Did you find them
                        coming up with good ideas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. I had been a contractor, a training contractor before I joined the
                    Foreign Service, so I knew their world. I knew what role they could play that
                    would be helpful to me, and I knew what my role was, which was to take that
                    which made sense and discard that which wouldn't work in our culture. Judy
                    Kaufman was particularly good at this — she was very vigilant about what would
                    work, what kind of vocabulary to use, etc. That was very important. We also
                    decided to break the molto make this training completely different from the kind
                    of training people were used to and complained about. I mean, you don't train
                    people on how to build teams by just talking about it. The contractors came up
                    with the suggestion that we look at outward-bound kinds of exercises for the
                    team building. So, that's what I decided to try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what outward bound types of
                        exercises?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Outward-bound exercises are physical challenges, like going down zip
                    wires. As a group you take on physical challenges that look very difficult but
                    can be accomplished if you use team effort. It is a wonderful technique for
                    teaching people some fundamental lessons about achieving success as a group. You
                    can structure the challenges in a variety of ways and turn them into metaphors
                    that fit the real world. You ask people to set objectives, decide on the leader,
                    figure out the problem and the solution.</p>
                <p>The reason I liked the concept so well is that it would put everyone on an equal
                    footing, no matter what their experience, career track, etc. FSI had never used
                    this as a training mechanism. I was very lucky because Charlie Bray, who had
                    been my ambassador in Senegal, was the head of FSI, and Bill Swing was the
                    Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in Human Resources. We went out together to
                    try some of these challenges ourselves and they became very enthusiastic.</p>
                <p>I used strict criteria to decide the level of difficulty, beginning with whether
                    or not I could accomplish the challenge. I figured if I could do it, anybody
                    could do it. There was no way that I was going to stress people out; the Foreign
                    Service was stressful enough. The last thing I wanted was macho behavior. I was
                    very conscious of my role, both as a creator of a training design and as a
                    female, to get exercises that would be challenging, but something everybody
                    could do whether you were an athlete or not or whether you're uncomfortable with
                    heights, which I am. So, as an example, I threw out the zip wire — it was
                    terrifying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going down a wire on a?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Actually, we climbed a tree about eight feet up. It looked pretty high
                    to me, and we walked out on a plank. It was a wide plank and you were in a
                    harness, but still it was a plank eight feet off the ground with nothing to hold
                    onto. At the edge of the canyon, someone straps the harness to a thick, steel
                    wire and you go zooming over the canyon to the other side. I was terrified. I
                    did it because I was too scared to walk the plank back to the tree, but I swore
                    that I put anyone else through such fear.</p>
                <p>We also made use of video cameras. I'd had this training background, right, and I
                    had studied men at mid-life. I knew these people. I also knew what masks we wear
                    in the Foreign Service. So, the aim was getting behind the mask in a very
                    collaborative environment. In other words, not forcing it, but just enabling
                    people to do it. Taping someone and showing her how she looks to others can be a
                    powerful tool. We'd have people watch the tapes of themselves in private and I'd
                    hear exclamations like: “Oh my God, my wife has been telling me for 25 years
                    that I do that and I didn't believe her!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feedback from the leadership course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was wonderful. The course lasted 15 years, largely unchanged. I was
                    the one who decided to “kill” it when I returned to FSI in 2002 because we were
                    the capstone course Colin Powell wanted and we couldn't do both. There is a
                    whole community of people in the Department who still have warm feelings about
                    the course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the various cones and others, but
                        basically I assume you had USIA people in there too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. This was before we had them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they had an admin, political, economic and consular.
                        Was there a difference? I mean, did you find differences in ways of approach
                        and that sort of thing or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. The kinds of exercises we chose put everyone at the same level.
                    When you think about it, leadership is not a function of any particular career
                    track. It's a function of the individual and we focused on “leadership from the
                    inside, out.” That is, starting understanding yourself and what you have to
                    contribute before you move into the skills of working with others.</p>
                <p>We found the outdoor exercise in team-building so effective, we incorporated them
                    into the DCM course when we redesigned it. As I watched people go through the
                    exercises, I could see their leadership qualitieor lack. Now, I could think,
                    “This person's going to be real good, or that person's not going to be very
                    good.”</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you can find out that some people are leaders and
                        some aren't, but they've been slated to be in leadership positions so what
                        do you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That's been an issue that you deal with a lot in training. What if the
                    person you are helping to prepare for an important job is a total misfit? Do you
                    report on it? Our training teams and I wrestled with that issue both times I was
                    at FSI and we continued to come to the same conclusion. No, you do not report!
                    The training function is not an evaluation function. If people are going to
                    learn they've got to open themselves up, and that means they need to trust.
                    Double-cross just once and no one will open up again. There's another important
                    issue at stake, too. If I can detect that someone is a jerk within three days of
                    knowing him/her, you better believe that a lot of people in the system who have
                    seen this person perform for 20 years know that he or she is a jerk, too.
                    Putting the onus for selection and performance judgments on trainers is both
                    wrong and lousy management.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: Absolutely, oh yeah. One of the things they would say is, “You know,
                    every organization says it's different but usually it isn't. Except State
                    Department. It really is different. I don't know if you're familiar with the
                    Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I've taken that thing on the internet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Okay, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is one of the most popular
                    non-therapeutic personality tests. It measures certain qualities of personality.
                    It doesn't measure whether you're a nice person or not. It just measures how you
                    take in information, how you make decisions, things like that. Over 60 percent
                    of the Senior Foreign Service is made up of people who comprise 12 percent of
                    the American population. Some would say we specifically recruit for these kinds
                    of people. So, it's no wonder that we have a certain “type.” I think this is
                    changing. We have so much more diversity now than there was at that time and
                    diversity not just in terms of gender and race and language, but diversity in
                    terms of...........</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Outlook, exactly. It's no wonder that you could put labels on people in
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Three years. Can I give you an anecdote about the mind set of some back
                    then?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: This is an example of the times and how far we've come. As I mentioned,
                    I did the DCM training, part of which was also offsite at a place West Virginia.
                    Over dinner one night, an older fellow who was waxing eloquent about how things
                    used to be. “The Foreign Service has never been the same since.....,” he said. I
                    expected him to finish with, “since we began accepting women and minorities.”
                    But, he didn't. He said, “The Foreign Service has never been the same since we
                    began accepting people from land grant colleges.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Can you imagine anybody saying that today? Would never happen, thank
                    goodness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yeah. Diplomacy has been renowned for years for having
                        people with attitudes, and protocol and you do this and you do that in a way
                        that extends over to the background of people and wanting to know who you
                        are. The stud book and the whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, this must have been fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, it was wonderful. I loved it! And, it was a major turning point in
                    my career. When I decided to go to the FSI, a number of people said, “Why are
                    you doing this? This is not career-enhancing. You know, it's bad enough you're
                    an Admin Officer, but if you spend three years at FSI you will go nowhere.”
                    Well, as a result of the Foreign Affairs Leadership and DCM seminars, I got to
                    interact with senior people in the Department. Mary Ryan, who was Special
                    Assistant for the Undersecretary for Management called me one day to say, “I
                    think you should be a DCM and I will be happy to help you.” Wow! I'd never
                    thought of becoming a DCM, but it was because of this non-career-enhancing job
                    and doing what I loved doing and doing what I was good at, taking the challenge
                    and making a success of it that my career took a detour, and I have never been
                    in an admin job since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were working at the FSI, George Shultz
                        was the Secretary of State wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although I don't imagine he came down and chatted with you
                        and all, but did you feel that we had a Secretary of State who was
                        interested in the system? Most Secretaries of State are not interested in
                        training and management and all. Did you get any feel for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very much so. It was Shultz who insisted that money be put aside to
                    purchase the property on which the FSI now stands. There was great pressure to
                    spend money on other things, but he didn't give into it. We very much got the
                    sense that Shultz was interested in the organization, not just the policy.</p>
                <p>Q; Colin Powell being the other exception.</p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Correct. When Powell was around, people would say, “Not since George
                    Shultz have we had somebody who is so interested in the organization.” I would
                    say that's true because both Shultz and Powell had management and leadership in
                    their backgrounds. . Most people who become Secretaries of State don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Well then, what is it now 80 what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: '89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '89. You're up to be a DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of feeders did you get, because this is, the
                        ambassador essentially selects the DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Correct. I was on the list for Ghana but the ambassador wanted an econ
                    officer. I was so, so disappointed. Meanwhile, my colleague, Judy Kaufmann's
                    husband, George Moose, had been tapped for Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Judy by the way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Good, she's a really neat person. I didn't know George, though I had
                    met him. After I had been turned down for Ghana I felt the need to rehearse my
                    potential as DCM, notwithstanding my background as Admin. So, I asked George,
                    “Have you ever interviewed a DCM?” “No.” “Well, I need to be interviewing
                    ambassadors. Do you mind getting together? You can give me feedback about how I
                    present myself and I can give you feedback, given my experience in Senegal,
                    about the kind of DCM you may want. We did the session in the cafeteria. Not
                    long after, George offered the DCM position to me. So, five years after Dick and
                    I had left Dakar as CLO and Supervisory GSO respectively, we returned as DCM and
                    spouse. The FSNs were thrilled — GSO makes good! They sent a big bouquet of
                    flowers to welcome me on the first day and for the first few weeks, they would
                    give me wonderful encouragement. I would see them in the elevators and they
                    would say, “Oh, you're going to do a wonderful job. You're doing a great job.
                    Continue, you'll be fine, don't worry about it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from 1989 until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, what was the situation in Senegal when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, by now, Abdou Diouf, to whom the first president of Senegal
                    Senghor had handed off the presidency, had won elections on his own merits. The
                    ecology and economy of the country remained fragile. University students rioted
                    frequently because of proposed cuts to their subsidies. The political opposition
                    was active. In the south of the country, a separatist movement, which had
                    emerged now and then over the years, was once again causing problems to the
                    government and in the north of the country, refugees from Mauritania remained a
                    burden. There was a little bit of everything but, by comparison to other
                    countries on the continent, none of the issues was overwhelming.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did George Moose use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: He used me as the chief operating officer with significant management
                    and coordination responsibilities. Inspectors who came the first year thought I
                    was too focused on management and should be doing more reporting but I strongly
                    resisted because I thought that should be the primary responsibility of the
                    reporting officers, not mine. It was indicative of the Department's culture to
                    place a higher priority on reporting than anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, because this has been the doom of so many DCMs
                        because they did not manage and they just were enjoying themselves as
                        political or economic officers just at a slightly high </hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right, and frankly, there wasn't all that much to report in Senegal. I
                    mean, it's a pretty small country. In fact, George and the political officer
                    would sometimes get in each other's way in terms of contacts, because there just
                    wasn't that much going on. The portfolio I did take on, which I really loved,
                    was the separatist movement and the rebellion going down in the south. George
                    would send me down periodically to see what was going on and whether it was safe
                    enough for Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds a little bit like the Biafra experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah, although far less violent. There were people killed, but it did
                    not have the consequences of Biafra.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the group, the Christian group, did they have special
                        attributes within the economy or something? I mean, you know, the Biafrans,
                        I guess there Ebos were very much the office workers, entrepreneurs and all
                        that in Nigeria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I think the separatists felt marginalized and concerned that they
                    were not getting the resources due them. The Casamance area is very different
                    from the northern part of Senegadifferent ethnic groups; different environment
                    and climate; different religion. Some felt they were not getting their fair
                    share of respect or attention. The political manifesto of the separatists,
                    however, was pretty ill-defined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you had regional responsibilities. How did that
                        work with your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The regional responsibilities were primarily in the management area.
                    There was the regional personnel office. We did budget work and certainly
                    shipping and customs was a primary focus. I was very familiar with that.</p>
                <p>When you look at the neighborhood, Senegal was the dominant country. Guinea
                    Bissau was a very small country. Mali was going through a transition from a
                    military dictatorship to eventually a civilian democracy, but things were sort
                    of tenuous. Mauritania was not much to talk of and still had slavery. So, when
                    you looked around the neighborhood at who was the principal actor or partner
                    with the United States, who had the greatest interface, it was Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Qadhafi messing around there at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: In the region, yes, but not in Senegal, which was pretty conservative.
                    Lockerbie was the primary political issue associated with Libya. The first Gulf
                    War and the war in Liberia were of greater import to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the safe haven for Liberia weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We were a transit point for a number of embassies. Dakar was a peaceful
                    regional hub with good international air links.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the French there by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very strong. Dakar had been the capital of French West Africa and the
                    French retained jealous feelings about the country. They were fully entrenched
                    commercially; they had troops in the country and important political and
                    financial relationships. It was a known secret that a lot of money was going
                    back and forth. There were definitely relationships there between people in high
                    places in the French government and people in Senegal.</p>
                <p>The French were very suspicious of our interests and growing influence in the
                    region and before George Moose arrived, relations between the Americans and the
                    French embassies had deteriorated completely. George was determined that we
                    would get along better so he had me interact with the new French DCa very nice
                    man. We frankly had a wonderful time going out to one of Dakar's many lovely
                    restaurants once a month to size up one another's activities. I let him order
                    the wine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a happy embassy would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think it was a very happy embassy. That's not to say that everybody
                    in the embassy was happy. We had delightful lovely weather, because Dakar is at
                    the end of a peninsula. Senegalese are very nice people. There were plenty of
                    restaurants, two Club Meds in the country, a fair number of things to do and a
                    good sized community. Once a year, over George Washington's birthday, we would
                    be the hosts of the West African Invitational SoftbalWAIST Tournament. Teams
                    from missions in the region would gather to play three days of constant
                    softball. It was fun.</p>
                <p>Also, George Moose cared about the mission and people know when the ambassador
                    cares. We took the Mission Program Plan and the process of setting objectives
                    seriously but as an embassy, I think we were fairly relaxed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any high level visits there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah, we got lots of high-level visits. If you're going to Africa,
                    chances are you will come through Dakar to refuel. We had the VIP visit routine
                    down pat. It included the requisite trip to Goree Island from which millions of
                    people were shipped to the new world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a slave citadel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. An international historic landmark. So, yes we got lots and lots
                    of visitors. Kathy Shirley replaced George as ambassador when he and Judy
                    Kaufmann left in 1992. She continued the tradition. And, like George, she was a
                    terrific person to work for and a very popular ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm just looking at the time. It's probably a good
                        time to stop. We'll pick this up in 1989 or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '92. What happens then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The Senior Seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, we'll pick it up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Good.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 28th of July, 2005. Pru, I'd like to ask one
                        question going back to India. Can you talk a little about being an
                        Administrative Officer and the bureaucracy? I saw some of this when I served
                        in the Gulf. Can you talk a little about your experiences with Indian
                        bureaucracies as an Administrative Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A lot of Indians maintained vestiges of the Brits as they ruled in the
                    30's and 40's. Everything stopped for tea, for example. Airline reservations had
                    to be confirmed in person and noted by hand in a huge logbook. This part has
                    changed, of course, but when computers first came in, you had to show up to
                    confirm the reservation in the log book and in the computer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to capture periods. How about custom
                        clearances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I had to personally sign every single coupon that went on our pouch
                    bags. You were not allowed to use a signature stamp; you had to personally sign
                    each of the four tickets that went on each pouch. I kept a stack at the side of
                    my desk to sign a bunch at a time. Couldn't use initials, had to be your full
                    name and mine is long. Thank goodness I didn't have a middle name..</p>
                <p>Literally millions of commuters would come to Bombay every day. Their lunches
                    would be sent to them from their homes through an extraordinary system of pickup
                    and delivery. Imagine millions of lunch boxes that have to be personally
                    delivered to the office and then returned to the home before the end of the day.
                    The “tiffen” boxes, as they were called, would be picked up at the homes by
                    bicyclists, organized at the local train station to go to specific spots where
                    they would be redistributed and delivered by bicycle. After lunch, the reverse.
                    It was extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Another example of incredible efficiency is the fact that traffic actually flowed
                    in a city that size crammed into that small an area. There were huge numbers of
                    people in rickshaws, bullock carts, donkey carts, trucks, bicycles, buses and
                    feet, yet traffic moved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, go back. You went to the Senior Seminar. This is
                        from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I was in Senior Seminar from 1992 to '93.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about the composition of your
                        class? What class was this by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: 35th, 36th, something like that. Half of us came from Statabout 15 of
                    us. The other half came from other agencies, including all branches of the
                    military, AID, USIS, FBI, CIA and Customs. Twenty five men and five women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The program became quite controversial and you beheaded it
                        during your tenure at the Leadership and Management School. What did it do?
                        What was the program and how did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was a great program. It was started in the '50s as a way to get
                    people who had done good work overseas for a number of years to become
                    reacquainted with the United States. Every class designed its own prograwhom we
                    would invite to speak, what trips we would take and what we would do. A lot, of
                    course, had become routine over the years. The first trip was to Alaska, for
                    example, and the military bases we visited were pretty well spelled out. But,
                    what was there not to like? The greatest stresses I had were what to pack and
                    how to stay awake during endless military briefings.</p>
                <p>Our exposure to different kinds of people and different issues around the U.S.
                    was wonderful. We were also allowed to play with a lot of military toys which
                    was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Shooting weapons; driving a humvee; riding in Bradley vehicles and
                    tanks. Oh, I also jumped off a 35-foot tower.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is with your fear of heights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah. I considered the atmosphere of my class to be macho and frankly,
                    anti-women. We were constantly being told that we had taken all of the senior
                    jobs around town. Anyway, when we were told that we were going to jump off a
                    35-foot tower, I subjected all these guys to a lecture about what true courage
                    was — defying group pressure to choose not to jump. I was priming them for my
                    likely response when I got there.</p>
                <p>When I got up to the top, a wonderful sergeant who clearly had done this with
                    terrified paratroopers many times before, got me to the edge, heels on the ledge
                    and toes in thin air, hands poised on either side of the opening to push myself
                    off. Then, he said, “Ma'am, don't look down, keep your eyes on the horizon.”
                    And, whoom, down I went! Wow, what a rush! I was actually tempted to do it
                    again. As we did more of these kind of things I discovered testosterone I never
                    knew I had. No wonder guys love it.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>We would have interesting conversations among ourselves, and some very heated.
                    One started because a military colleague accused me of batting my eyelashes to
                    get ahead. Boy that pushed my button. I told him to knock it off because he'd
                    been getting ahead by virtue of being a white male. These exchanges were done
                    partly in fun and partly in earnest. When I left the Seminar early to take my
                    next job, though, it was the military people who roasted me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you later do away with the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: With ease of travel, e-mail, internet, etc., it had outlived its
                    function. People didn't need to go around the country to learn what it was all
                    about. It was very expensive, and, frankly, too long. It was a nine-month
                    program. By the end of it, you took for granted the quality of speakers and
                    everything else. We turned into real bratso did other classes. Secretary Powell
                    hated it. Really wanted it gone. So, when we were designing the capstone
                    leadership seminar that was to be mandatory for everyone promoted into senior
                    ranks, Kathy Peterson, who was Director of FSI at the time, and I decided to let
                    it go. I had mixed feeling about it but, ultimately, it was the right thing to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after the Seminar, then, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Wow! This was when I first got a taste of destiny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Destiny. I've never before believed in it. You see, my name was
                    forwarded to the Deputies' Committee by the AF Bureau as one of their nominees
                    for ambassador to Conakry. I was so excited. This is the committee that decides
                    on the names State Department is going to send to White House personnel as its
                    candidate. For some unknown reason, the Committee decided instead to put my name
                    up for Rwanda. I began filling out forms the likes of which I've never seen
                    before for the White House, for the Senate, and, of course, umpteen ones for
                    State, including medical stuff. I hadn't gotten any word from MED, so I called
                    just before Christmas. I was told that Dick had been denied clearance for
                    Rwanda, for reasons she couldn't tell because that was confidential information.
                    I was devastated. Dick and I had to make a serious decision from pretty awful
                    choices: me to go to Rwanda without Dick; have Dick come without a clearance on
                    our own dimand risk the reason for which he didn't get a clearance; or say “no”
                    to the opportunity. By this time in the bidding cyclwe're in January by now
                    there weren't that many slots open.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>So, as an ambitious Foreign Service officer and happily married woman, I had to
                    confront what was most important to me — meet my values close-up. I decided to
                    turn the job down. Two weeks later I read in the newspaper that President
                    Clinton, who had just taken office, was nominating George Moose as Assistant
                    Secretary of State for African Affairs. I had been George's DCM only a couple of
                    years before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Replacing Hank Cohen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Replacing Hank Cohen. George offered me the job as Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, responsible for transnational issues in Sub-Saharan Africa, i.e.
                    policies relating to democracy, human rights, humanitarian assistance, conflict
                    prevention, conflict resolution, peace keeping, HIV Aids, environment, drugs,
                    bugs, everything that crossed borders for 48 countries. George turned to Ed
                    Brynn as his Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. I had known Ed and his wife,
                    Jane, for a number of years and had great affection for both, so I was really
                    pleased. Ed had responsibility for all of the daily oversight and paperwork of
                    the Bureau. For more than a year, there were only the three of us.</p>
                <p>George had made the decision to bring in experienced ambassadors as Office
                    Directors. He delegated to them the bulk of the responsibilities and
                    decision-making authorities. The Front Office would exercise a light hand. It
                    was a great idea that did not work because the structure and culture of the
                    Department emphasizes centralized control. George's successor, Susan Rice, who
                    came from the NSC changed the structure back. I am sorry no one gave this
                    experiment greater time to work because we are wasting an enormous amount of
                    effectiveness and talent by continuing a 19th century, hierarchical model of
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little about, you got there in the African
                        Bureau just at the time Clinton came in or close to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the spirit then? I think each change of
                        administration is interesting; we look forward to it, not look forward to
                        it, with trepidation. .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Clinton's energy and focus were domestic. He made Tony Lake his
                    National Security Advisor—Tony had served in the State Department and was
                    particularly interested in Africa, so there was a great deal of hope. Warren
                    Christopher, who also had a strong foreign policy background as Deputy Secretary
                    under the Carter administration became Secretary of State. People were pretty
                    optimistic about working with serious and respected people, even if the
                    President didn't have a great background or interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>In the Congress, the Black Caucus was fairly active and concerned about African
                    issues. Randall Robinson, who was well respected, headed up the Africa
                    Institute, a powerful NGO in New York. So, the so-called Africanists, held hope
                    that there would be a greater focus on Africa than there had been in the George
                    H.W. Bush Administration.</p>
                <p>That hope was quickly dashed. I found it extraordinary frustrating. There was a
                    lot of rhetoric about the importance of Africa, but not much else. I would get
                    calls from the Executive Secretary to let us know that Africa Bureau wasn't
                    forward leading enough, whatever the hell that meant. Jennifer Ward, the Africa
                    person at the NSC, would also call us on Tony Lake's behalf to say we weren't
                    doing enough. At the same time, however, the resources were being taken away
                    from us as part of the peace dividend the Administration wanted to provide the
                    public. Brian Atwood, AID Administrator, was removing AID missions from Africa,
                    without advance notice. I would ask my AID counterparts whom I really liked as
                    human beings, about rumors of closings and they would say, “I'm sorry Pru, we
                    can't tell you that.” And I'd say, “Who in the hell are you, the CIA!” I mean,
                    for heaven's sake.</p>
                <p>How we could possibly be forward leaning in this environment was and is beyond
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was behind the “don't tell” what we're going to do
                        thing? Was this something of Brian Atwood? I mean, it makes no sense at
                        all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Brian was very concerned that AID would be made subservient to the
                    Departmenas, in fact it has. But it went further than that. When the Soviet
                    Union broke up, then-Secretary Jim Baker made what I consider a disastrous
                    decision to open 18 new embassies without additional resources. It may have been
                    good politics or gratifying self indulgence but it was lousy governance. We had
                    to find the resources somewhere and since we no longer needed support of African
                    countries in international arenas, it made sense to look to the sub-Sahara. The
                    '93 tragedy in Somalia when American servicemen were killed and dragged through
                    the streets....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, the black hawk down..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. Africa did not look as though it was going to deliver
                    development or private investment results any time soon — so why continue? Brian
                    Atwood needed the resources for the Newly Independent States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Well, I can also understand another reason why, he
                        didn't want to tell State. It would produce a tremendous bureaucratic
                        battle.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, it was a strategy I understood and disagreed with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did George deal with this?</hi>

                <p>BUSHNELL: George was trying to maintain good relations with his AID counterparts
                    and make the best of a bad situation. George is a genuinely nice person and a
                    natural diplomat. He and I had sort of a Mutt and Jeff routine.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good cop, bad cop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. It was a natural fit from the relationship we had established
                    as ambassador and DCM. The ambassador never gives bad news, that's the deputy's
                    job. I wasn't long in the job before I became aware that I had to learn new
                    behaviors or be invisible. The interagency environment is rough, tough and
                    nasty. Interrupting; putting people down, sometimes under the guise of poking
                    fun; using information for self aggrandizement or power; invoking the names of
                    senior officials as if they are your best friends; all sorts of ugly ways of
                    interacting were the norm. I knew I could learn to do this things but I
                    hesitated for fear I'd turn into a rotten human being. I made the decision
                    explicitly and consciously to adapt those behaviors. I did what I thought I had
                    to do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That's right. That's the way the game is playelike the Russian in
                    Bombay who tried to shove me out of the way to be first in line. It's not
                    personal. I think it's very much of a guy thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Sure, when necessary. But among many of my women colleagues there was a
                    greater emphasis on the problem, rather than the person. It was a real pleasure
                    to see the number of women around the table. The White House had a rulI think it
                    was started under Bush senior and I know it was the case with Clinton — that the
                    short list of people being suggested for ambassadorial, DCM, assistant secretary
                    and deputy assistant secretary appointments had to include the name of at least
                    one woman and one minority. For the most part, we women had a different style.
                    We could argue our position and treat one another as decent human beings.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: Warren Christopher made it his personal agenda to deal with the Middle
                    East. His number two, Strobe Talbot came with a great interest in Russia, so he
                    was focusing there and on the newly independent states. China, Japan and North

                        When we pulled out of there was there a palpable, boy we're not going to
                        intervene in anything again or something like that? Was that a mantra in the
                        African Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was an unspoken mantra by the White House. Africa issues, unless
                    they turned into disasters, seldom made it to the seventh floor, where the top
                    of the hierarchy worked. I think I mentioned that there were three of us in the
                    AF front office for a time. George Moose, Ed Brynn and me. We all had portfolios
                    that cut across the 48 countries of Sub-Sahara Africa. But, because some
                    countries needed particular attention from the “sixth floor,” the assistant
                    secretary's office, we divided the hot spots among us. George got the most
                    critical — South Africa, which was then in transition, Sudan and Somalia. Ed got
                    Nigeria and, I don't remember which other two. I took Rwanda, Burundi and
                    Liberia. This was early summer of '93.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>A good deal of my time was spent trying to get the interagency to agree to
                    sending UN peacekeepers to Rwanda to implement peace accords that had put an end
                    to a civil war between the government of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front,
                    or RPF. The RPF had fought the government to a standstill and the peace
                    agreement, called the Arusha Accords, spelled out a political transition. UN
                    peacekeepers were needed to ensure that it would be implemented peacefully. The
                    members of the RPF and the Rwandan government came hand-in-hand to Washington
                    and New York to ask for peace keeping troops. My colleagues and I had to make
                    the case that it was in the interest of the United States to back the Rwanda
                    request.</p>
                <p>The Congress, meanwhile, wanted to reduce the percent the U.S. government was
                    paying for UN peace keeping missions. The NSC was developing criteria to
                    determine U.S. response to future requests. I learned that summer that when the
                    bureaucracy doesn't want to say yes and lacks the guts to say no, it asks for
                    more and more paperwork. To meet the newly developing policy, we essentially had
                    to show that Rwanda peacekeeping would be swift, cheap, blood-free and
                    successful. It was a terribly frustrating summer. Eventually, the U.S.
                    government was strong-armed by the UN and the French to support the Rwandan
                    peace. We wanted to get out of Somalia and further internationalize the
                    peacekeepers there, the UN needed a peacekeeping success and the French wanted
                    peacekeepers in Rwanda. As I observed from the sidelines, a deal was struck.</p>
                <p>A small peacekeeping contingent made up of Belgians and African nations, under
                    the command of Canadian General Romeo Dallaire would oversee the installation of
                    an interim government that would hold democratic elections at some stated point
                    in the future. They entered Rwanda under Chapter Six authoriti.e. to maintain
                    rather than make peace. Weapons could be used only for self defense.</p>
                <p>The transition got stuck and I went to Rwanda in March of '94 to tell all parties
                    to the peace accords that they had to get on with it or risk the possible
                    pull-out of peacekeepers. Little did I know at the time that this was precisely
                    what the radical group of Hutus wanted.</p>
                <p>Let me step back a minute for a thumbnail history lesson so that events to come
                    make sense. Rwanda was a Belgium colony until the late 1950s. Belgians ruled
                    indirectly through the government structures that were dominated by Tutsis, a
                    minority ethnic group. At independence, the majority Hutus took over the
                    government and threw out thousands of Tutsis in a bloody war. Most ended up as
                    refugees in neighboring Burundi and Uganda. It was the sons and daughters of
                    these refugees who created the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and invaded to
                    regain their rightful place.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>The transition government and the military created by the Peace Accords would
                    include both members of the RPF and the government. Extremist Hutus felt they
                    had been sold out and started making demands the RPF would not accept.
                    Meanwhile, the country was becoming increasingly polarized as politicians
                    exploited Hutu fears and targeted Tutsis as the cause of all evil. During my
                    visit, I met with all of the parties counseling compromise. At the time we were
                    aware of selected killings of Tutsis but we held to the belief that if we could
                    get the Peace Accords implemented, the killings would stop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not the major killing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, these were individual deaths, not the mass slaughter we saw later.
                    There were lists on both sides, but we were particularly aware of Tutsi deaths.
                    When I met with the heads of the RPF, I was told that Hutus wanted to
                    exterminate all Tutsis but there was absolutely no evidence, or even hint of
                    thaat least that we saw. We were proven tragically wrong.</p>
                <p>In point of fact, we were distracted by concerns for violence in Burundi, where
                    there was also a Tutsi-Hutu split. Here, the Tutsis had retained power over the
                    majority Hutu population through terrible killings. There were rumors of a coup
                    d'etat when I was in Rwanda, so my travel companion and I rushed to Bujumbura.
                    We sat on the veranda of the Ambassador's residence over-looking a beautiful,
                    green city and hearing gun shots. People were terribly concerned about possible
                    return of wide scale violence so we decided that I would speak publicly on radio
                    and television to call for an end to the bloodshed. Our embassy had seen cease
                    fires work when outsiders came to town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your French of course came into?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. After five years in Senegal, my French came back, so this was
                    easy for me to do. I went on TV and radio and called for a halt to the killing.
                    The next day when I went downtown, a couple of people came up and said, “Are you
                    the woman who was on television, thank you, the killing stopped last night.” I
                    was very moved.</p>
                <p>A couple of weeks after that March trip, back in Washington, I was Acting
                    Assistant Secretary — both George and Ed were out of towwhen the plane carrying
                    both the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi was shot out of the sky as it was
                    landing in Kigali, Rwanda. Within hours, barricades went up in the streets,
                    moderate Hutu and Tutsi politicians were sought out and killed, and the
                    slaughter of Tutsis began.</p>
                <p>Had my husband, Dick, been given a medical clearance, I would have been in Kigali
                    dealing with disaster. Instead, I was in Washington dealing with disaster. As I
                    said earlier, it was the first time I began to believe in destiny.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The first order of business was the welfare of American citizens. Kigali was in
                    chaos. The parts of the military were going door to door with lists to kill the
                    people inside. The RPF troops came out of their barricades; fire fights began in
                    the streets. We advised all Americans to stay home and stay down so our
                    information was limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This obviously had been planned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, although we had no idea at the time to what extent the killing
                    would continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: David Rawson, who was unable to get to the embassy for a couple of
                    days. Remember, the President of Burundi had also been killed, so we were very
                    nervous about what would happen there, as well. We set up an emergency 24 hour
                    task force, which I was to head, and I called Ed, who was on vacation, to ask
                    him to come home!</p>
                <p>The French were concerned about their nationals; there were many more of them
                    than Americans. While they began to make plans to evacuate French citizens from
                    the Kigali airport, we made the daring decision to send Americans out overland
                    to neighboring countries. This was David Rawson's idea and a good one. Kigali
                    was a killing zone. It made no sense to ask Americans around the countrmany of
                    them, missionaries — to come into the city and wait to be rescued by the French
                    when they could more easily go over the nearest border to Tanzania, Burundi or
                    Zaire (now Congo), whichever was closest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were other embassies, for example, calling us, saying,
                        “What are you doing”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, yes. We were coordinating with a number of governments,
                    particularly the French and the Belgians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem with the missionaries, because often
                        I've talked to people who have said that missionaries tend to hang on to the
                        last..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, they were pretty solid folks; they understood the danger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Been around for a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: One group caused a great deal of anxiety because they had taken refuge
                    in a compound that was overrun by Hutu militia. They bribed the men into leaving
                    but were concerned they would come back. This was not an easy evacuation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about local employees, Rwandans, particularly Tutsi?
                        Were they coming going out with us or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. This will forever scar our reputation among Foreign Service
                    Nationals. The agreement brokered with Rwandan government and military was that
                    the overland convoys would contain ex-patriots only. We left everyone else
                    behind. To be fair, we had no idea what was to come. Still....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there had been a record of several of these Hutu -
                        Tutsi conflicts which had not reached the proportions that this one did. So
                        that, you know, based on past experience, you could say, this is terrible,
                        but we'll get out, we'll come back and it will settle down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That was the rationale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get any help in making decisions by
                        getting background from the CIA or INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Remember I told you about the AID pulling out of Africa? Well, AID
                    wasn't the only one pulling out of Africa. The CIA was pulling out of Africa. We
                    had no intelligence capability except for a roving Defense Intelligence officer
                    stationed elsewhere.</p>
                <p>INR and CIA in Washington were giving us as much as they had, but it was pretty
                    difficult. Once we pulled out officially we had no eyes or ears, with the
                    exception of one American ex-pat who stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the French, the Belgium and the
                        Canadian embassies as this thing started to develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think the Canadians may have gone with us. Anyway, the discussions
                    about the evacuations were taking place among the militaries. So, I was talking
                    to the U.S. military who were talking to the Belgium and the French militaries.
                    I didn't engage directly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French usually had a fairly substantial force in
                        Africa but their response time wouldn't be that great, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The extremists had taken over the airport. The Belgium peacekeepers who
                    were guarding the woman who was to become interim Prime Minister were taken,
                    killed and mutilated. The Prime Minister was killed in front of her children and
                    mutilated. Before the French or anyone could come in, they needed to secure the
                    airport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in charge because you were acting secretary for
                        African affairs. How much of a part did the seventh floor or the National
                        Security Council play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Other than concern for a prominent human rights advocate who had met
                    President Clinton, the NSC didn't play much of a role. The seventh floor did. I
                    came to the operation center very early one morning, about day two after the
                    crisis started, and three senior people stopped me to say “Pru, the President
                    called Secretary Christopher and the Secretary of Defense to say that he wants
                    every American out alive. Good luck.” As if I needed an order from the President
                    to bring people out safely. Anyway, I felt that the waters had parted and there
                    I was. Fortunately, not alone. I had a great team.</p>
                <p>It soon became clear, however, that decisions had to be made swiftly, much faster
                    than our bureaucracy would allow. For example, the order to evacuate took more
                    than a day to get through the clearance process. So, Beth Jones, the Secretary's
                    Executive Assistant, and I worked an arrangement. Any time I needed a decision
                    from Secretary Christopher, I would contact her. She would get immediate access
                    and a verbal response to whatever it was. On the basis of that response, I was
                    authorized to take action. The clearance papers would follow a parallel track.
                    It worked well. While the overland evacuations were pretty nerve-wracking
                    because we had no radio contact once the last convoy left the embassy, we got
                    all Americans out alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Americans are out, but all hell was breaking loose. I
                        mean it was one of the great catastrophes of our time. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was awful, one of the worse periods of my life. As awful as the
                    bombing of the embassy in Nairobi was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The bombing was finite period, but this, I mean to have a
                        rolling genocide going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: And not being able to do anything. I will never forget the look in the
                    eyes of Kevin Aiston, the Rwanda/Burundi desk officer when I told him that the
                    NSC and Secretary Christopher had made the decision to call for the withdrawal
                    of the UN peacekeepers. I mean, everybody knew, or at least suspected what was
                    going to happen.</p>
                <p>There were already two dynamics occurring in Rwanda—a civil war between the
                    Rwandan government military and the RPF, and the wholesale slaughter of
                    civilianmainly Tutsiby militias and other civilians. Tens of thousands used
                    machetes and farm instruments to kill their neighbors. This was a government
                    controlled, systematic and well planned effort to use as many Hutus as possible
                    to kill all Tutsis. The authors of the genocide deliberately induced an entire
                    society to murder so that everybody would have life on his or her hands. The
                    government structure was highly centralized, the infrastructure was
                    excellenthanks to the U.S. and other donorand people were used to doing what
                    they were told. Instructions would come from Kigali. The parts of the military
                    that were not fighting the civil war took part. They used the radio, which was
                    the primary means of mass communication as in many African countries, to exhort
                    people to slaughter. Tutsis were taking refuge in stadiums, in schools, and in
                    churches. In the past when Tutsis had taken refuge to the churches, they had
                    been saved. This time, the Hutus used priests and ministers to call people into
                    so-called safe havens. They'd pack them in, hurl a couple of grenades, then go
                    in to hack survivors to death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds like almost a dramatic going back to the
                        Holocaust planning of this thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lists, implicate people. In other words, this was not in a
                        way of or in any way a spontaneous thing. This was a carefully thought out
                        sort of almost physiological way of how we're going to handle this
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes it was. It was planned by Hutu extremists as they participated in
                    peace talks. And I will go to my grave wondering why we didn't see it coming.
                    Nor did we ever do an after-action review or anything like that to figure out
                    what blinded us and what needs to change so it doesn't happen again. Sometimes I
                    think we don't want to learn from mistakes so we will have the flexibility to
                    employ them again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had this sort of thing occurred or seeing glimmers of this
                        in past? I mean, there had been this Hutu Tutsi thing both there and in
                        Burundi. Had you seen this almost methodical way of dealing with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah, but not like this. There had been paroxysms of killings in both
                    countries, but never to this extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because one doesn't think of Africa as being caught up in
                        sort of the philosophy that the German anti Semitism was. But, this is great
                        parallel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: On the surface.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this was going on, did you have the feeling that we
                        were looking over our shoulder at the government at developments in the
                        Balkans and the whole idea was, boy this isn't our business, we don't want
                        to get involved. Was this a factor or was this not a factor in what we would
                        do or not do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, there was every reason in the book why we weren't doing what we
                    could have or should have. Tony Lake, Clinton National Security Advisor, later
                    said that the phones weren't ringing. He was right but I wonder why we should
                    adopt that as a criteria for intervening in the mass slaughter of civilians. The
                    Washington Post editorials were saying this sort of ethnic violence in an
                    African country in which we had no interests was none of our business. Now mind
                    you, the slaughter was taking place at an un-precedented rate. I mean hundreds
                    of thousands of people a day. In a hundred days, I think eight to nine hundred
                    thousand people were killed. And in the mean time we were listing reasons why we
                    couldn't do anything. That's incredible!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And most of it by machetes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Up close and personal, right. I remember meeting with my team one day
                    and asking how people could physically sustain the energy to keep hacking up
                    human beings.</p>
                <p>The policy garlic and crucifixes were up all around the Department — and
                    Washington, for that matter. I'd sometimes report what was happening at Strobe
                    Talbott's morning staff meetings and get looks of horror around the table but
                    nothing else. My team and I were free to do whatever we wanted as long as we
                    didn't use any American resources, ask anyone to use theirs, or augment the tiny
                    peacekeeping unit left behind when the UN pulled the bulk of them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, even after the slaughter of the Belgium's at the
                        airport, was the UN saying hey, we can't do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, General Dallaire was furiously sending messages and was, I think,
                    dumbstruck at the decision to withdraw the peacekeepers. The only reason a few
                    were left behind is that thousands of Tutsis had taken refuge in a stadiums in
                    Kigalas they had all over the countrand to withdraw the limited protection they
                    had would really be over the top. It was amazing the effectiveness of a very
                    few. There were too few of them to save the hundreds of thousands of lives lost,
                    but those who stayed were unharmed.</p>
                <p>It was just so bizarre and horrible a period. A massive slaughter going on; a
                    civil war going on; an international community sitting on its hands and watching
                    in horror; and a tiny group of mid level people at State frantically trying to
                    think of ways to stop the killing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it the Pentagon was adamant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I called the men in the Joint Chief Staff and the Office of the
                    Secretary of Defense the “no way, no how, and not with our toys boys,” because
                    they stoned-walled every effort. I chaired these God awful interagency video
                    conferences. We'd sit in this tiny airless room looking at four TV monitorNSC,
                    CIA, and two for DOD and talk with clenched jaws about what could be done. I at
                    least wanted the hate radio that was encouraging people to continue the genocide
                    to be jammed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a movie called Hotel Rwanda with excerpts of
                        talking about killing the cockroaches. There was a fairly good
                        representation, was it or not, did you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I have chosen not to see the movie, but, yes, the part about the radio
                    was accurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can understand why you wouldn't want to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The discussion about jamming the radios was pretty reflective of the
                    other conversations we'd have. The first thing I was told is that jamming is
                    against international law. Then I was told it would be too expensive, then that
                    DOD didn't have the planes, and finally, that all of the jamming equipment was
                    being used in Haiti. One excuse after another. At one point, a JCS colleagues
                    leaned forward to admonish me: “Pru, radios don't kill people, people kill
                    people.” I told him that I would quote him on that and actually did. When Debra
                    Winger played me in the movie Sometimes in April I had them put it in the
                    script.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Out of total desperation, I got on every international radio network broadcasting
                    to Africa that I could. I remembered what had happened in Burundi and thought
                    I'd give it a try. What a pathetic thing to do. I kept wondering where were the
                    voices of the international communitand especially the Pope. Rwanda was
                    predominantly Catholic. Why we heard nothing from the Vatican is another
                    question I think deserves an answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with young officers or mid career
                        officers presiding over something like this? Any resignations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No resignations or even any thoughtwe were in the thick of it and
                    didn't have time to think about much else. We were trying to keep abreast of
                    informatioremember, we had lost our eyes and ears with the closing of the
                    embassand come up with plans of what we could do.</p>
                <p>One of the things I did was to contact the Chief of Staff of the Rwanda military
                    to let him know that we knew what was going on and wanted an end of it
                    immediately. My talking points were to call for a cease fire and return to the
                    Peace Accords. Under the circumstances that was pretty ridiculous, but there you
                    go. I would set the alarm for 2 am because it would be 8:00 a.m. in Kigali. I'd
                    go downstairs so I wouldn't wake Dick and use the wall phone in the kitchen.
                    We'd have these bizarre conversations. I'd tell him to stop killing people and
                    he'd respond “Oh, but Madame, there's a civil war going on. I don't have the
                    troops to stop this spontaneous uprising.” When I advised him to at least stop
                    the hate radio, he said “But, madame, we are a democracy. We have freedom of the
                    press.” I mean he was really ridiculous.</p>
                <p>I'd also telephone Paul Kagame, the commander of the Rwanda Patriotic Front.
                    These were equally strange but very different conversations. I had the same
                    talking points — urging cease fire and return to Peace Accords. His reaction was
                    astonishment: “Excuse me Madam, there's a genocide going on. At least we're
                    keeping the military occupied. You want me to stop fighting?? A cease fire would
                    only make it easier for them.” We will never know if that would have been the
                    case, but I understood his position.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought of supporting the RPF because of the

                <p>BUSHNELL: No.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: In Rwanda, since independence, the Tutsis were the persecuted ones. In
                    Burundi, although Hutus are a majority there as well, the Tutsis have retained
                    power often through large scale violence. We did not favor one or the other.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We were keeping a very close eye on Burundi and were thankful “IT” did
                    not happen there. I remember all of a sudden one day, I had a flash of insight:
                    “IT” was already happening but in a different way. In Burundi, killings had been
                    going on for years there, but not at the ferocious level you saw in Rwanda
                    during the genocide. As unacceptable as killings were, they were not dire enough
                    to attract international attention.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Journalists were there. Initially we thought that if we could get
                    cameras to film what was going on, people would stop killing. They didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. Was Congress doing anything on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just something nobody wanted to touch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Nobody wanted to touch this thing. I remember going to a congressional
                    hearing and being scolded by Donald Payne, a member of the Black Caucus. “You're
                    not doing enough in Rwanda.” I was so indignant. I wasn't doing enough? I'm the
                    one who is supposed to do more?! He finally had to say, “Not you! Not you
                    personally, I mean you the Clinton administration!” I can't recall any other
                    gesture made by the Congress.</p>
                <p>The genocide finally came to an end when the RPF under Kagame's command soundly
                    walloped the Rwandan military. At that point, the Rwandan government ordered a
                    massive evacuation of the country. I mean the entire country! In Washington we
                    went from watching in horror, a genocide, to witnessing in shock the exit of
                    literally tens of thousands of people, streaming across borderespecially to
                    Zairwith everything they could take. Communities stayed together as they
                    installed themselves on the other side of the border. Everything remained highly
                    organized.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>It was as this was going on that the French decided to intervene with Operation
                    Turquoise. They claimed they were sick of watching the genocide and decided to
                    take unilateral action. However, they waited until the government they had
                    supported was fleeing across the border before implementing their “noble”
                    aspiration. Essentially, they put themselves between the fleeing government and
                    military, which they had supported for years, and the RPF, whom they despised
                    and mistrusted. I remember phone conversations between George Moose and Paul
                    Kagame, who was absolutely incensed at the French. “You do not want to kill the
                    French,” George would argue, ultimately successfully. Meanwhile, people with
                    their household effects on their heads or in carts continued streaming across
                    the border toward another humanitarian catastrophe..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were mainly Hutu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: These were Hutus. They emptied the countryside. Our interagency meeting
                    took an abrupt turn to focus on what in the world we were going to do with
                    thousands and thousands of people camped along volcanoes in Zairhardly a country
                    known for its stability or government effectiveness.</p>
                <p>Once the RPF took over Rwanda, I was sent to check things out. It was yet another
                    surreal experience. The country side of one of the most populous countries in
                    the world was literally deadly quiet. Berries ready to harvest were rotting on
                    the coffee trees; houses stood vacant. The man who served as the ambassador's
                    driver drove us. When we were stopped by child soldiers at checkpoints, I
                    learned never to look them in the eye. As we drove we heard the story of how the
                    driver had hidden and what happened to some of the other embassy employees. Many
                    were dead.</p>
                <p>I participated in a memorial service for the FSNs who were killed. I will never
                    forget looking into the stony faces of employees who had been abandoned by the
                    US government. American officers who came up to speak would weep, to a person.
                    The Rwandans just looked at us. I can only imagine what they were thinking and
                    the trauma that was still with them.</p>
                <p>Kigali was a mess. The government had taken everything, including the cash. What
                    role does the international community play now? Here is a devastated country in
                    which the victims of genocide became the victors of a civil war. That had never
                    happened before. No one wanted to be associated with a government that may want
                    to take revenge, but not helping meant punishing the victims even more. I sat on
                    the sidelines of some of these Friends of Rwanda meetings watching one
                    government representative after another asking:” What are you going to do?” “
                    Don't know what are you going to do? “ For a while it just went in circles.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>One of the greatest ironies to this was that during most of the genocide, the
                    government that was perpetrating the killings held the presidency of the
                    Security Council. They were not asked to leave until the very end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was a much easier and more straightforward to help the refugees who
                    had fled to Zaire. That was something the international community was accustomed
                    to. When cholera broke out, we rushed in. The Vice President 's wife even went
                    over, to our horror. I'm not at all sure that she recognized that many of the
                    people showing up for photo ops could have been among those who had hacked their
                    neighbors to death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's easier to do something about humanitarian
                        things than to stop people from killing people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: By this point I was pretty miserable and getting burned out. The former
                    government's military and militias began to control the refugee camps and claim
                    the food that was to go to the people. The intimidation of humanitarian workers
                    and refugees was whole scale. Then raids into Rwanda from these camps began.
                    Paul Kagame, who was now the Vice President of Rwanda, said repeatedly, “If you,
                    international community don't do something to stop these guys, I'm going to.” We
                    didn't; he did. And therein lay the beginning of the conflict in the Great Lakes
                    area of Africa which continues to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, his troops went in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. But first he had to get as many refugees as possible back in
                    Rwanda. You can't have a country with that proportion of population sitting
                    across the border. Initially, the militias tried to stop people from returning
                    but Rwandans clearly understood there was no future for them on the volcanoes of
                    Zaire. So many took the chance and returned. I think for the most part Kagame
                    made good on his promise to create efforts of reconciliation, as well as to
                    bring the perpetrators of the genocide to justice.</p>
                <p>What an undertaking that wabringing people to justice. Tens of thousands of
                    people had participated; tens of thousands were in jail under deplorable
                    conditions. I visited one of the prisons. All of the inmates, male and
                    femalethey were kept separatelwere clothed in bright pink polyester. Some of the
                    prisons were so crowded people had to sleep in shifts. How do you keep decent
                    conditions in the jails when the country has no money? Should the international
                    community help? I mean, we “don't do” jails as a rule.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The U.S. government did become very involved in establishing a tribunal in Arusha
                    to hold accountable the authors of the genocide. Another irony here: under
                    international law, the death penalty was off the table. In Rwanda, it was not.
                    The people taking orders to kill could possible be put to death, while those who
                    gave the orders would not. Recently, I think Rwanda has done away with the death
                    penalty.</p>
                <p>Can we stop pretty soon? I'm sorry, I'm run down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. I've got these two questions. This is not a fun
                        interview, but it's vital. I'm told that during this crisis , not only the
                        State Department, but the U.S. military wanted to bring the non governmental
                        organizations into the planning earlier. Did you find that the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, actually no, because the U.S. military successfully kept out
                    Rwanda. I guess they were involved in some respect in bringing humanitarian
                    assistance supplies in to Zaire. But, on the whole, the US military did not
                    become very involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This could be the topic of another interview, because I
                        think the portfolio of African peace keepers is part of your thing. We could
                        talk about that on another interview. What about in this thing, what was the
                        role of Madeline Albright who is our ambassador to the United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think she understood more clearly than other policy makers what would
                    happen if the peacekeepers were withdrawn. I know she regrets what happened.
                    President Clinton apologized, too. Fine, but as I said earlier, the U.S.
                    government to my knowledge has still made no effort to find out what really
                    happened and what we have to learn from the Rwanda debacle. General Romeo
                    Dallaire was sending cables back to the UN warning them of the preparations for
                    genocide three months before it started and I did not know about them. Why? Why
                    didn't a small diplomatic community in country to facilitate peace know about
                    the preparations as late as March, when I visited? If I had the guts or the
                    stomach for it, I would think about doing the research myself, but I don't want
                    to. I feel badly enough now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're probably not the person to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, actually I'm not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something like this needs somebody outside really. What
                        about the NSC? This is the last question on this session. What about the
                        role of the NSC during this whole thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Richard Clark was the head of Global Affairs and Peace Keeping of the
                    NSC. Susan Rice, his deputy was to take over in the second term of Clinton
                    Administration as assistant secretary for African Affairs. Dick Clark is the one
                    person to this day who will look you in the eye and say, “We did exactly the
                    right thing in Rwanda.” On the other hand, Tony Lake the National Security
                    Advisor at the time talks at length about his regrets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any of the rationale for that? Not to get
                        involved was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: “We had no interest in that country”. “Look at what they did to Belgian
                    peacekeepers.” “It takes too long to put a peacekeeping operation together.”
                    “What would our exit strategy be?” “These things happen in Africa.” “We couldn't
                    have stopped it.” I could go on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, we'll stop at this point and we'll pick this
                        up the next time. We've talk a lot about Rwanda. I don't know if there's
                        anything else we should cover there, but we did want to talk about African
                        troops as peace keepers. This was part of your portfolio, right. Liberia
                        will come up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 5th of August, 2005. Pru, welcome to the world of the retirees.</p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Thank you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. Well, let's talk about Liberia. What years are we
                        talking about again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I was Deputy Assistant Secretary from '93 to '95 and Principal DAS, '95
                    to '96.</p>
                <p>There is one final issue about Rwanda and then we can move on. That's the issue
                    of when and whether we should have called the slaughter a genocide. Like the
                    decision to remove peacekeepers when the killings started, the discussion of
                    genocide was not one in which my team and I were included. As far as I knew,
                    those conversations were taking place at the White House, not within the Bureau
                    of African Affairs. Reference to those discussions would come up in George
                    Moose's staff meetings, but what I was focused on was figuring out ways to stop
                    the killing. I know that using the term genocide would put us in a position of
                    having to do something, hence the reluctance. Of course, we've learned from
                    Darfur that we can call in genocide and still continue to wring our hands. In
                    '94, however, we hadn't yet had that precedent. In my narrow and hellish world,
                    whether we called the killing genocide or not was moot. We weren't going to do
                    anything to stop it. I don't know what this contributes to history but from my
                    perspective, the conversation about genocide was political, not actionable.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. I mean, so often Washington buzzes around, and this
                        time we're talking about people getting killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. It boils down to the following. Domestic policy considerations
                    now dominate foreign affairs, no matter which administration we are under, and
                    those policies are usually not advantageous to African people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, to look at it in perspective and to be fair,
                        government, don't move quickly. This thing burst forth in such a hurry that
                        there wasn't time to really crank up. I mean, eventually the Bosnian one
                        played out over a long time. It got worse and worse, but there's plenty of
                        time to try this, try that and all that. But, Rwanda was sort of like a wild
                        fire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: In addition, you have the tension between national interest and moral
                    imperative. I could and did make the argument that it was not in our national
                    interest to intervene. Should we to send young Americans into a domestic fire
                    fight, possibly to be killed on behalf of people we don't know in a country in
                    which we have no particular interest? From the perspective of national interest,
                    people like Richard Clarke will argue we did things right. In terms of moral
                    imperative there is no doubt in my mind that we did not do the right thing. I
                    could have a clear bureaucratic conscience from Washington's stand point and
                    still have a soul filled with shame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, turning to Africa as a whole. What was the
                        peacekeeping apparatus in Africa through the UN or through the
                        organizations, African states or what have you, at the time you were there?
                        How did you view it; how effective was it and how was it used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: During my tenure we were working with the Organization of African Unity
                    (OAU) to create a crisis monitoring operation at their headquarters. It was
                    fairly modest. After Rwanda, we became more serious about the need for African
                    regional forces and started the Africa Crisis Response Initiative, which has
                    since grown into a regional force under the auspices of the African Uniothe
                    successor to the OAU. Meanwhile, UN peacekeeping remained the most popular
                    because contributing governments got paid, received equipment, etc. The numbers
                    of countries that had militaries sufficiently well trained and disciplined to go
                    in to UN peace keeping was fairly small, however. African regional organizations
                    like ECOWAEconomic Community of West African Statealso had a peacekeeping
                    function. They were instrumentawith questionable effectivenesin Liberia. It was
                    after the Rwanda disaster that the U.S. government became keen about Africa
                    regional peacekeeping, which eventually turned into an arm of the African
                    Union.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about ECOWAS. It seems like Nigeria is first
                        and The Gambia was second of sending troops out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Senegal, as well. They were very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senegal, well yeah. Senegal's troops were first rate in
                        World War II. How did we view Nigeria? I mean, you had a very corrupt
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Had a very corrupt military, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the military corrupt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, yes. Liberia was also in my portfolio so I would go there now and
                    then. On one of these occasions I was standing on the tarmac with our
                    ambassador, Bill Twaddell, watching a plane being loaded up to head back toward
                    Lagos. We were pretty sure the cargo was illicit stufdiamonds, gold or drugs.
                    The corruption among the Nigerians in Liberia was well known. On the other hand,
                    Liberia had a multi-faceted civil war going on and the Nigerians were
                    controlling at least part of the country, maintaining a peace of some sorts. So,
                    as corrupt as these peacekeepers may have been, we were even more concerned
                    about what would happen if they left Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other ones that were active, like
                        Senegal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Senegal fulfilled its commitment and suffered some losses, then got
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did these troops that went use Liberia? Did they act
                        the role of occupiers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It depended on the military. Nigerians who occupied Monrovia did. Poor
                    Liberia. It was divided up into territories under the control of warlords who
                    represented different ethnic groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Liberia was the second big problem wasn't it for you at
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. Rwanda and Burundi were lumped together because what happened in
                    one had such repercussions in the other. Liberia was a different issue. First of
                    all, it is a country in which we have an historic interest, unlike Rwanda or
                    Burundi. Liberia was settled by former American slaves and Monrovia named after
                    James Monroe. We used the country for our radio relay stations during the Cold
                    War and had strong ties. The Liberians had equally strong expectations that we
                    would intervene in some way, but we did not.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>George Moose would send me to Liberia now and then to bawl out the warlords but
                    we had no active involvement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways, when I talk to people about Liberia, the
                        main concern is when do we haul our embassy people out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think it's been evacuated eight times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. I mean, if it weren't so tragic it would be
                        ludicrous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: On the other hand we did not want to signal the Liberian people that we
                    were washing our hands of them. Even if we could do no more than be present, we
                    were determined to at least be present. I don't argue with that as long as there
                    are colleagues brave and willing enough to go there. So, we had a fairly minimal
                    presence that we could pull out and put back in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When people went there, during the time you were there,
                        did they go unaccompanied?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Initially I think spouses were there, but certainly not children. I'm
                    not sure about its current status now that Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is
                    president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any strategic interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: With the end of the Cold War, no. Liberia has lots of resources, but we
                    were not particularly interested in those..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the characters that we were having to
                        deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Ha! Characters is right, none of them anyone you would want to meet.
                    The most long lasting war lord was Charles Taylor. I went to his “capital” was
                    in Gbarnga, which was in the middle of the jungle, via UN helicopter to deliver
                    a demarche. He made us wait an absurd amount of time and by the time we finally
                    got to see him in his throne room, as I called it, I was hungry and very
                    irritated. Then he talk, and talked and talked. I have an agreement with myself
                    that I will allow men to talk at me without taking a breath for only a certain
                    amount of timusually, 15 minutes for Americans, 25 for Africans. About 30
                    minutes into his monologue, Taylor began to call me “my dear.” Twice I decided
                    to ignore him. The third time I had had it. I interrupted him suggesting that he
                    never again call a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the United States of America
                    “my dear.” He accused me of being culturally insensitive and told me he called
                    everyone my dear. I retorted that I would call him Mr. President and he could
                    call me either Ms. Bushnell or Madame Secretary. By this time, he had lost his
                    rhythm to say nothing of face, and he ordered us out. He told the UN
                    peacekeeping commander never to let me back in. I found out recently that Taylor
                    really did call everyone “my dear.” Still, I have no regrets at my action.</p>
                <p>Another war lord was Roosevelt Johnson. I met him on the same trip to Liberia
                    with the same message: stop it. Johnson reveled in telling how Charles Taylor's
                    soldiers would kill people, slit open their chests and eat their hearts. I think
                    he was trying to impress me so, of course I refused to show it. The last one I
                    saw on that trip was El Hadji Kromah in yet another part of Liberia. To get to
                    him we had to go through checkpoints of child soldiers who were often high on
                    drugs. It was frightening. We sat in a living room with walls decorated with
                    bullet shells. I had to use his bathroom and he locked me in. My first thought
                    was that he didn't like my message and was going to keep my hostage. Actually,
                    he had done it because there was no way to keep the door closed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we want to go to Liberia and why did they want to
                        see us? We were not a player were we, or were we a player?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: As I say, we had a long and strong relationship with Liberia. While
                    European governments maintained close relations with their former colonies,
                    Liberia was considered ours, even though it was never a colony. We have always
                    recognized that we cannot completely turn our backs on Liberia and therefore, we
                    will continue to do what we can do to bring peace to that very rich resource
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the French since the '60s have maintained
                        significant troops; I mean effective troops which have kept out a lot of the
                        nonsense. There's nothing like a battalion of paratroopers arriving in the
                        capitol to make people calm down. Were we thinking of something of that
                        nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, we would never do that. The French relationship with their former
                    colonies is very different, because they have considerable commercial interests,
                    as well as continuing political interest in these countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the battles that were raging in the State
                        Department and the National Security Council about Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We were providing some financial and equipment support to ECOWAS. Not
                    very much but enough to have our concerns recognized. I did whatever I could in
                    interagency peacekeeping meetings to keep us from totaling withdrawing interest.
                    By this time I had learned a little about bureaucratically delaying any final
                    decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Rwanda, the effective Rwanda or Somali playing a role
                        as we looked at Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: More relevant was the scrub that the Clinton administration was doing
                    of all peace keeping around the world. We contributed 31% of all UN peacekeeping
                    operations and wanted to make some sense of where, why, when, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was peacekeeping money part of the fight that was going on
                        between the administration and Senator Helms and others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very much so. The debate still rages about paying our dues to the
                    United Nations and getting reforms in return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get called in from time; I mean did you have to
                        deal with Congress in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I dealt with Congress on countries specific issues. The
                    Political-Military Bureau and the International Organization Bureau had the
                    larger piece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well sometimes, particularly staff members on the Hill
                        would get focused on a country. Did you find any particular parts of Africa
                        of special interest to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: There was a good deal of interest in the civil war in Sudan,
                    particularly among the Christian Right. Angola and Mozambique, as leftovers of
                    the proxy wars in Africa initiated during the Cold War also attracted attention.
                    It's a whole lot easier to start wars than it is to stop them, and peace in
                    these countries was slow in coming. Somalia, of course, was getting negative
                    attention, and Nigeria, the largest country in Africa, has always been
                    important. But the greatest focus was on South Africa. We had huge hopes for
                    that country, which was in transition at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were on duty did you have to evacuate our
                        embassy at all or get involved from Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, yeah. I did a number of evacuation and disaster management gigs,
                    Liberia included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an effort on our part, maybe to the annoyance of
                        the Pentagon to keep the battalions or marines on a landing ship cruising up
                        and down the coast for the next crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah, they were. They certainly were hovering about Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the politics like during the decision making
                        process around evacuations? Ambassadors often don't want to leave but
                        Washington doesn't want any dead bodies, either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Washington has always erred on the side of cautioat least until this
                    Iraq War. If an ambassador showed reluctance or wanted to disagree with
                    Washington's concern, I'd make a phone call to tell him to start saluting.
                    Disagreeing, especially in writing, was not going to help anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned telephone calls. Were you doing during the
                        '90s as the new era of communications came in? We might have still be using
                        the old cables, but there was a lot of consultation on the phone wasn't
                        there? Was there a lot more communication?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I 'm trying to think how much work we did by e-mail. Not nearly the
                    amount of work we do now because a lot of embassies weren't connected. The state
                    of our communications technology at State was shameful. I used the phones a lot.
                    Coming from the administrative side of the house, I continued the tradition of
                    completing whatever negotiation or discussion we needed by phone, then sealing
                    the deal in writing. Much more efficient than arguing through cableunless you
                    wanted it part of the official record.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've heard people say that they were concerned about
                        the initial impact of easy communications, but they found in a way that
                        embassies had really more of a say in matters than before. .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, exactly. I think that one of the unintended consequences of e-mail
                    has been to turn a notion that Washington makes policy and the field implements
                    policy on its head. It really needs to be that way, too. Before, those sitting
                    in the splendors of Washington would issue orders and people on the field would
                    either implement them or ignore them. With e-mail people can actually discuss,
                    educate and craft the instructions together. That's an ambassador's ambitioto
                    craft the official instructions Washington sends. A lot of good policy
                    strategies can come from e-mail consultations and conversations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now we've talked about Liberia. What about Sierra

                <p>BUSHNELL: Foday Sankoh and his thugs were just getting started but not yet the
                    disaster they became. There was a coup in The Gambia; Guinea Bissau was having
                    its ups and downs; Central African Republic had problems.... But, I want to
                    point out that I had more than a conflict portfolio, I also had good things.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: I had the democracy portfolio and there were countries like Mali that
                    were really making progress. In fact, Sierra Leone was desperately trying to
                    have elections. This was before those horrible human beings, those wretched

                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Citizen participation — members of the non-governmental organizations,
                    women's groups, associations and different kinds of civic organizations engaged
                    in efforts to promote political and social welfare issues. I also spent a good
                    deal of time on women's issues, which I strongly believed should have been part
                    of our mainstream policy portfolio. African women play a major role in their
                    societies, even though they are shunted aside. In many countries they're
                    responsible for raising and educating their children, as well as tending the
                    fields and the home. If you say you want to promote democracy you'd better
                    promote the rights of over 50 percent of the citizenry at the same time or
                    you're not walking the talk. I spent a huge amount of time traveling, going to
                    countries people from the front office seldom visited — Guinea Bissau, Chad,
                    Burkina Faso, Niger, ... At every stop I would meet with women. It was a real
                    privilege and one of the best parts of my job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did that translate in what you or the United
                        States is doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Unfortunately, women's issues were relegated to the development
                    assistance portfolio. Policy makers too often see women only as victims in need
                    of economic and humanitarian assistance but that's only part of it. They are
                    also potential political actors. In Rwanda, for example, almost 50% of the
                    parliament is now made up of women because so many men died in the genocide. So,
                    one of the things that I wanted to accomplish in these countries was to bring
                    the Ambassador face-to-face with women as political actors and not just as the
                    subjects of need.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, when you start talking about giving women more power
                        you're upsetting the male dominance and I can see where an ambassador
                        saying, I don't want to tackle this sort of thing, or feel uncomfortable
                        about doing it. Were you able to both move our own apparatus, our own
                        ambassadors and do anything else about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You know, the first human rights reports I worked on in '82 did not
                    include domestic violence because it was considered a cultural issue. So I can't
                    say that the Department or our ambassadors were particularly forward leaning. On
                    the other hand, the Clinton White House was serious about women. Prep for the
                    Beijing Women's Conference had started and people were recognizing a shift. Some
                    ambassadors would quietly go with me or host an event. A couple of them, who
                    just didn't get it, had their spouses host something.</p>
                <p>I was beginning to understand how to use power. As a senior government official I
                    had the power of position. By going out to meet and show respect to women I
                    could bring not only the U.S. Ambassador but also the local press, which helped
                    them. I feel strongly that it's in the interest of the United States Government
                    and certainly is a moral imperative to deal with issues of women.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, diplomacy is changing all the time, at least some of
                        the instruments of diplomacy. Were you seeing a real change by the rise of
                        American and European non governmental agencies, and the NGO organizations
                        in country?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a new, powerful phenomenon. I come from the old
                        Foreign Service and you know, these non governmental organizations were kind
                        of to be avoided. I mean, they did their thing and we stayed away from
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I have mixed feelings. I think they are critical to the good health of
                    a democracy and we were assisting them as alternate service providers in
                    countries that had ineffective and/or corrupt governments. On the other hand,
                    they are special interest groups whose focus is limited to the particular issue
                    they represent. I also wondered about the unintended consequences of pouring
                    money and attention into the non-government sector instead of a country's civil
                    service. Were we were setting up parallel governments? What were we doing to the
                    future of these countries?</p>
                <p>The issue is even more acute with the attention we pay to militaries, to the
                    detriment of public civilian service. We ignore civilian public administrators,
                    teach the armed forces leadership and effectiveness, then gasp in astonishment
                    when inept civilian governments fall in military coups. How can we expect
                    democratic governments to emerge if we're not going to pay attention to its
                    civil servants? There is a need for some strategic thinking about what we are
                    doing and what we are creating as we focus on non-government organizations and
                    militaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the part of Africa you were dealing with, is
                        there any other area for which you were paying quite a bit of
                        attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, HIV/AIDS. This was before the U.S. government recognized it for
                    the catastrophe it is. Some of the dedicated scientists and health professionals
                    made me a true believer and we become the first activists in the foreign policy
                    community. George Moose was one of the first to understand the repercussions.
                    With his backing we commissioned a National Intelligence Estimate, to include an
                    unclassified conclusion about the impact of HIV/AIDS on African militaries and
                    societies. It took me something like eight months to get them to publish their
                    conclusions, even though it was unclassified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I'm not certain. Straight forwardness is not a hallmark of the
                    interagency. I may have been that the conclusions were too dire to be made
                    public without a plan to address the consequences. Let's not talk about this
                    dirty secret. It was, in retrospect, one of my greatest accomplishmentto force
                    the issue and make it public. It was the first time that anything had ever been
                    done about the impact of HIV/AIDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we see to make things better?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Countries that had leaders who understood the impact of HIV/AIDS and
                    made an effort to educate the public had far greater success in arresting it.
                    Senegal is a case in point. They have kept the numbers down through committed
                    efforts. In contrast, Kenyan political, religious and social leaders refused to
                    acknowledge what was happening until the epidemic had spread to unacceptable
                    levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this being treated by other governments? I'm
                        thinking of the major donor countries and the UN. Were we on our own or were
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I know that we were in the forefront. The United States was targeting
                    resources to it. There was a certain amount of rhetoric given by other
                    countries, but we were the ones who were most actively and strategically
                    engaged. The international community, including the UN institutions, had not yet
                    gotten their act together and there was a lot of talk about who had
                    organizational responsibility. World Health Organization? UN Development
                    Program? A new and specialized office? We have a much more concerted
                    international effort noand, far greater U.S. government resources being
                    committed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, again all of us have changed an awful lot in the
                        years. I think there is much more frankness about sex and all. Was this
                        concern, that we're talking about a sexually transmitted disease, or was
                        that no longer a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, it was a huge problem. Africans, like a lot of Americans, are very
                    conservative and do not talk about these things. People willing to discuss how
                    the disease is spread or prevented are getting into parts of people's lives that
                    are intimate. Also, you cannot talk about HIV and AIDS without getting into the
                    issue of women's empowermenor lack thereof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also, the perception in the United States, and I
                        guess the initial impact was in the gay community, the homosexual community.
                        This sort of tagged the problem. Did you find yourself at this stage that
                        was a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, because in Africa it has always been a heterosexual issue. Also, in
                    Africa even to this day you do not talk about homosexuality. The disease was
                    affecting sex workers, truckers and the middle class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left the African Bureau, was it apparent
                        that people were dying or was it just a problem in potential?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, people were dying, in some countries at higher rates than others.
                    Uganda had a huge rate of AIDS. So did Rwanda and later, South Africa. But we
                    were not seeing the number of infected people, orphans and social impact that
                    you do today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the professionals knew what was happening. What were
                        the tools that we could use at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh my! At that time we were pushing condoms. We were into commodities
                    big time, promoting safe sex. We were also into education. In Central Africa,
                    the most popular condom was called “Prudence.” You can imagine what a wonderful
                    time people had with my name. When I left the African Bureau I had a drawer full
                    of Prudence condoms, Prudence aprons, Prudence t-shirts. These were francophone
                    countries and the tag line in the advertisements was “j'aime avec prudence.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time was the National Security Council, were
                        your people there looking at this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, because this pandemic that was taking place in Rwanda, Burundi,
                    Liberia, Angola and South Africa was not the headline story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other countries or problems or
                        relationships within the government we should talk about do you think there?
                        It was a fascinating time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was a fascinating time and there was a real sense of camaraderie
                    within the Africa Bureau. It was a pleasure to work with people willing to go to
                    very difficult places in order to make a difference. And, oddly enough given
                    some of the problems we were facing, there was a sense of optimism. The mantra
                    was “things are desperate but not hopeless.” Lots of gallows humor. There was a
                    healthy esprit de corps and a management unit that really, really took care of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your manager, your executive secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The Executive Director was Bill Hudson, who is now our Ambassador to
                    Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see all of this working career wise? Were you
                        going to be an African hand or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I fell into it by accident. I didn't know anything about Africa when I
                    joined the Foreign Service but ended up spending 11 years on African issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, we'll now talk about your time in Kenya which was from
                        when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: 1996 to 1999.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this appointment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I had completed three years as Deputy Assistant Secretary in African
                    Affairs and was known to have handled some tough portfolios. I had a good chance
                    at either Kenya or Zambia and at the very last minute I decided to go for
                    Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm surprised that Kenya wasn't more of a political
                        plum. .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You never know what makes a country a political favorite. Tanzania, for
                    example, has fairly consistently gone to political, non-career people. Why high
                    contributing friends of the President would vie for Tanzania is beyond me. For
                    all of its beauty, Kenya was politically tough and held in poor esteem in the
                    USG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about President Moi and his rule and how we viewed
                        it. What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Daniel Arap Moi was Vice President under Kenya's first president, Jomo
                    Kenyatta. When Kenyatta died in office, Moi stepped in and never stepped down.
                    He continued to rule through a coalition of small tribes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he Kikuyu or Masai?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Neither. Kenyatta was Kikuyu. Moi came from the Kalenjin tribe and,
                    with a coalition of other small ethnic groups held power through corruption,
                    force and divisiveness. He also played the U.S. pretty shrewdly during the Cold
                    War. In return for his support, we turned a blind eye to how he ruled
                    domestically. When the Cold War ended, we began to insist on democratic
                    elections.</p>
                <p>In order to “stay at the table,” which is how Kenyans referred to presidential
                    politics, Moi and company held fraudulent elections in '92. We showed our
                    disapproval by withdrawing aid and giving Moi the cold shoulder. By the time I
                    arrived in '96, we were down to about19 million dollars in bilateral assistance
                    directed through non-governmental organizations. Nothing went to the Moi
                    government. Among donor groups, we were pretty small potatoes. The Japanese, the
                    Brits and the Germans were giving much more money than we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a reason why they were giving more or were they
                        getting something for the money they were putting in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I didn't think so. I asked about corruption during my rounds of
                    courtesy calls on other ambassadors and initial meetings with Kenyans. What
                    bothered Kenyans most was the effect of corruption on schooling, which they
                    valued highly and the abominable condition of roads. Stolen road taxes meant
                    greater difficulty getting goods to market. Among diplomatic colleagues, I found
                    huge frustration both with the level of corruption and Moi's reaction should
                    anything be said about. It usually entailed public blasts about interfering in
                    domestic affairs.</p>
                <p>The game was pretty simple: the Moi government would steal assistance money, then
                    insult us if we said anything. People would suffer, the government would go to
                    more donors to get more money which they could steal, etc. I decided to try to
                    change the dynamics by taking on the game. I was lucky that our embassy had a
                    large and experienced Country Team, so there was plenty of experience, support
                    and enthusiasm for confronting corruption.</p>
                <p>When I told my German counterpart of our intentions, he peered down at me and
                    said, “Oh Pru, don't be na�ve!” This was hardly the first time I had been
                    patronized for addressing an issue othermen especiallhad put in the category of
                    “too hard.”</p>
                <p>I began talking about corruption in my speeches, something Kenyan people could
                    not do with impunity. Pretty soon things were showing up in media and more and
                    more people, including my diplomatic colleagues, began to chime in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that ambassador referring to about being naive?
                        In other words, why were they continuing to put money in to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was an attitude I had seen befor“this is Africa; what can you
                    do?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the other countries, or were we getting anything out
                        of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Most of the donors were involved in Kenya for humanitarian and
                    developmental purposes. The U.S. government also wanted continuing military
                    access to Kenyan airports and ports. I suspect Moi had similar quid pro quo
                    agreements with other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pru, this is the 24th of August, 2005. Let's talk a bit
                        about Moi. Did you go in to see him? Was he a person you could see or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Initially, he wouldn't see me. I was the second consecutive woman
                    ambassador, and Moi was not at all pleased to have another female.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Elinor Counselor had been there before that too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Elinor Constable and then Smith Hempstone, who caused an enormous great
                    controversy by going head-to-head with Moi, then Aurelia Brazil and then me. Moi
                    was convinced that the U.S. Government was intentionally sending him women as a
                    message that he was just not good enough to merit a white male. Nor, evidently
                    did he like what he heard about my promotion of human rights. After presenting
                    credentials, I had a hard time getting him to see me. Once I did, we crafted an
                    interesting and rather strange relationship.</p>
                <p>It started when I invited him to the Residence for breakfast one day. That
                    one-on-one started a precedent which led to some very heated discussions.
                    Respectful but blunt.He would fly into tantrums sometimes, or just get mad and
                    cranky. I'd bring him up straight by asking point blank, “Why are you yelling at
                    me?” Once I stopped an argument in mid stream and asked if he enjoyed fighting
                    with me. “Yes,” he responded, “I am a democrat.” I think he rather enjoyed our
                    interchanges. For a time, some members of his cabinet would intercept me before
                    entering a meeting requesting that I bring up a subject to get a decision of
                    their behalf.</p>
                <p>For his part, he delivered on items he knew were important to us. I was on a
                    short fuse for a renewed access agreement to Kenya's ports and airports and he
                    handed it over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, that power had gone to his head? Did he see
                        himself aging gracefully in the job to keep things calm. How did you see him
                        at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: By the time I got there he had been in power for 20-some years, far too
                    long for anybody. He was in his '70s, in good health physically and mentally,
                    still very shrewd and fairly competent. Sometimes he'd ramble, but then don't we
                    all? I think he is corrupt to his soul and had found a way to bring his actions
                    into harmony with his evangelical religion. I think he really believed that he
                    was beloved by his people, clueless that the opposite was true because he
                    surrounded himself with sycophants. Domestically, he was shrewd and ruthless;
                    around the region, Moi behaved as statesman. He used this to his advantage to
                    keep us in his debt. We would ask him to pull together the Somalia warlords, and
                    he would do it. He was sympathetic to our efforts to bring peace to Sudan and,
                    at our request, would talk to his crony, Mobutu, president of Zaire. Like a lot
                    of presidents, Moi wanted to be known in history as the elder statesman and a
                    regional peacemaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again I keep coming back, in my interviews there's a theme
                        that if somebody is going to take an initiative it often seems to be the
                        Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right, which means that as U.S. ambassadors we need to be fairly
                    circumspect. When the Country Team and I decided to take on the issue of
                    corruption, we had to be clever about it. The last thing other diplomats want is
                    direction from the United States ambassador or the United States embassy, which
                    was why in Nairobi we worked through the World Bank director to create an
                    Economic Governance Group of donor countries.</p>
                <p>The Bank was going to provide around one hundred million dollars in an energy
                    sector loan. Given the government's proclivity to steal, to say nothing of their
                    lousy completion ratsomething like three percenmy colleagues in Washington and I
                    decided to do something. I knew the U.S. delegate to the World Bank. With other
                    colleagues, we decided she would vote “no” on the energy loan. That got a lot of
                    attention. Both the World Bank and other governments took notice that we were
                    serious about corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't the Kenyans know that the fine hand of Pru Bushnell
                        was involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Of course, but we were all very polite. The proposal put to the Kenyans
                    was to direct the energy sector loan through a private sector bank that would
                    ensure transparency.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>A social friend of mine arranged a meeting with Moi on a Sunday afternoon at his
                    private residencvery hush-husto discuss this. I was struck by how sterile and
                    lonely the house appeared. He said to me, “If I agree to this it's going to set
                    a precedent, and I'm worried. I said, “You're right, it will and I'd be worried
                    about it too if I were you, because it means doing business differently.” He
                    said, “I don't want to do business differently.” And I said, “Then you're not
                    going to get the money. There you are Mr. President, you need to choose. I know
                    life is unfair and this doesn't seem good and right, but you need to understand
                    our perspective and you have a choice to make. That's what leaders do, they make
                    difficult decisions.” He called me after I got home, about an hour later and
                    said, “I've decided to do it.” And I said, “Good for you Mr. President, you've
                    made the right choice.” I felt like a life coach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you around long enough to see how this worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It worked pretty well at least on that project. Not to say that
                    corruption ended. We came up against other issues, including the International
                    Monetary Fund's readiness to put Kenya on a “shadow program” which would have
                    helped Kenya gain economic credibility they did not deserve. The Economic
                    Governance Group of ambassadors representing donor countries was in agreement to
                    halt assistance until the government improved its efforts to combat corruption,
                    which had been done in the past. This would provoke the Kenyan government to
                    say, “We promise we will not steal again. Now, where's the money?” Some changes
                    would be made, the spigot would be turned back on and the stealing would start
                    again. The experience left me with very strong opinions about reforms required
                    of the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as bilateral assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing anything going beyond the three percent
                        completion of projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. Politicians would open projects with great fan fare, then move on
                    to the next. One of public arguments we made over our decision to suspend
                    assistance was the amount of monehundreds of millions of dollarin the pipeline.
                    We made the point that the government should effectively use what it had
                    first.</p>
                <p>You know, it's very easy to be holier than thou over the issue of corruption in
                    African and other developing countries. But, when you think of it, a lot of
                    these countries, certainly Kenya, were founded in corruption brought by colonial
                    powers that came for the sole purpose of extracting wealth or exploiting the
                    land and its people. They thought nothing of stealing land, enriching
                    themselves, and degrading local communities. Some European powers were worse
                    than others, but all of them showed to one extent or another their so-called
                    civilizing mission meant “we win, you lose.” No wonder emerging African leaders
                    came in with the attitude “it's our turn.” Outsiders need to be careful of the
                    sanctimony.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Another aspect of what we saw as corruption was based on cultural differences and
                    obligations.. Like many Africans, Kenyans have a very strong sense of community,
                    as great as our sense of individualism. Under their custom of “harambe,” an
                    entire community would pool money to send one child to school or university.
                    That's an investment and when one child makes good, that he or she is expected
                    to give a return on the investment, right?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: So, when someone goes into government or gets another kind of job, the
                    community or extended family, has a sense of entitlement. That puts enormous
                    pressure on the individual to share the good fortune.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the benefit is, public job, public funds being
                        directed towards that particular community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right, or money or jobs. It goes on all the time in the States via
                    earmarks and lobbyists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're also breaking some American rice bowls when you cut
                        off money and cut off projects. Did you run across people saying, you know,
                        if you do this I don't have a job anymore, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not on the U.S. side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this wasn't a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No. What was a problem was the moral conundrum of punishing people for
                    having rotten leadership. We talked about this very seriously in the Economic
                    Governments Group — what would the consequences of cutting assistance be on the
                    people. We concluded that the corruption was so bad that it was worth doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, it wasn't delivering that much to the
                        people who should benefit by it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about corruption. What about human rights? What
                        was happening to human rights? Think of women's rights, minority rights.
                        What was happening in that area?</hi>

                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Moi played ethnic groups off against one another, particularly in the
                    Rift Valley which saw periodic killings. On at least one occasion I went there
                    with Jesse Jackson, who was very popular in Kenya. He publicly called for
                    President Moi to visit and call a halt to ethnic clashes. “Where is President
                    Moi? President Moi, where are you and why aren't you here with your people
                    making peace,” Rev. Jackson was quoted as saying. The next day, a disgruntled
                    Moi came to the Residence for breakfast. Jesse had the three of us hold hands as
                    he prayed to the Lord to give guidance and wisdom to his servant, Daniel Arap
                    Moi, to go and make peace in the Rift Valley. What a scene. And it workeMoi went
                    to the Rift Valley a couple of days later.</p>
                <p>Part of what I loved about being ambassador was fostering relationships. From
                    what one reads, you think diplomatic conversations are rather dry. In fact,
                    there is a huge amount of strategy and theatrics involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, one of the human rights concerns or women's
                        rights, particularly in Africa has got very much tied to aids and tribal
                        practices. You know, young virgins who are untainted by aids. I mean, all
                        those things going, was that going through in Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: At the time, the Kenyan government and religious leaders refused to
                    acknowledge the problem of HIV/AIDS. I was active in trying to make it more
                    public. Kenyan society, like many African societies, is very conservative.
                    Talking about sex is taboo.</p>
                <p>I have to say, though, I was even more active about women's rights. Too many
                    young girls were taken out of school at 10 or 11, married off and treated like
                    chattel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this at the tribal level? Was this where the problem
                        was or was it in the city where people were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, it was throughout. There was an acknowledgement that African women
                    did most of the work. The men said, “That's the way it should be.” So, I spent a
                    lot of time talking to women and visiting with women. USAID had a lot of
                    projects that offered the opportunity to talk about women's political rights,
                    girls' education, women's health, and so forth. We used the presidential
                    elections of 1997 to do a lot of training for women.</p>

                <p>The U.S. embassy was instrumental in creating a democracy group through which
                    different embassies pooled their money. It was a kick to see ambassadors from
                    newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union ask to be included. Along
                    with the “usual suspects,” we had Poland, Hungary, Romania...I can't even
                    remember them all. Anyway, we ended up funding of the training of 28,000 Kenyan
                    election observers, many of them women. The staffs from these embassies served
                    as the international election observers. It was a huge endeavor and one in which
                    I was very, very proud, and I'm very sad that it hasn't been done since. That
                    really irks me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, because once you do it too, you will have a
                        cadre.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. What we wanted was local civil participation so that the
                    electorate gets a sense of ownership. It was a sign of maturity that you don't
                    get through watching an outside observers.</p>
                <p>At any rate, in the run-up to the elections, AID was involved in training women
                    trainers to advise others of their rights and to get them to vote. What I found
                    in Kenya, which I never found in Guatemala, was a feistiness and a readiness
                    among many rural women to act once they found out they had certain rights. “You
                    mean it's against the law for my husband to beat me? Where is the policeman??”
                    or, “You mean I can inherit? Where's a lawyer? I found that these were very
                    strong women, and it was wonderful to see them act. It was such a gift to be
                    able to spend time with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they able to make themselves felt while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, yes and no. There were some women political candidates who ran
                    for office. Most of them lost. But, after the elections, they got together, all
                    the women candidates, win or lose, to talk about their experiences, share the
                    best practices and to provide the kind of moral support that they needed to go
                    back to do it again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm thinking and I may even have the wrong country, but
                        recently there have been reports about women visited in Kenya who were not,
                        when their husbands died was not going to get back and thrown back. I mean,
                        they're forming their own little community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, you read that article about the woman who created a women's
                    village.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Evidently up in the northern part of Kenya a woman was rejected by her
                    husband's family or her husband because she had been raped. She was a strong
                    enough person to say, “To hell with you” and went off to live separately and
                    create her own village. More and more women who were abused by their husbands or
                    their families began to join her. Men started up a male village nearby and would
                    come and jeer and give them a hard time, but these women went on with their
                    lives. They created a campground for tourists and also a cultural center. It's
                    been a pretty big success. At the end of the article it said that the men had
                    tried to do the same thing, but it was not a success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The men couldn't do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Couldn't do it, because the women weren't there to do it. Kenyan women
                    from a lot of these ethnic groups are responsible for raising the children,
                    they're responsible for raising the crops, they're responsible for the education
                    of their children and they're responsible for the household. So, what's left? A
                    lot of the women are very self sufficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on the educational side; were you seeing any
                        progress? Were we trying to do anything to improve the educational
                        system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The Kenyans recognized at independence how badly they needed education
                    and they took it seriously. They are very proud of their high literacy rate and
                    infuriated when the government disbanded free primary education and when they
                    saw corruption worm its way into the educational system. The teachers and
                    principals in some places were demanding bribes to show up or to pass a student
                    or to not beat students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Peace Corps in Kenya involved in education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We had lots of Peace Corps Volunteers working on economic development:
                    micro-enterprise work, environment and ecological projects, and small
                    businesses. Gave me great opportunities to travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the Peace Corps as one of the agencies at
                        post, I use to laugh when I'd look at the growth of federal agencies at any
                        embassy. You must have had many.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We had 17, including the Library of Congress, a unit of Walter Reed
                    Hospital, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Departments of Commerce and
                    Agriculture, and all of the usual traditional agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were all basically regional offices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A lot of them were regional, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where they were. Did you find the care and feeding
                        of them a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was difficult in that Nairobi had a very high rate of crime, and
                    staying in touch with the community was important. It was harder to do so when
                    this employee is away for great periods. It can also be very lonely for spouses
                    whose husbands or wives are away from post a lot. They need to make a much
                    greater effort to get the sense of belonging to the community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this play out? When you take people who were
                        coming with no exposure to the overseas experience before, it must have been
                        difficult. How did you work with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Nairobi was known as a low morale post. Supposedly, Nairobi always had
                    low morale. I don't buy it and I put a great deal of stress on community. One of
                    the only requirements I levied on employees was mandatory orientation on
                    arrival, spouses, strongly encouraged. The day would start in my office so that
                    people could get a sense of what an ambassador's office looks like, and I
                    emphasized at that time the importance of community. I reinforced my
                    appreciation for community involvement during courtesy calls. My husband, Dick,
                    and I made sure that we had a strong sponsorship program for new arrivals and we
                    held a number of community activities at the Residence. We also opened the
                    Residence tennis court and swimming pool to the community. The biggest problem
                    was what to do with teens. So, somebody created an American Club to bring people
                    together and give teenagers a place to go.</p>
                <p>It helped that Nairobi had a very good international school, a game park close to
                    the city, lots of good restaurants, shopping centers, things to do and an
                    incredibly beautiful country complete with beaches and mountains. People's
                    experience in Nairobi depended a great deal on where they had served before. AID
                    and State people who had been all over Africa thought this was great. People who
                    had never been to the third world thought it was awful. As ambassador, I
                    considered it my job to do my best to create an environment in which people
                    could be happy. The rest was up to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of volunteer things did you have going there for
                        Americans to get involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We had a very active International Women's Club, an active Community
                    Liaison Office, and lots of interesting opportunities to help locally. There was
                    an animal orphanage, a National Museum and corresponding Friends of the Museum.
                    There was a theater group, there was a Mason group, there were book clubs, there
                    were garden clubs, a huge international diplomatic community and lots of
                    ex-pats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the actual violence? How did one deal with
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We put a huge emphasis on security and had weekly radio checks. Our
                    regional security people went to great lengths to advise people how to stay safe
                    without terrifying them. Nevertheless, we had terrible things happen: a mother
                    and child hijacked at a school bus stop; a school teacher killed in a
                    car-jacking; muggings around the embassy, the whole lot. Unfortunately, you
                    can't keep bad things from happening to people, but you do your best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Mombasa? How did that work out for you? Was this
                        an interesting reporting spot? Or was there not much point in political
                        reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We did a lot of political reporting. Mombasa was the port city with a
                    U.S. Consulate until we closed it in the early 90s. There was an active business
                    community and a huge Muslim population. Also, lots of American missionaries. I
                    made a point of going there every three or four months. Thanks to our Muslim
                    political counselor, we had a strong outreach to Kenyan Muslims, so I had many
                    reasons to visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the tourism business? That must have brought
                        you an awful lot of high rollers from the American scene?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not very many Americans go to Kenya. Many thousands of Europeans go to
                    Kenya, but not very many Americans go. It's too far away. American tourists who
                    did come were usually going on safaris, which were wonderful but very expensive.
                    So, we tended to get the older American who had enough money. They spent a
                    minimum amount of time in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved, speaking of safaris, in protection
                        of animals or was Kenya doing a pretty good job of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Kenya forbade the hunting of wild animals and was a strong party to the
                    treaty that banned the sale of ivory. The U.S. supported their conservation and
                    wildlife efforts with AID funding and Dick and I became good friends with the
                    Director of the Kenya Wildlife Service and his wife. We had many wonderful
                    outings, both official and unofficial.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, the social side, reaching out to the
                        Kenyan society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Kenyans are nice people and, as I said, Nairobi had a large diplomatic
                    community. That said, it is hard for an ambassador to have social friends to
                    whom you divulge what you are really thinking. We had acquaintances. One of the
                    people I was closest to was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs, a woman who had gotten her PhD. at Stanford. She was a Moi insider and
                    as frank as I. Sally and I did a lot of good work together maintaining good
                    relations between our country notwithstanding the attitudes and behaviors that
                    sometimes leaked out from both our governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where it is probably much more than with a man
                        ambassador, I mean there is this sort of getting together of females and
                        figuring out what to do about these peculiar creatures, politicians and all
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: First of all, there are so few women who are in senior-level positions,
                    that we tend to either bond or not at all. I think there is a sense of
                    cooperation, and there certainly was with Sally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political life there? Was there much
                        political life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>There was an enormous amount of political activity. Kenya was known as an island
                    of tranquility in a turbulent region and Nairobi was very livable. So all kinds
                    of people made their way there — Rwandan Tutsis who had fled the genocide in '94
                    and Hutus who came after they lost the war. Somali war loads, Sudanese leaders
                    like John Garang, members of The Lord's Resistance Army from Uganda. Large
                    refugee populations lived on the borders of Sudan and Somalia and some of them
                    made it into Nairobi.</p>
                <p>Plus, I think I mentioned that Moi was involved in a number of regional issues,
                    including Great Lakes, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda. Our embassy
                    provided offices to our Ambassador to Sudan, since we had closed the embassy
                    there. We also did the political analysis for southern Somalia, as well as the
                    reporting about the UN agencies. So, we were very busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, Prudence this is probably a good place to
                        stop. Is there anything we should cover before we cover, come to the rather
                        climatic events of getting yourself blown up?</hi>

                <p>Today is the 30th of August, 2005. Shall we talk now about the security situation
                    as you came as ambassador? We're talking about in the mid 1990s. What sort of
                    directions as ambassador did you get vis a via security and also when you went
                    to Kenya. How did you see the situation?.</p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, remember that in the '90s, President Clinton felt compelled to
                    give the American people their peace dividend, while Congress thought that now
                    that the Cold War was over there was no need for any significant funding of
                    intelligence, foreign affairs or diplomacy. There were discussions about whether
                    we needed embassies not that we had 24-hour news casts, e-mail, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it's done by faxes and e-mail, yeah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. You may remember Newt Gingrich and the Congress closed the
                    federal government a couple of times. Agencies were starved of funding across
                    the board. Needless to say, there was no money for security. Funding provided in
                    the aftermath of the bombing of our embassy in Beirut in the '80that created new
                    building standards for embassies and brought in greater numbers of diplomatic
                    security officerdried up.</p>
                <p>As an answer to lack of funding, State Department stopped talking about need. For
                    example, when we had inadequate staff to fill positions, State eliminated the
                    positions, so we no longer can talk about the need. If there's no money for
                    security, then let's not talk about security needs. The fact of increasing
                    concern at the embassy about crime and violence was irrelevant in Washington. So
                    was the condition of our building.</p>
                <p>The first day I walked into the Chancery I knew something had to be done. Here
                    was an ugly, brown, square box of the concrete located on one of the busiest
                    street corners in Nairobi. We were situated across the street from the train
                    station. Street preachers, homeless children, muggers, hacks and thousands of
                    pedestrians came by our threshold every day. The security offset prescribed by
                    the Inman Report in the aftermath of the truck bombing of our embassy in Beirut
                    in the '80s, was non existent. Three steps from the sidewalk and you were in the
                    embassy. In the back we shared a small parking lot with the Cooperative Bank
                    building which was a 21-story building. We may have had about 20 feet of offset
                    from the rear parking lot, but no more. We had an underground parking lot, which
                    was inadequate, and we were squatting on some space in the front, but that was
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>I had learned before I got to Nairobi that the Foreign Buildings Operation, now
                    Overseas Building Operations, was planning to a $4-7 million renovation of this
                    building that was unsafe and much too small for us. Having spent three years in
                    African Affairs dealing with an assortment of disasters, I thought it was dumb
                    to invest more capital in a building that would never be considered safe. There
                    just was no way to protect the building. I suggested that FBO sell the building
                    and pool the proceeds with the money proposed for the renovations to buy a new
                    site. Washington's response was somewhere between “are you nuts?! and get out of
                    the way, the renovation train has already left the station.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your security office or the apparatus in charge of
                        that back in Washington pay any attention to the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Our security officer, for whom I had a great deal of respect,
                    understood the issue, as did the entire Country Team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, just to get a little feel for this, had any incidents
                        happened, like the Khobar towers, or was that later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The terrorist attack on Khobar Towers had already occurred but
                    terrorism was virtually unknown in Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we're setting the stage. Did Osama Bin Laden or al
                        Qaeda or the Taliban or anything like that cross your radar much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think I mentioned before that Nairobi was a favorite spot for a
                    number of characters and groups. As ambassador I was told there was also an al
                    Qaeda cell in Nairobi and that interested the intel community in Washington. Bin
                    Laden at the time was considered a terrorist financier, not an activist, at
                    least so far as I was told. I had been told in Washington that we wanted to
                    disrupt his activities, which seemed pretty sensible and benign to me. I was not
                    told that a special unit had been established to watch bin Laden's activities,
                    nor that there was a secret indictment against him because of his hand in
                    shooting down the black hawk helicopter. I was aware that a “walk in” had warned
                    us in December 1997 that the embassy may be bombed but I was assured that the
                    guy had done the same thing a number of times to other embassies in Africa and
                    that he was considered “a flake.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, go ahead, you were having these bureaucratic
                        battles.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right, with the Overseas Building Operations. But my energies were
                    focused on Kenya. As I said, we were an active embassy and as Kenya moved toward
                    presidential elections in 1997, the political tension and violence increased.
                    Around the corner from us stood a technical college, and the closer we got to
                    elections in '97, the greater activity. I could stand at my office window and
                    watch students running away from tear-gas hurling police who were being followed
                    by the press. When the tear gas came wafting into our building I would go down
                    to the Consular Section to do a sniff test. Once, I actually had somebody count
                    the number of gas masks.</p>
                <p>My concern was not just employees and visitors. Like most embassies, we had a
                    morale store, cafeteria and medical unit that brought families to us. We became
                    active at issuing warnings about student demonstrations and other reasons to
                    stay out of the area of the chancery.</p>
                <p>In 1997, I was told that we were under what was deemed to be a credible threat
                    from a Somali quasi-humanitarian group called al-Haramain. I was also told that
                    the intel side of the Washington interagency wanted to let things unfold to see
                    where the leads would go. I reported this back to State, along with measures we
                    were taking, but got no response. When I learned that the arms the group was
                    waiting for were allegedly on their way, I asked the Kenyan government to break
                    up the organization. Moi personally assured me they would comply. Some of the
                    members of al-Haramain were deported and life went on.</p>
                <p>Then I got word of a threat from the Lord's Resistance Army, a rebel group in
                    northern Uganda. Again, we advised Washington and again we got nothing back.
                    Meanwhile we continued to do everything we considered reasonable and cautious. I
                    remember that in early 1998 a delegation of counter-terrorist types visited. I
                    met with them in the secure conference room, and when they ended with the
                    pro-forma , “Is there anything we can do for you”? I angrily declared they could
                    answer the god-damn mail. The cursing was intentional because I wanted them to
                    see how frustrated and annoyed I was.</p>
                <p>I also continued to send cables about our vulnerability, which only became more
                    apparent as we dealt with these threats. When I reviewed them before meeting
                    with the Accountability Review Board after the bombing, I was astounded by their
                    frequency.</p>
                <p>General Tony Zinni, Head of Central Command, the military theater under which
                    Kenya fell, understood force protection and agreed with me about the
                    vulnerability of the embassy. With my enthusiastic concurrence he cabled
                    Washington offering one of his own vulnerability assessment teams. That got a
                    reply — not just “no,” but mind your own business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This team that eventually came out was, I take it, a
                        basically a routine thing from Diplomatic Security?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, it was not a routine thing. I think Tony's cable, along with
                    continuing concerns we were voicing, finally provoked a response in the form of
                    an assessment team. Meanwhile, when I returned to Washington on consultations in
                    December of '97, I was told point blank by the AF Executive Office to stop
                    sending cables because people were getting very irritated with me. That really
                    pushed up my blood pressure. Later, in the spring of '98, for the first time in
                    my career I was not asked for input into the “Needs Improvement” section of my
                    performance evaluation. That's always a sign! When I read the criticism that
                    “she tends to overload the bureaucratic circuits,” I knew exactly what it
                    referred to. Yes, the cables had been read, they just weren't appreciated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anything happening at this time from Tanzania from Dar
                        es Salaam? Was there concern there or any of the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, the greatest concern was to our embassy in Uganda, a far more
                    vulnerable building than ours. Dar es Salaam chancery had been built as the
                    Israeli embassy, so it was pretty hefty. Politically, the region was pretty
                    tense. Hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea never diminished entirely.
                    Somalia was chaos. Uganda had rebel forces at work. Eastern CongZaire at the
                    timwas embattled and the entire Great Lakes region, including Rwanda and Burundi
                    was smoldering while the north-south war in Sudan continued. Kenya and Tanzania
                    were looking pretty calm by comparison.</p>
                <p>In May '98, the Director General visited Nairobi, and was exposed to the concerns
                    of the community. While he thought we were on the verge of becoming obsessed
                    over security, offered to take a letter back to Secretary Albright. So, I penned
                    a letter suggesting that, when next defending the State Department budget before
                    Congress, she use our vulnerability as an example of why we needed more security
                    funding. I also wrote to the Undersecretary for Management. I received a highly
                    bureaucratic response from the Undersecretary's officsorry, greater needs
                    elsewhere and no monebut none from the Secretary. That, frankly, didn't surprise
                    me. To my knowledge, no one in the media has seen the letter to the Secretary so
                    why it has been described as “highly emotional” or a “plea” is beyond me.
                    Actually, it's not. Stereotyping is alive and well even if wrong.</p>
                <p>In June, Dick and I took vacation. By this time, renovations, including some
                    security upgrades, were getting started on the chancery.</p>
                <p>When I returned from vacation, among other activities, I continued to participate
                    in the outreach effort to the Kenyan Islamic community initiated by our
                    Political Counselor, who was Muslim. A minority population in Kenya, they felt
                    alienated and marginalized by Moi's government and held a profound distrust of
                    the U.S. I had lots of conversations with these guys, which served us well after
                    the bombing.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>In the years since the bombing, I learned just out just how much I did not know
                    about U.S. national security and law enforcement efforts against al Qaeda. The
                    information was highly compartmentalized, on a “need to know” basis and clearly
                    Washington did not think the US Ambassador needed to know. So, while I was aware
                    of the al Qaeda presence and various U.S. teams coming and going, I did not
                    know, nor was I told, what they were learning. When the Kenyans finally broke up
                    the cell in the spring of '98, I figured “that was that.” Whatever threat may
                    have existeand we never had a sense that there was any threawas removed.</p>
                <p>On Friday, August 7, we started another business day as usual. The DCM was on
                    leave. Our Political Counselor was “acting” DCM and I had asked him to preside
                    over the Friday Country Team meeting. I was finally successful in scheduling a
                    meeting with the Minister of Commerce to talk about an upcoming the U.S. trade
                    delegatioa big deal given how we stiff-armed Kenya —so I was not present. I
                    remember asking that the Country Team discuss how our newcomers were settling in
                    and whether we were reaching the right balance on issues of securitalerting but
                    not paralyzing people to the dangers. In retrospect, that was a very ironic
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>The office of the Minister of Commerce was in the high-rise building across from
                    our small rear parking lot. I walked across with two colleagues from the
                    Department of Commerce, teasing my driver Duncan who was escorting us that he
                    should be holding a little American flag we flew for official government calls.
                    The Minister's office was on the top floor.</p>
                <p>As was the case in many official meetings, the Minister had invited the press to
                    ask questions and take photos before the real talk began. A few minutes after
                    they left, we heard a loud “boom.” I asked, “Is there construction going on”? It
                    sounded like the kind of boom you get when a building is being torn down. The
                    Minister said, “No there isn't.” He and almost everybody else in the room got up
                    to walk to the window. I was the last person up and had taken a few steps when
                    an incredible noise and huge percussion threw me off my feet. I'll never know
                    whether I totally lost consciousness or whether I was semi-conscious, but I was
                    very aware of the shaking of the building. I thought the building was going to
                    collapse, and I was pretty sure I was going to die. At the same time I was
                    calmly thinking “this building is going to fall and I'm going to die,” I was
                    physically steeling myself for a fall. I vaguely remember a shadow, like a white
                    cloud, moving past me and the rattle of the tea cup. Then I looked up. With the
                    exception of a body prone on the other side of the large office, I was the only
                    person left in the room that had held about a dozen people before the explosion
                    occurred. Almost simultaneously, the man I took for dead raised his head, and
                    one of my Commerce colleagues returned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They left you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: My colleague rushed in saying, “Ambassador we've got to get out of
                    here!” I tend to be calm in emergencies and I was probably in shock and maybe
                    denial because I didn't want to leave the floor until we made sure that
                    everybody else was out. We met up with a couple of people including the elevator
                    operator literally ringing his hands saying, “Sorry, I'm so sorry, oh sorry,
                    sorry!” For some reason I thought the building had been bombed because of a
                    nasty banker's strike that was taking place. We were, after all, in the
                    Cooperative Bank Building. So, off we went, down an endless flight of stairs. I
                    have no idea how long it took, literally no idea. At every landing we would have
                    to climb over the steel fire doors that had been blown in. Debris, blood, shoes
                    and pieces of clothing were scattered at every floor.</p>
                <p>What I did not know was that around l0:32, as the Country Team was meeting in my
                    office, a truck with 2,000 pounds of explosives drove into the small rear
                    parking lot I had walked across earlier. The lot was squeezed between the
                    embassy, the Cooperative Bank Building, where my Commerce colleagues and I went
                    to meet with the Minister of Commerce, and a seven story general office
                    building. The truck drew up to the guarded entrance to the underground parking
                    lot of the embassy. One of the two occupants got out and demanded entry. The
                    guard refused and tried to alert the marines via radio. The perpetrator then
                    hurled a stun grenade (the noise we and thousands of other people first heard),
                    then ran. Seconds later, his companion detonated the explosives. The two tons of
                    energy that hit the three buildings surrounding the parking bounced off and over
                    the bricks and mortar with devastating effect. Two hundred thirty people were
                    killed instantaneously. Over 5,000 people were injured, most of them from the
                    chest up and most of them from flying glass. Vehicles and their occupants
                    waiting for the corner traffic light to change to green were incinerated,
                    including all passengers on a city bus.</p>
                <p>The seven story office building next to the embassy collapsed and the rear of our
                    chancery blew off. While the rest of the exterior of our building helit had been
                    constructed to earthquake standardthe windows shattered, the ceilings fell, and
                    most of the interior simply blew up. Forty-six people dieabout a quarter of the
                    occupantwhile others were struck or buried by rubble. All of the cars in the
                    parking lot caught fire, which spread to the top of our generator. On the
                    opposite side of the building, all of the windows blew in. In my office, the
                    Country Team ducked as the windows blew, then crawled downstairs and exited the
                    building along with everyone else who was still able.</p>
                <p>The Acting DCM asked for volunteers to go back in and rescue colleagues, as the
                    medical unit staggered onto the sidewalk and set up triage and medical help. The
                    two front office managers began to record the names of people as cars still fit
                    to drive were flagged down and the injured sent to hospital. Thousands of people
                    were drawn to the scene, many of them crawling over the rubble of the collapsed
                    seven story office building to try to save those who were buried. Some of them
                    climbed into the rear of the embassy to lend help and, some, to loot.</p>

                <p>All this went on while, unaware, my colleague and I descended those endless
                    flights of stairs in the Bank building with hundreds, maybe thousands, of
                    Kenyans pressed together so tightly that I could barely keep my feet on the
                    ground. All I kept thinking was that I just needed to get out of there, to get
                    to the Medical Unit and we would be okay. At one point, the slow parade of
                    people came to a standstill. Some people yelled, “Hurry up, move; there's a
                    fire”! As smoke wafted up the stairwell, I thought for the second time that I
                    was going to die. Again, it was a peaceful though because at least I'd be
                    asphyxiated and not burned to death. Everyone around us remained just as
                    calm.</p>
                <p>When we finally exited the building, I looked across the street to see thousands
                    of people behind a cordon gawking in shock. My colleague exclaimed, “Ambassador,
                    there's press, put your head down!” He took the back of my head and literally
                    pushed it down. Members of the press present at the beginning of the Minister's
                    meeting were still in the area when the bomb was detonated. (Much later a group
                    of Kenyan photographers won the Pulitzer Prize for the bombing photographs, the
                    first time that black Africans had ever won the Pulitzer Prize.)</p>
                <p>Because I was looking down, my first sight of the bomb's impact were shards of
                    glass, twisted steel and, all of a sudden, the charred remains of what was once
                    a human being. That's was caused me to look up. What I saw was fire (hence the
                    smoke in the stairwell), rubble, destruction and the remains of what had been
                    the rear wall of the chancery. A few steps further and we met the Acting DCM
                    coming around the corner. He looked at me very calmly and said, “Hello
                    Ambassador.” I was astounded and very reassured that he seemed so calm. Maybe
                    things were not as bad as they looked. What I didn't know was that, having
                    organized and helped the team that returned to the building to help the buried,
                    dead and wounded, he was now searching for his wife, like us, in shock.</p>
                <p>At almost that same second, others caught sight of me and my colleague. I was
                    grabbed and pushed as someone yelled, “Get her out of here, go, go, move, move,
                    get her out, go, go, go”! I was literally thrown into a private jeep, where we
                    met the second of Commerce colleagues who had been with me in the Minister's
                    office. He looked awful, blood pouring down his face. He kept apologizing for
                    that and for having so swiftly left the office. One of our Foreign Service
                    National security people jumped into the front seat and yelled at the driver to
                    get going. The driver, who worked for one of our political officers, had been
                    walking up the front steps of the Embassy when the bomb was detonated. He had
                    been knocked down, regained consciousness and had gone back to his car to
                    assemble himself when it's bang, bang, “get them out of here, move, move, move,
                    go, go, go!” The fellow stamped on the accelerator and —I will never, ever
                    forget, so vivid is the visiowe careen toward a crowd of people almost crashing
                    into a woman in Somali dress who had just stepped forward. We almost killed her.
                    That was it; time to take charge. I ordered the driver to, “Stop, just stop and
                    go pole, pole slow, slow.”</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Because I thought the hospitals would be overcrowded, I opted to go to a hotel in
                    the hopes it would have a resident doctor. God knows why I thought that. At any
                    rate, we went to the Serena Hotel where my Commerce colleagues were staying. The
                    one colleague was still insisting that I cover my face, but when I looked at the
                    two of them, blood streaming down from head wounds, I decided I couldn't
                    possible look worse. Except for my lip, I did not feel any severe wounds. You
                    can imagine the spectacle we made as we walked into the lobby, punched the
                    elevator button and ascended to one of the rooms. Fortunately, there was a
                    doctor, as well as a nurse at the hotel. One look at my companions and they were
                    whisked off to the hospital. I was deemed fit enough to go to work, provided I
                    have stitches put in my lip that afternoon.</p>
                <p>Adrenalin had kicked in and I was very anxious to get out of there. The embassy
                    radio net made clear the chaos around the embassy and listening to it I began to
                    get a sense of the enormity of what had happened. I used the phone to call Dick,
                    asked him to contact my parents and stay away from the downtown area. It didn't
                    occur to me to break into the radio and it was only when I heard my driver who
                    had been out on an errand and had gone to the British High commission requesting
                    instructions that I spoke. I later found out this was the first time many people
                    realized that I was still alive. I should have gone on earlier to reassure them.
                    Lesson learned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to keep going for a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, let me finish the day. As soon as I could I went over to the AID
                    building, located in a near suburb. The front office managers had already begun
                    to establish a 24-hour operations center and were getting a satellite telephone
                    hooked up when I arrived. The phone system in Nairobi, by this time, had gone
                    dead. We were also in radio contact with colleagues doing rescue work at the
                    embassy. A big part of my job was coordinating orders to the people on site to
                    make sure they had what they needed to muddle through. It was chaos for a long
                    time. Thousands of people were digging bare handed through the rubble of the
                    7-story office building that had collapsed in search of rescuers. The generator
                    behind our building was going full blast with a fire on top of it. The water
                    main in the area had broken, water was flooding the basement of the embassy as
                    electrical lines swung loose. We also had people still buried in rubble.</p>
                <p>At the AID building, I picked up the embassy mission telephone directory and
                    handed it to somebody with instructions to start looking for our people, not
                    stopping until everyone had been accounted for. Teams of Americans and Kenyans
                    went into neighborhoods, hospitals and morgues looking for our folks. No one
                    asked why, no one second guessed, everyone did what was necessardid it
                    heroically and well.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>I had lost total track of time, but at some point early on the Assistant
                    Secretary for African Affairs called. I had barely said hello, when the
                    Secretary of State called on the other line. Both voiced shock about the bombing
                    and about the vulnerability of the building. When I told the Secretary, “Madame
                    Secretary, I wrote you a letter,” there was silence. She had not seen it, she
                    said. I wasn't about to quibble.</p>
                <p>Not much later President Clinton called. When he called me “Pru” I knew someone
                    was passing him cue cards because there's no reason he would know that's what I
                    call myself.” Anyway, he instructed me to secure the perimeter of the chancery.
                    He may have said “I'm sorry,” I don't remember because I was so astounded by the
                    importance of security now that we'd been blown up. This is supposed to be the
                    guy who feels our pain. Once I confirmed that the building next door had
                    collapsed, he ordered me to secure the perimeter there, as well. “But people are
                    still trying to get others out from under the rubble,” I explained. “Oh,” he
                    replied. “Well, then secure the perimeter.” To this day that's the only
                    interaction I ever had with the President about the bombing!</p>
                <p>The information about what had happened and how people were doing came in waves.
                    It got worse and worse as time went on. I mentally kept track of the people I
                    saw or heard from and those I didn't as I learned that there were looters as
                    well as people who wanted to help who got into the embassy from the rubble in
                    the parking lot. I learned that our Marines had been sitting in their van
                    outside the Embassy waiting for one of their colleagues to cash a check when the
                    bomb went off. The one who went in to get the money was killed. Another fell
                    down the elevator shaft but returned with broken ribs from the hospital to help
                    in the rescue. I learned about the janitor who put his life at risk to turn off
                    the generator before the water hit our electrical wires. I learned about acts of
                    incredible courage and terrible deaths. As to security perimeter...that had been
                    taken care of during the first hour. The Marines and a visiting security team
                    donned helmets, flack jackets and guns and grimly kept people away. Kenyans who
                    arrived on the scene to help, or not, were incensed.</p>
                <p>As the day went on, the nightmare grew. Too many dead, too many wounded.
                    Hospitals were flooded with thousands of walking wounded, most bleeding terribly
                    from wounds to chest and face. Many had gone to the window when one of the perps
                    threw the stun grenade and paid a terrible price. At some point I called as many
                    of the Country Team as I could to organize ourselves. Washington, meantime, had
                    set up a task force and questions were coming in faster than we had the
                    information.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>When a semblance of organization took hold I went home to change from the bloody
                    suit and get my lip stitched up at the children's hospital next to the
                    Residence. I returned to our operations' center at AID as soon as I could. Can't
                    remember everything we did but I know I was incredibly grateful for the fact
                    that we had a large mission with lots of willing hands and a senior team that
                    was alive and experienced enough to take over when necessary. I was also
                    thankful for the experience of having handled disasters before so I could
                    provide the kind of instructions that would hopefully help save lives. About ten
                    that night, I left the ops center in the good hands of AID and Embassy officers
                    who could cope and went home exhausted. I was too tired to even wash off the
                    clots of blood stuck in my hair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. One thing before we cut this off. What was the
                        reaction of the Kenyan government and all during this first day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: They were as responsive as they could be. Moi sent out the military,
                    but the military is taught to be warriors. This was not the National Guard or
                    FEMA. They had no idea what to do and became more a part of the problem than the
                    solution. So, they stood down. Moi himself was on the scene within hours to view
                    the damage. The citizens of Nairobi really came together to begin organizing. A
                    real estate developer brought a crane down to start lifting the rubble and
                    thousands were on the scene to help out.</p>
                <p>It was very clear they needed help and it was going to take time for any USG
                    support to arrive. When someone in Washington asked is we could acquiesce to
                    Israeli offers of help, I gratefully concurreprovided they check with the
                    Kenyans, of course. It was a good thing they did come because the planes with
                    the Fairfax County Rescue Squad and the one with State's FEST team both broke
                    down! Both of them. It took over 30 hours before we got any real help from the
                    States. By that time, the Israelis were the heroes and our name was mud.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last thing. Did you learn, I assume at some point you
                        learned about what happened in Dar es Salaam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, almost immediately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern that there might be other bombs or other
                        things happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The news I heard was that an embassy in Dar es Salaam or Kampala or
                    Khartoum was also blown up. There was an awareness that there ware simultaneous
                    explosions. It took awhile for it to come to light that it was our embassy in
                    Dar but it was clear that these had been well planned terrorist attacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern about further attacks??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Not that day but we sure thought about it in Nairobi. State was going
                    to pull out the combat Marines sent to provide perimeter security at the AID
                    building within a couple of months, so they obviously didn't think so. On August
                    7, we were far too busy trying to save lives, tend to the wounded and find the
                    missing to worry about further attacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the media all over you? Were they a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The Kenyan media was already on the scene. The next day the
                    international media arrived in droves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can talk about that next. We'll stop at this point and
                        pick up with the second day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: OK..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 1st of September, 2005. Pru, what happened?
                        The second day you woke up, I assumed washed your hair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The next day, yes, I washed my hair. To be exact, Dick, my husband,
                    washed my hair. Bandages on my fingers, hands and arms from superficial wounds
                    prevented me from putting them in water so Dick did it — one of those moments
                    that would be accompanied by schmaltzy music in the movies.</p>
                <p>It had been a horrible night. The phone in our bedroom kept ringing and when I
                    answered, I'd get silence. I honestly thought that perps were telling me there
                    were more of them out there and they knew I was still alive. We finally got it
                    resolve a few days latea disconnect between the guard house at the front and the
                    one at the gate.</p>
                <p>Downtown people had worked all night to dig survivors out of the collapsed office
                    building. At our operations center, the night shift had been relaying
                    information to the Washington task force (because Nairobi was eight hours ahead
                    we usually interacted during evening and night hours) and keeping tallies our
                    dead, wounded and missing. We had reached forty-something and were still looking
                    for both Kenyans and Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>I needed to see the embassy so went there first. Reinforcements for the marines
                    providing perimeter security had still not arrived but everything was calm. Our
                    Security Engineer had established a lean-to office on the sidewalk and escorted
                    me through the remains of our building. The devastation inside had a deathly
                    stillness to it. I laid roses sent to me by Sally, he Permanent Secretary of the
                    Foreign Ministry on the steps leading into the building because it had now
                    become a sacred place. Duncan, my driver and I then went to the AID
                    building.</p>
                <p>President Moi had convoked the diplomatic corps to State House. Meanwhile, the
                    worst of our injured had been prepped for imminent air evacuation via military
                    plane. Our wonderful Regional Medical Officer suggested I go to the hospital to
                    say good-bye, lest some not make it. I think it was at that point that the
                    advice of a former mentor clicked in: “take care of your people and the rest
                    will take care of itself.” I asked our Econ Counselor to represent me at State
                    House and went over to the hospital. Don Leidel's words became my mantra and
                    leadership philosophy.</p>
                <p>The wounded Kenyans and Americans, were heavily bandaged but putting on as bright
                    a face as they could muster. Even the most seriously wounded gave me a
                    thumbs-up. On the way out of the hospital, I stopped by the room of the Minister
                    of Commerce, the man who had been sitting next to me on the couch and had gone
                    toward the window when we heard the first boom. He had forty stitches in his
                    head. Had I not paused when the bomb exploded, it would have been me.</p>
                <p>The rest of the day was a blur of activity. The medevac plane had landed without
                    supplies or back-up crew and we were informed that the pilot and others required
                    the mandatory 8-hour crew rest before taking our wounded to Germany. My hair
                    caught on fire, as they say. Angry calls to the task force as I went up the DOD
                    chain of command demanding action peppered the other activities.</p>
                <p>The medical officer and I went almost as bezerk when Washington instructed us
                    that we had to put at least some of our wounded on a plane the South African
                    government had sento show good well. We sent the three most stable, all
                    Americans and got thanked by the Kenyan press a few days later with accusations
                    of preferential treatment. Neither of the aircrafts carrying the Fairfax County
                    Rescue Team and the State Department FEST team was going to arrive on time. All
                    in all a lousy day. Thank heaven we had no further deaths.</p>
                <p>The search for our people continued. We put an announcement out on the radio
                    requesting all employees of the American embassy to report in. Meanwhile, family
                    members of the missing were frantically coming in or calling to get news of
                    their loved one. Our human resource people couldn't provide the information
                    others were so desperately seeking, which stoked the stress. Americans, too,
                    were calling the task force in Washington. The ultimate loss was 12 Americans
                    and 32 FSNs but it took us until Sunday afternoon to make that
                    determination.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they? Were they located in any particular
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: They had either been in the rear of the building near the parking lot
                    where the detonation took place, or along the corridors that ended at the back
                    of the building. The energy from the explosion came roaring down the corridors;
                    anyone who happened to be in its path was killed.</p>
                <p>American members of the community had gone to sit with those waiting for news of
                    the whereabouts of loved ones, or reeling from information of the death toll. I
                    visited a couple of them that day. Sue Bartley, spouse of our Consul General,
                    Julian Bartley, was already aware that her son had been killed and was holding
                    out the hope that Julian would be found alive. We were sure that he was not but
                    did not want to stamp out that hope until we found the body. Julian, like other
                    of our African American colleagues, had been mistaken for Kenyan and taken to
                    one of the many over-crowded morgues around the city. It was not until Sunday
                    afternoon that he was found.</p>
                <p>One of our newcomers, Howard Kavaler, having learned that his wife, Prabhi, had
                    been killed, decided to leave post immediately with his two daughters. Howard
                    was amazingly kind to me when we said good-bye.</p>
                <p>That evening the FEST team — I think it stands for Federal Emergency Support Team
                    —and the Fairfax County Search and Rescue Squad finally arrived, along with a
                    host of military personnel, as well as FBI agents. Suddenly, we went from having
                    to manage chaos and tragedy to managing chaos, tragedy AND hundreds of people.
                    The fact that no one came with a specific role or objective made things worse —
                    something I subsequently talked about at length: if you're going to help people
                    in chaotic circumstances you really need to have your act together because, if
                    not you create additional management issues for people already in crisis. The
                    Department at this time had very little experience with the kind of situation
                    Nairobi and Dar were in. We're very good at evacuating people and we're good at
                    taking out our dead. But a terrorist attack that leaves some dead and some not
                    was something we had much less experience with. So, there were inevitable
                    run-ins.</p>
                <p>Our Security Officer, for example, was prohibited from entering the AID building,
                    to which we had transferred operations, because his embassy ID been lost in the
                    attack. One of my most senior people, meanwhile, wanted to resign out of
                    frustration that no one in the new group was listening to him. I pulled everyone
                    into our operations center and laid down the law. I told everyone to “take a
                    good look at me. I am the Chief of Mission. This is my mission and nothing
                    happens unless I say it happens. Here is the Acting DCM. If I'm not here, he's
                    the one who says what's going to happen.” We then organized the visitors so that
                    rather than meeting with all these little groups separately, they would
                    coordinate among themselves, and I would meet with a couple of them every
                    morning or twice a day. Over a period of hours and days things settled down.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Another example of how things became unwittingly complicated was the composition
                    of the FEST teaan interagency group. Our senior Security Officer was brand new;
                    his predecessor, who left only a short time ago, was put on the FEST team. I
                    completely understood the logic of that but it gave me two senior security
                    officers; one who knew Nairobi and had contacts, and another who needed to
                    establish himself. I asked the former RSO to take on liaison with Washington as
                    shadow consultant to the new RSO. If there was any trouble between them they
                    were both gracious and professional enough not to let me know about it, for
                    which I was most grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, we'd talked earlier about Nairobi as being
                        the magnet for every agency in the government, many of which have a very
                        small presence abroad. You know, bad things aren't supposed to happen to
                        bureaucrats who work out of Washington and all of a sudden something happens
                        here. I would imagine you would have the Secretaries of every department
                        wanting to show concern and all. I think it would be a bloody mess. Did you
                        find this coming at you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think that the task force in Washington was dealing with that because
                    I didn't experience much of that. Actually, I think the size of the mission and
                    quality of people allowed us to fare far better than smaller embassies may have.
                    Let me give you an example. One of the agencies was the Medical Research Unit of
                    Walter Reed Hospital, which gave us people with medical backgrounds who were a
                    great boon to us. Also, by the time we were attacked I had been in Nairobi two
                    years and had worked hard to form a community. As I said the other day, it
                    didn't matter what your job description was, people just went to work. We were
                    also very lucky to have two Community Liaison Officers, who were both terrific.
                    The CLOs, along with my husband Dick, were instrumental in working with the
                    community.</p>
                <p>It became really clear that there's no such thing as enough information. I think
                    of New Orleans today. People were just desperate for information. I was not able
                    to go on the radio every time there was an update, so we arranged to have the
                    Marines at Post One who were accustomed to using the radio net to do it. We
                    would write things out for them to read, because it was important that the
                    information be absolutely accurate. Eventually, things settled down.</p>
                <p>The worst three days of the crisis were the first three: Friday, when we were
                    blown up; Saturday when the rescuers finally arrived to create even more chaos;
                    and then Sunday when we held a memorial service for the Americans and dealt with
                    the international news media. Of course they wanted a press conference. I did
                    not want any photographs taken, because I looked pretty banged up but was
                    persuaded otherwise. I smile, because about a week later my OMS came up to me
                    and said, “You know Pru, I really shouldn't be saying this, but I've been seeing
                    pictures of you on television and in the newspaper and I have to say it's good
                    that you got your hair done a few days before we were bombed. As bad as you
                    looked, your hair was okay.”</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>The experience with the international media was a lesson that I hope created
                    systematic change in the way we handle situations like ours. The mission had a
                    small USIS Public Affairs Office that was flooded with press requests from
                    newspapers all over the world. Washington's concern, as always, was the American
                    media; they could not have cared less about the local media. Any ambassador
                    could go on the local media and say pretty much whatever he or she wantnot so
                    with American media. So, instinctively our public affairs people were focused on
                    taking care of the international and American press. They were aware of the
                    Kenyan press and in the press conference they asked, “Does anyone from the
                    Kenyan press have any questions”? But, essentially the international media came
                    in and ran over the local press. That was going to come back to haunt us pretty
                    soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One question. I'm thinking about the American press. Were
                        they picking up on the point of why hadn't something been done? In other
                        words, it was probably common knowledge that you had been complaining.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No it wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: At that point it wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't. So, that didn't come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That did not come up at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because that would have been a very tricky subject to
                        handle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It did come up later. I'll talk about that in a couple of minutes. But
                    at that point, no, that hadn't come up. I had the press conference on Sunday
                    morning. I was also dealing with what was going to happen to the remains of the
                    deceased Americans. I got word that the FBI wanted to come in and do autopsies
                    in Nairobi, which would have taken up to two weeks. I told them, “Under no
                    circumstances.” The people who had lost their loved ones wanted to leave and
                    there was no way I was going to ask them to wait for autopsies. Instead, a plane
                    was sent to return the bodies to the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>I thought we needed to have some farewell and decided to hold a memorial service
                    at the Residence on Sunday afternoon. It was extraordinary to me. Word went out
                    over the embassy radio net. Dick and I usually let the household staff go home
                    on weekends because we enjoyed our privacy and we had completely forgotten to
                    tell them to come in on Sunday. No one was there. I was enlisting my driver,
                    Duncan's support to help when in walks a member of our community. “Can I help?”
                    she asked. “Yes”!</p>
                <p>A few minutes later, a neighbor offered her help and with the hard work of a
                    couple of people, we organized the memorial service that included a pianist and
                    distribution of roses. Our CLO brought a recording of taps. I was desperately
                    searching my brain for memorial services I had attended to come up with a
                    format. I remembered the funeral of a dear friend during which people had gotten
                    up and talked about this person. So, I offered the opportunity to people to get
                    up and talk about our friends and colleagues who had died in the bombing.</p>
                <p>I started it off and soon others were coming up to speak, including the family
                    members of the deceased, which was so poignant and sad. One of the last people
                    to say something was Duncan, my driver. He may have been the only Kenyan there,
                    because the event had been organized so quickly. At any rate, he stood up and
                    said, “I'm a Kenyan by birth, but in my heart today I am an American,” and went
                    on with the dignity and the oratory skill which is so wonderful in Africans. He
                    talked particularly about Julian Bartley, because as CG, Julian had decided that
                    every FSN who wanted a tourist visa to go to the United States deserved to have
                    one, and Duncan was one of the first people who had been given one. That had
                    done so much to make the FSNs feel a trusted part of the United States
                    Government.</p>
                <p>After the service the head of the FEST team, who was the liaison with Washington,
                    met with the family members of the deceased to let them know what would be
                    happening. He told them that the bodies would go through Germany and would be
                    met on Tuesday at Andrews Air Force Base at a ceremony attended by President
                    Clinton. One of the family members protested because he would not have the time
                    to meet his son in college in the South and get to Andrews to attend the
                    ceremony. The response was a kindly “too bad.” I asked the team leader to get
                    back to Washington to see if the ceremony could be delayed by a day so that all
                    family members would get a chance to collect themselves. He did and the problem
                    was fixed. I don't know if you see the trend herI kept pushing back and pushing
                    back on Washington demands, creating a double-edged reputation for myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk for a minute about, the problem of casualties
                        of the Foreign Service Nationals. How many were killed or injured,
                        approximately and what were we able to do about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Thirty-two Kenyan employees were killed. We lost a good part of our
                    motor pool, a good part of the Consular Section, almost all of the shipping
                    section, half of our budget and fiscal section, someone from USIS, and the FSNs
                    in our political and economic sections. The Admin Section was hardest hit, and
                    the horrible reality was that it was also the section on which we relied upon
                    the most to keep things going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As always.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: As always, exactly. It was the Kenyan employees who bore the brunt of
                    bringing out the dead and wounded, finding the missing, renting the refrigerator
                    truck when Nairobi morgues became too full, informing families of the status of
                    loved ones, initiating contacts with the insurance companies, and on top of
                    everything else, tending to the visitors. They barely had time to wipe their
                    tears.</p>
                <p>In Kenyan culture it was an important sign of respect to have the employer
                    present at an employee's funeral. Some of our people were from the hinterlands
                    of Kenya. We sent at least one American to every funeral, no matter where.
                    Having made the decision, I didn't have to do anything furtheI knew it would be
                    taken care of.</p>
                <p>When it came to the injured, Gretchen McCoy, our medical officer, and I insisted
                    that Kenyan and American employees be treated exactly the same. FSNs would be
                    evacuated along with the Americans. And if they needed long-term care, they
                    would get it. Washington agreed, fortunately, and I know that some Kenyans to
                    this day return for medical care.</p>
                <p>That turned out to be one of the easier decisions. One example of the unforeseen
                    complexities dealt with life insurance payments. A number of the FSNs who died
                    were lower-wage employees whose families faced both incredible tragedy and
                    continuing expenses. The local insurance company did a great job in coming up
                    with the money quickly but the problem was who would get it. What about the
                    employee who had two families, one in the village and another in Nairobi. So,
                    who gets the money? Well, it was the person named as beneficiary, the others
                    were out of luck. What about the families who decided that the widow should not
                    inherit and literally took the money from her hands? What could we do about
                    that? For some we helped open bank accounts, for others we could do very little.
                    Problems went on and on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask a question. I'm speaking as somebody who is
                        77 years old, so I belong to a different era. There's something I've seen
                        grow up and that is professional grief counselors. I find this something,
                        almost alien to me. I mean, who in the hell are these people, but it's
                        become part of our culture you might say. Did you have these people? How did
                        you deal with them?</hi>

                <p>BUSHNELL: The US military had sent a number of doctors and counselors to help the
                    Kenyans, because the Kenyan medical establishment was overwhelmed. Some of them
                    did a good job and some did not. Grief counselors were pretty much an anathema
                    to the Kenyan communities.</p>
                <p>The very first person to arrive to help the embassy community was the Regional
                    Psychiatrist from Pretoria. He decided that all employees of the mission should
                    go through debriefings and he used military counselors to help. I think the
                    results were mixed. We decided to do it at the Residence, because we wanted a
                    safe comfortable place, and the Residence was a very pleasant spot. We also
                    decided to have mixed groups of Americans and FSNs. Our motives were good but
                    I'm not at all sure the decision was the right one. I was desperately trying to
                    make good decisionwe all werbut I'm not sure all of them helped as much as we
                    had hoped.</p>
                <p>I did have a separate debriefing for the Country Team because I could not talk as
                    openly with other groups. Plus, some happened to be out of country that day and
                    we wanted to integrate everyone into one team again.</p>
                <p>My husband, Dick, played an important role in getting people to these
                    debriefings. He is one of the most cheerful souls I have ever come across, the
                    kind of man who almost literally wakes up singing, full of energy and
                    enthusiasm. He made sure that all of the FSNs attended the debriefings and made
                    all of the arrangements at the Residence. At one time we had five or six
                    debriefings going on simultaneously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me. Did you find this briefing therapeutic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I found it very useful. In the psychiatric community now there is some
                    controversy as to whether these debriefings are good or not, but I'm glad we did
                    them because I thought the “stiff upper lip” and “move on” tradition of the
                    State Department was completely inappropriate to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the old attitude, I mean get on with it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. So, as a gesture that I cared enough about the people under my
                    leadership to take advantage of this was important to me, and I will stand by
                    that. The concern was that there were some people for whom debriefing may
                    discharge really high emotion and be more negative than positive, and I
                    understand that. I'm still glad I did it and I would do it again tomorrow.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>The briefing went like this. Everybody in the group was asked the question,
                    “Where were you at the time of the bombing”? So, one would simply get the
                    information out. By doing that one was able to see the different perspectives
                    people had from those who were in the building to those who were out of the city
                    or even out of the country. The next question was, “How did you feel then and
                    what are you feeling now?” That's probably the part that could be more
                    controversial. It was for me a critical question to address. I was the only
                    woman on the Country Team and I was the leader. I was so aware of the fact that
                    I had failed in my mission to keep people safe. Even though I had tried, I had
                    failed. It was helpful to share that and to get the full-fledged loyalty of the
                    team. While we never put words to it, it was certainly obvious in retrospect
                    that we would have done anything for one another. I had a senior staff committed
                    to dealing with the incredible challenges in ways that focused on taking care of
                    our people. How much was directly due to the debriefing, I'm not sure but I know
                    it was important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a different attitude toward this from the Kenyan
                        side of things? I mean, Americans are pretty prone to speak out and
                        particularly the newer generation. Not my generation, but a newer generation
                        is able to talk about feelings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Dealing with post-traumatic stress and talking openly about feelings
                    continued to be a big issue in the community for a long time to come. Among the
                    Kenyans, therapy is not a part of the culture. We had counselors available for
                    months, and once the military counselors left we tapped into the local Kenyan
                    counseling community — not just for embassy employees but the Nairobi community
                    at large. A study on the effectiveness of the counseling that was done after I
                    left post found that Kenyans did not take advantage of it, nor did they find it
                    particularly helpful. Far more helpful for them was their church community and
                    their families' support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Americans have been almost trained to accept
                        counseling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Americans maybe, but Foreign Service people, no. After all, if you see
                    a counselor, you have to 'fess up for a security clearance. A lot of American
                    employees feared that getting counseling would jeopardize their careers and so
                    refused to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were hundreds killed who were just not part of our
                        show, the embassy, I mean. They just happened to be there. Did this create
                        any sort of a backlash?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It created an immediate backlash. Within a few days the local press was
                    publishing horrible things, some of them due to decisions I made. A couple of
                    days after the bombing, for example, we got word that Secretary Albright wanted
                    to visit to pay condolences to the Kenyans. I took one look at the Admin
                    Counselor, and I saw that no way were we in any position to host the Secretary.
                    I told her that. She took it very well, though her staff did not. When she came
                    on August 18, eleven days after the bombing, the Kenyans press was very
                    negative.</p>
                <p>Local media and opposition politicians were already making hay over efforts I had
                    made to explain what happened on the day of the bombing. Immediately after the
                    blast, our marines and other security people formed a protective cordon around
                    the embassy. First of all, Kenyans did not understand why in the immediate
                    aftermath we did not rush over to the rubble of the seven-story building to help
                    dig people out. Second, they not understand why we were keeping people from our
                    building. What they saw were armed white men with guns, which they interpreted
                    as indifference at best and hostility at worst.</p>
                <p>The attitude portrayed by the press and some politicians went like this: “We
                    allowed you into our country and in our city and look what happened to us. Just
                    what have you done for us lately? Worse, on the day of the bombing, rather than
                    helping us and showing the spirit of harambe, you point your guns at us, you
                    yell at us to stay out of your building even though we're there to try to help,
                    and you don't do anything to help us.”</p>
                <p>Three or four days after the bombing, I went on local television and radio to
                    explain our side. While the exterior of the chancery building didn't look so
                    bad, at least from the front, the interior was devastated. The building was
                    unsafe and we didn't want people going in and jeopardizing their lives.
                    Furthermore, there were looters who had gotten in whom we had to get out. Saying
                    that just put match to dynamite. The next day, the press and some opposition
                    politicians were ranting “American Ambassador accuses Kenyans of looting.” I
                    learned a big lesson that day: Sometimes telling the whole truth is completely
                    inappropriate. I paid hard for that lesson, I can tell you.</p>
                <p>When Secretary Albright did come I had two conditions: that we not have to
                    prepare briefing papers, because we had lost all of our computers, and we had
                    nothing, nothing. And the other, that she not spend the night, because the
                    security involved in that would have been so astronomical. As it turned out, the
                    plane had problems in Dar, where she had first stopped, and she had to cut her
                    trip short. Rather than meet with the opposition political figures one by one,
                    we invited them to a wreath-laying at the site of the embassy and the building
                    that had collapsed. They were further outraged.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>I, in turn, became almost as angry with them. We had personally supported all of
                    them and funded quite a few. I was so mad at them that I refused to see them
                    until Christmas. I didn't invite them to my house, I cut them off. The Country
                    Team advised me to contact them earlier but I had decided to hell with being
                    ambassador. These politicians were human beings to whom I had paid respect and
                    support who chose to make a spectacle of circumstances for no reason but
                    political show. Others at the embassy continued meetings but I didn't until
                    December when we finally reconciled with all but one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think, you know, political posturing, at certain
                        times this is not appropriate. I mean, it's disgusting in any culture. I
                        think people should be called on this. What about the Kenyan reaction to al
                        Qaeda and Islam? Did they get nasty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The majority of Kenyans are Christian. The Muslim community, mostly
                    concentrated on the coast and Somali border, had already felt marginalized,
                    which frankly they were. Feelings didn't get better after the bombing,
                    especially when, within 48 hours of the bombing, 250 FBI agents arrived. I had
                    some tough negotiation about whether they would come with guns. Fortunately, the
                    Special Agent in Charge, a woman, was terrific and we settled on short guns and
                    soft clothes, i.e. regular suits and discrete weaponry. The Canadians gave the
                    FBI a place from which to work. To understand the trail they were following I
                    need to take you back to the moment of the bombing. Two guys in a truck with
                    2,000 pounds of explosives planned to enter the underground parking lot of the
                    embassy. Our security guard said no. One of the men got out of the vehicle to
                    argue, threw a stun grenade, panicked and ran away. The guy left in the truck
                    detonated the bomb.</p>
                <p>The perpetrator who ran away first returned to his hotel. Because he was injured,
                    he then checked himself into a hospital. In his pants pockets were the plans for
                    the bombing. The hotel clerk thought this guy was suspicious coming back in such
                    bad condition and then leaving to go to the hospital, so he alerted the police.
                    The police went to the hospital, found the guy and found the plans. So, there
                    was suspect number one.</p>
                <p>The FBI sifted through the rubble and pieced together the make of the vehicle,
                    which was a key lead that soon led them right into the Muslim community. Of
                    course they were working with the Kenyan police, so it was the Kenyans who were
                    knocking on doors, but nobody was particularly fooled. Everybody knew that the
                    Kenyans were serving as the surrogates, if you will, and even if they weren't
                    they had a lousy reputation. So, not surprisingly, rumors started about how
                    people brought in for questioning were being treated, etc. I was deeply
                    concerned both because the rumors weren't true and because I was now, in
                    addition to everything else, trying to recoup the friendship of the Kenyan
                    people. The last thing I needed was to deal with lies about how people were
                    being treated by the police and FBI.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>I was also concerned about the security of the FBI. If members of the Muslim
                    community really got up in arms, so to speak, it would add another layer of
                    danger. A couple of times I met with the leaders of the Muslim community with
                    whom I had fortunately created a link long before we were bombed. I was able to
                    bring them together with the Special Agent-in-Chargwho, by the way, changed
                    every 90 dayto say “Would you please exchange telephone numbers so you can talk
                    with one another, clarify rumors and help one another.” For a while it would
                    work, then rumors and charges would begin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The perpetrators of the bombing in Kenya, were they
                        indigenous or recruited or had they been Saudis or Pakistanis or somebody
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: None came from Kenya. Egypt, Comoros, Yemen I think, but not Kenya. I
                    learned that when the Government of Kenya took down the al Qaeda cell in the
                    spring of '98, we all falsely concluded that al Qaeda no longer had a footprint
                    in Nairobi or in Kenya. Actually, they had simply gone underground. I also
                    learned that there were a number of U.S. embassies under surveillance. Nairobi
                    and Dar looked easy; plus, there was a female ambassador in Nairobi, and they
                    thought they would get more play if they killed a woman ambassador. I was
                    shocked when I learned that at the trial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's get back to the recovery. You mentioned that
                        after the remains of the American dead were sent back to Washington you
                        entered a new phase.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Things shifted. The worst of our wounded were in safe hands, the
                    initial chaos was over as we could focus on the extent of our losses and what we
                    needed to do. Dealing with the anger of the Kenyans was one thing; paying
                    respect to the members of our FSN community was another. We held a memorial
                    service in the garden of the Residence before the end of the first week for the
                    Kenyan colleagues we had lost. We were a large mission so I spent a long time
                    greeting people. I could immediately see those who had lost a loved one. I'll
                    never forget the haunted, shocked, sorrowful expressions on their faces. Then,
                    as I said before, there were individual funerals to attend and additional
                    memorial services for individual Americans.</p>
                <p>We also had to manage Washington, because once the press left and the crisis task
                    force disbanded, we lost a cohesive way of dealing with the myriad of issues we
                    faced. The Africa Bureau was as usual flooded with problems all over the sub
                    Sahara and we were just one of many problems. The Department returned to
                    business as usual much faster than we were ready and we felt that there was a
                    lack of understanding as to just how blown away we literally had been. People
                    would start saying, “Well, you didn't respond to our cable, what's wrong with
                    you”? “Well, our communication system had been blown up.” For a while I was
                    interacting with the Department via Hotmaiwe were lucky that AID had an internet
                    link.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. And via cell phone. We had nothing else. Our people literally
                    had to dig through the rubble of the embassy and move as much as could be
                    salvaged over to the AID building, where we were squeezed in. OSHA would have
                    had a fit if they had seen us. Your office here would probably have had six
                    people in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about an office about 25 feet by 10?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We were cheek to jowl with wires all over the place. The AID building
                    was in the suburbs of Nairobi. It had been built as an apartment building, but
                    by Kenyan standards. It was so vulnerable that on the eighth floor where my
                    office was we were allowed only one safe and that was put next to a pillar for
                    fear it would otherwise fall through the floor. The AID Director had arrived
                    just a few days before the bombing. He offered to give up his office but I
                    thought that we would be in there temporarily, so I said, “No, no, no, I'll just
                    take this little side office.” It ended up being my office the rest of the time
                    I was in Nairobi. It was a tiny little office. There were times when I wished
                    that Jock had offered his office a second time, but he didn't. On the other
                    hand, it showed people that I was in it with them, that I did not have any more
                    perks than they did. Fortunately, the AID office building was not too far away
                    from the Residence, so I could have many meetings there. It turned out not to be
                    a big deal.</p>
                <p>As you can imagine, we were hemorrhaging money. We were getting to the end of the
                    fiscal year and rather that scrubbing the books we were writing checks. The
                    Department kept saying, “It's okay, eventually we'll cover them” but our new
                    financial management officer was terrified that he was going to be in violation
                    of the Anti-Deficiency Act. The communications people fashioned a section out of
                    the floor I was on and began to cannibalize the computers that had been blown
                    up. Everything seemed to take so long to get fixed. I won't even talk about
                    personal issues, like trying to get insurance to pay for vehicles or belongings
                    that were lost. Being bombed didn't fit the guidelines for anything. Eventually,
                    the Department created the Office of Victims Assistance to help in cases like
                    ours but it didn't exist at the time.</p>
                <p>Once the Secretary and her entourage came and left, we received what I began to
                    call the disaster tourists. Well meaning people from various parts of Washington
                    who couldn't do a thing to help us. In November I sent a cable to Washington
                    requesting by name the people we wanted to visit. The response was “Now wait a
                    minute, you're complaining about the visitors who are coming and now you want
                    others. You're sending very mixed messages here.” They didn't seem to understand
                    the difference between those VIPs who could be part of the solution and those
                    having their photographs taken in the remains of the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>Among the visitors were two Congressional staffers from the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee which, at the time, was chaired by Jesse Helmnot exactly
                    someone enamored of the Foreign Service. I had them meet with school teachers
                    and community members because I wanted the staffers to understand the ripple
                    effects of the bombing on the entire community. They heard the concerns and
                    complaints of the community and took those back to Washington. I got into big
                    trouble!</p>
                <p>A colleague from Washington, and someone I had known for years, let me have it on
                    behalf of the “Seventh Floor.” He told me I had gone too far and that some folks
                    back in Washington thought I had lost it entirely. He ended by saying that we
                    were going to get what we wanted—attention from the Director General—but that he
                    (DG) was coming to shake his fist in my face. I thought I was going to melt
                    away. It took every bit of resilience I had to keep control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you respond to all of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I was dumbfounded. I hadn't been so upset since the week of the bombing
                    when I was ambushed on camera by CNN with a question about the letter I had sent
                    to the Secretary regarding security concerns. Someone had leaked the information
                    and the Department had not yet figured out how it would respond. They were
                    shocked and most upset when they called me and found out I had already been
                    asked about ias if I were the person responsible for the leak.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the fact is that the Director General did come, listened and committed
                    himself to run interference back in the Department when we needed it.</p>
                <p>We desperately needed volunteers to help us get back up and running and people
                    responded in best Foreign Service fashion. As an example, a FSN came from London
                    to do nothing but write job descriptions for six weeks. We couldn't advertise
                    the jobs of the people we had lost because all of our job descriptions had gone
                    up in smoke. Without advertising the jobs, we couldn't hire, train or replace.
                    This was typical of kinds of things we had to do to get as far as Square One.
                    Another example of the invaluable help some people provided was the
                    re-establishment of our Post Office.</p>
                <p>I don't want to give the impression that we had received no help from Washington.
                    On the contrary. Some of our colleagues were extraordinary. For example, there
                    was a TDY team in town to review the status of our Army Post Office, given the
                    few number of military personnel at post. They were likely going to close it
                    down. The bombing, of course, made it a moot point. But rather than just leave,
                    these people took it upon themselves to set up a new APO in the AID building
                    where we had moved. I'm not sure anyone told them to do it. They just did. I
                    can't tell you what a morale booster that was! Within ten days we were getting
                    mail.</p>
                <p>People volunteered from posts all over the world to come help. It was
                    amazing.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was what you needed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: By contrast, a few weeks after the bombing I was told that the combat
                    marines sent to provide the security perimeter lacking at the AID building would
                    be removed for lack of funds. That conversation and my threat to call a press
                    conference should the decision be implemented continued for months. The
                    rationale in Washington was that, having been blown up, we would not be harmed
                    again. We felt quite differently where we were.</p>
                <p>We had already experienced the results of an intercepted package at the AID
                    building. The sniffer dogs behaved as they do when coming across bombs and we
                    all had file down into the basement of the building to wait the results of the
                    investigation. It turned out to be an innocent package but the experience shook
                    people to the core. The looks on their faces told me just how much we were still
                    dealing with bomb effects.</p>
                <p>Another security test came as a result of President Clinton's order to bomb the
                    al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and a chemical factory in Sudan. Louie Freeh, the
                    Director the FBI, had arrived that day and he and I were to meet the following
                    morning. That night, however, I received an urgent telephone call advising me
                    the Director was coming over to see me immediately. I got out of bed, threw on
                    some clothes on and called one of the Country Team members who lived nearby to
                    hasten over. This sounded serious.</p>
                <p>When Freeh arrived he was beside himself. He had just learned that the U.S. was
                    going to launch missile attacks and no one had given him prior warning. He
                    wanted to know what I knewhich was less than he, at that poinand what my plan
                    was. “I assume,” he said “that you're going to evacuate. I'm removing all FBI
                    personnel; I have five seats left on the plane coming in that I'll give to you.
                    You can decide whom you want to send out.” Then, he dashed off.</p>
                <p>Huh?? I called Washington to verify the newAF was as much in the dark as wthen
                    had our security team come over to the Residence. We looked at one another with
                    both shock and bemusement, then settled down to figure out the worse reaction we
                    could think of. Given the anger Kenyans were feeling toward al Qaeda, and the
                    small number of Muslims in Nairobi, about the worse we would experience was the
                    ire of people coming back from Friday prayers at a Mosque some distance away
                    from AOD. We decided to close the embassy at noon, advise people to stay home
                    and see what happened. Nothing. Meanwhile, the FBI with all of their long-guns,
                    short-guns and soft suits had high-tailed it out.</p>
                <p>Yet another security ordeal came just before Christmas when we received credible
                    warnings from Washington of another possible attack on a U.S. embassy facility,
                    along with a local threat against the International School in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an American school, not your school
                        specifically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was the International School of Kenya, the school that the U.S.
                    Government supported. We decided to cancel all Christmas festivities, close the
                    embassy, and arranged to have the Christmas packages and mail delivered to an
                    offsite location. I didn't know how much worse things could get. Fortunately,
                    they began to look up in the new year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. We will pick this up from New Year's on when we
                        move in to the real recovery phase.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Question, and you can answer it at another time. Given
                        your prior complaints about embassy security, did you have a feeling that
                        your record would be negatively affected or not, or do ambassadors get that
                        sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was much more subtle. I had the feeling that I was deemed
                    untrustworthy by senior people, especially after my efforts to get attention to
                    the post after the bombing. The Accountability Review Board came to Nairobi with
                    the full intention of holding me accountable. Members felt differently after
                    they heard our views and concluded, among other things, that a succession of
                    Administrations and Congresses, including the current one, did not pay
                    sufficient attention to security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a bad thing to happen to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: In some respects. On the one hand, I became a pioneer among ambassadors
                    who started pushing back because of their security responsibilities. On the
                    other hand, to some of my colleagues and political appointees, I would forever
                    be a person who didn't stay in the box.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're going to have to continue this, but I've heard
                        people who dealt with the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright at that
                        time, she was surrounded by a group of people for the most part who were
                        very protective of her and you know, almost vengeful on anybody who might
                        hurt her reputation. Did you feel that at all or at least did you feel that
                        there was a cocoon around her?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very much so. I know they were very mad at me for not allowing the
                    Secretary to visit in the immediate aftermath of the bombing — they made that
                    very clear to me. But, I really didn't see them as that vengeful. I had traveled
                    with Madeleine Albright and her team when she was at USUN. So, I knew a couple
                    of the people and we had gotten along all right. That said, there was no doubt
                    in my mind as to where their loyalties lay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well then, we'll pick this up the next time after
                        New Year's, it will be '99?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we'll pick it up then and the new phase.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 8th of September, 2005. Pru, you mentioned before that really up to
                    the end of 1998 it was really an initial recovery phase. Now, we're talking
                    about 1999. When did you put it together and back to being a diplomat again?</p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We didn't waste much time getting back to work. When I look at my
                    calendar at the time I can see that I was juggling all sorts of
                    things...memorial services with meetings on the economy; reconstruction issues
                    with political issues, starting by repairing our relationship with Kenyans.</p>
                <p>If I had to pick a point representing a new chapter it would be New Year's Eve,
                    1998. A longstanding embassy tradition was the sun-downer at Nairobi Game Park.
                    Families would gather and watch the sunset over the park before going off to
                    other New Year celebrations. It was terribly important that we reinitiate our
                    traditions, and certainly the New Year's Eve sundowner was one of the wonderful
                    ones.</p>
                <p>A lot of people went out. All of us felt the presence of ghosts, people who had
                    been there the year before who were no longer with us. Given the tension around
                    Christmas when threats forced us to close the embassy and cancel holiday
                    activities, emotions were high. Here we were, in this extraordinary landscape of
                    savannah and acacia trees, near the Ngong Hills looking at a rhino in the
                    distance. The sun began to set as someone played Auld Lang Sine. We hugged one
                    another, many of us with tears in our eyes. We had survived but so many of our
                    friends, colleagues and neighbors had not. Then I looked up and saw one of the
                    most extraordinary sunsets of my life. Bright shafts of light and blue skies
                    appeared between two thin layers of pink clouds. It was such a message of
                    comfort. The sun does come up and go down, no matter what happens to
                    individuals. It was a fitting enor beginning.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>The Consular Section was the first part of the embassy to be re-opened at a brand
                    new site. Which reminds me of an amazing story. At some point after the bombing
                    I ran into an American citizen in Washington who came up to me and said, “Are
                    you the ambassador from Nairobi?” “Yes I am.” He said, “Let me tell you
                    something. My wife was in Nairobi as a tourist on the day of the bombing. Her
                    passport had been stolen along with a number of other things. She was on her way
                    down to the embassy to apply for a new passport when the bomb went off. When she
                    arrived at the embassy a number of hours after the bombing, she met up with an
                    American Foreign Service Officer, going through the rubble. My wife explained
                    her problem and was issued a new passport.” Isn't that an incredible? Our
                    consular operations in some respects were never down, although we lacked the
                    facilities.</p>
                <p>FBO purchased and renovated a house for consular operations. They also found a
                    building to which we could move pending the construction of a new embassy — the
                    AID was clearly unacceptable.</p>
                <p>Mending our relations with the Kenyans was also a priority of reconstruction
                    efforts. In early '99 we finally received Congressional funding — $40 million —
                    to assist with the enormous costs the Kenyans had borne. We were not, however,
                    to spend a penny for overhead costs, which meant that in addition to everything
                    else, we had to figure out how to dispense funds fairly and accountably. The AID
                    staff did a wonderful job. We were able to cover medical costs, reconstruct some
                    of the buildings and establish a limited scholarship fund for orphans.
                    Unfortunately, the needs far outweighed the funds and a lot of Kenyans remain
                    angry with us to this day for lack of compensation.</p>
                <p>I became the human face of the USof course, I always was. I spent a good amount
                    of time visiting hospitals and orphanages, going to various kinds of
                    commemorative events and talking with people. It was heart-wrenching work and
                    very important.</p>
                <p>We also got back into policy issues. I already talked about what we were doing on
                    the corruption front. Moi had won another term in the '97 elections; opposition
                    parties were arguing for constitutional changes and power sharing; regional
                    conflicts continued and our agenda remained as full as ever. In addition, we
                    began working on joint and then regional military exercises. Easier said than
                    done because Tanzania and Uganda were in the European Theater Command and Kenya
                    was in the Central Command. Still, we were able to initiate disaster assistance
                    exercises, which proved a wonderful precedent.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>But, we could not ignore community issues and the impact of the bombing on the
                    staff, families, teachers and thousands of Kenyans. As I've already said,
                    counseling was not a part of Kenyan culture, nor the Foreign Service culture, so
                    while we offered it, few took advantage. People were all over the place in their
                    reactions to the trauma. Some moved on very quickly and others could not. The
                    embassy community was divided. I called in as much help as I could gefrom State
                    psychiatrists to an expert from Oklahoma City to FSI trainers. I learned a lot
                    from them but as a community member and leader, I can tell you that we had lots
                    of ups and downs.</p>
                <p>I learned that I could not make people heal. I couldn't take away people's anger
                    or sadness or denial or anything that they were going through. What I could do
                    was to create an environment in which they could help themselves to heal. I
                    could create an environment in which people cared for one another. “Take care of
                    yourself; be kind to yourself, and be kind to one another” became a mantra and a
                    leadership philosophy. I was determined that we were going to get through this
                    as a community even if as individuals we staggered and stumbled now and
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did, you get this out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Town hall meetings, staff meetings, newsletters, memos...all of the
                    usual communication vehicles. Plus, we had memorials. Absent a location to
                    commemorate the 44 people who had died in the embassy, I set aside a part of the
                    Residence gardens to create a fountain, the lip of which had the names of all of
                    our deceased. It was personally healing. I had hoped to use the commemoration as
                    part remembrance, part celebration of the many acts of heroism displayed since
                    the bomb was detonated.</p>
                <p>Washington had given us a general Mission Award for Heroism but that was it. It
                    was up to us to take care of whatever individual or other group awards we wanted
                    to give. I asked one of the political officers, poor guy, to do nothing but talk
                    to people and write up awards. Another lesson learned. It was absolutely the
                    wrong thing to do and turned into a mess. The process opened all sorts of
                    wounds, anger and finger-pointing; it pulled people apart rather than bringing
                    them together. So, we focused on commemorating the memorial fountain that day
                    rather than the awards.</p>
                <p>The Assistant Secretary for African Affairs came and, to our surprise, so did
                    many of the family members of the Americans who had been killed. Unlike the
                    family members of our deceased Kenyan colleagues, the Americans were very open
                    in their anger — at the way they had been treated by the Department, at the fact
                    that their loved ones had died, at the tragedy imposed so suddenly. It was so
                    painful to witness and even more so, to absorb during a tense meeting after the
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I assume that your husband played resident
                        physiatrist when you came home?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: He took wonderful care of me and of others. He had served as CLO years
                    before and had always remained active in the community, even more so after the
                    bombing.</p>
                <p>I also had to help myself — focus on first things first and one thing at a time
                    and avoid becoming overwhelmed at the totality of our problems. I started the
                    day swimming laps, did exercises, meditated — whatever I could do to keep body
                    and soul together. Since I knew I was going to Guatemala, I also began studying
                    Spanish, first on my own, then with a tutor. It helped a lot to concentrate on
                    something that had nothing to do with the bombing. Before I knew it, May had
                    come around and it was time to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question I want to ask. The immediate aftermath of the
                        bombing, did you have a feeling that anybody in Washington was saying,
                        “Maybe we better get her out of there.” You know, I mean I can see people
                        saying, “Well, maybe we better send a man in or an ex-soldier in” or
                        something like that. Was this ever a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: If there were such conversations in Washington, they never came to my
                    ear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you're a powerful person and talking to you I would
                        think it would be ridiculous. But, knowing Washington and people sitting
                        around there....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The Assistant Secretary for African Affairs was a woman and so was the
                    Secretary of State. These were formidable women who knew me before the bombing.
                    I think I would have had to have gone pretty far astray. People got frustrated
                    with me and people got angry with me, but I don't know that they ever thought
                    that I was not up for the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware or hear of happenings in Dar es
                        Salaam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I actually had very little contact with Dar es Salaam. In part, because
                    it took us a few months to get our communication systems up and running. I knew
                    John Lang who was the Charg� in Dar at the time of the bombing. He and I
                    communicated I suspect through Hotmail on a couple of personnel issues. The new
                    ambassador arrived, a political appointee whom I did not know. Dar was somewhat
                    different in that it did not have the extensive loss of life that we had. I was
                    aware that they were reconstructing as well, but I can't say that we had that
                    much interaction. Up until the moment I left, there was so much to do in
                    Nairobi.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>FSNs, in particular, were concerned about the transfer cycle and how their new
                    bosses would interact with them. Would they understand the extent of the damage
                    and trauma? Johnnie Carson, who had been DAS in African Affairs, was to replace
                    me which was great news, but many of the others were unknown. On the Washington
                    end, MED held briefings to alert people as to what to expect. In Nairobi, the
                    DCwho, fortunately was stayinand I met in small groups with all of the FSNs to
                    give them whatever information we had about the building to which they would be
                    moved pending the construction of a new embassy, and to listen to their
                    concerns.</p>
                <p>One, which had come up earlier, was the disposition of the old chancery and
                    grounds. Fortunately, it was too damaged to every use again, so we pulled it
                    down. (Among the myriad of decisions was whether to blast it down or chip it
                    down. I decided that Nairobi residents did not need to hear another blast from
                    that spot, so opted for chipping. Oh, the complaints!).</p>
                <p>The grounds had been leased to us by the Kenyan government for 99 years and we
                    still had lots of time left. People voiced concern that if we returned the land,
                    one of the land-grabbing members of Moi's cabinet would seize it to construct
                    heaven knows what.</p>
                <p>I went back to FBO requesting that we construct a memorial park and began another
                    round of mutually irritating conversations. “We don't do memorials!” My
                    instructions were precise: hand it back. We did, but not before I cornered every
                    senior member of Moi's government with the request that he support the
                    establishment of a memorial park. The local American business organization had
                    offered to landscape it and provide money for upkeep. I took a cue from the
                    Vietnam Memorial in Washington and asked that a wall be constructed with the
                    names of everyone who had died in the attack so that their children and
                    grandchildren could come and remember them. By the time I left plans were well
                    along and the park remains there today, although I understand it is short of
                    funding.</p>
                <p>I did my best to implement a good exit strategy and noticed that people were
                    taking our departure fairly easily. At first I thought this was great. Then self
                    satisfaction turned to irritation and then hurt. After all we had gone through,
                    no one was going to organize even a standard good-by ceremony? The day before
                    our departure, Dick and I had inevitable errands which included stopping by the
                    DCM's Residence. We pulled into the driveway and there, lining each side were
                    all of the mission employees. They had worked up a surprise party for me! I was
                    shocked. It was one of the most memorable points of my life, because the message
                    was, “Hey, Ambassador, you who have prided yourself on having such a good pulse
                    on your community didn't know what we were doing. We put one over on you. We did
                    this as a community. It's okay, you can go.” It was just such an incredible
                    message. If it were a movie, you would have had schmaltzy music and garish sun
                    sets.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Moi and I had our final tiff at the formal going-away ceremony. He was mad, I
                    learned later, that Washington was not sending a white male to replace me and
                    decided it was my fault. Fortunately, he did confirm that we could use the land
                    for a park, so we got what we wanted in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get any feedback about how Carson and Moi got
                        along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, they got along very well. Three years later, when I returned for
                    the commemoration of the memorial park and Moi was as nice to me as could be. He
                    just happened to be grumpy when I took my leave as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, it wasn't a time to get grumpy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, like many despots, it was always about him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you left Kenya you knew you were going to
                        Guatemala. How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: When Secretary Albright visited Kenya after the bombing, she asked
                    about my next assignment. My husband, Dick, and Linda Howard, who had been my
                    OMS for years, had already decided they wanted Guatemala. So, when the Secretary
                    asked where I wanted to go, Guatemala was what came out of my mouth. It was a
                    complete accident. She thought I'd be good in Guatemala, so that was it. WHA,
                    the Western Hemisphere Affairs bureau, was less than thrilled to have an
                    interloper come into their turf and let me know that in no uncertain terms. I
                    was told they already had their “minority candidate.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were considered a minority candidate still at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yep, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We left Nairobi in May, 1999 and I had my confirmation hearing within
                    two or three weeks of our departure. I then went into Spanish language
                    training.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than the flak you got from WHA on Guatemala, did you
                        feel stigmatized? I obviously go back a long way. Ambassadors and people who
                        had been kidnapped were really stigmatized, people would avoid them in the
                        corridors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: With some people, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think after Diego Asencio and Columbia, they made an
                        extra effort to try and break this thing, but it was still there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A couple of terrorist experts I talked to and before 2001 there weren't
                    very manexplained to me that it is quite normal fort victims to be stigmatized.
                    Blaming the victim is not a new phenomenon. It was very subtle, however.</p>
                <p>That summer was very difficult. I had spent so much time in Nairobi in the
                    aftermath of the bombing focused on my leadership responsibilities that I did
                    not fully appreciate how hurt I was — not physically hurt, but how wounded I
                    was. I never had the chance to be a victim. When I came back to the U.S. the
                    world became surreal. I sensed that somehow I was not behaving the way a proper
                    victim shoulwhatever than meant.</p>
                <p>I also had yet another run-in before the first anniversary commemoration. I was
                    told that the grand invitation-only event to be held in the Benjamin Franklin
                    Room was in part a response to family members of the Americans who were killed,
                    some of whom remained very angry at the way they were treated by the Department.
                    In other words, it was a rather forced event. Space was obviously limited and I
                    kept submitting names of people from Nairobi who had not been invited. I was
                    told that I was ruining the seating chart and hit the ceiling. Then, of course,
                    I was told I was over-reacting. So, the tension continued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also too, something that will haunt you for the rest
                        of your life. You're the person whose embassy was blown up. I mean, when I
                        first heard about you that's what I got.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, they certainly had my number. During courtesy calls to the Hill
                    before my confirmation hearing I was specifically told that I was not to talk
                    about anything that did not deal with Guatemala. Nevertheless, I mentioned my
                    concerns for security because the Department still did not ask for or receive
                    fund adequate to address the problems embassies had around the world. Got into
                    big trouble. In those days, you had to have someone from H accompany you. I was
                    with a political appointee seeing a powerful Senate staffer, and began to talk
                    about security. The baby-sitter interrupted and said, “Ambassador, you're not
                    allowed to talk about that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>When we left the staffer's office I reminded him that this was the United States
                    and as an American citizen I could say whatever I damn well wanted. Later that
                    summer I ended up in the Department's medical unit with a terrible, terrible
                    earache. The doctor who saw me said it was TMJ and asked if I was clenching my
                    jaw a lot. I'll say. Anyway, after about six weeks of one-on-one Spanish at FSI,
                    I got my 3/3 rating, and headed to Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, how did you find you were treated by
                        Western Hemisphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Very nicely, very courteously. They helped prepare me very well, though
                    I have to say I was shocked to learn during the last days of consultations that
                    I would have 24-hour security guards, because one of our ambassadors had been
                    assassinated in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Gordon Mein.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was killed in August 28, 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You have a good memory. Thirty years later, Guatemala was still a
                    violent country and bodyguards were not unusual among the elites and diplomats.
                    It was so different from my experience in Kenya —I had an advance car, an armed
                    guard in my vehicle and a chase car with more armed guards.</p>
                <p>What was not at all different from Nairobi was the chancery. It was, in fact, the
                    exact duplicate in architecture of the one that had been blown up. It was also
                    on a main street with little offset, and not on any list to be moved. You can
                    just imagine the conversation with the heads of FBO and Diplomatic Security,
                    who, by the way, refused to see me individually. I found that rather amusinless
                    so when they asked “Why are you always going to embassies with no offset?” The
                    three of us negotiated an agreement because, once again, the list of chanceries
                    to be replaced did not include the one I was going to. The Assistant Secretaries
                    promised they would respond as best they could to suggestions to improve the
                    security if I would refrain from sending the kinds of cables I sent from
                    Nairobi.</p>
                <p>The first day I went to work, the driver out of habit drove the car into the
                    embassy's underground parking lot, again a duplicate to the one in Nairobi.
                    Every cell in my body went into panic mode, I mean every cell. I told myself,
                    “it's okay, it's okay; this is not Nairobi. You will not make an entrance by
                    screaming down the corridors!” Eventually, of course I got used to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>The arrangement we came to with Diplomatic Security and FBO was to purchase the
                    apartment building next door and entice Guatemala City's Mayor to close the
                    other streets around us. A costly but effective way of gaining security
                    perimeters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, when you went to Guatemala you were there from
                        when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I was there from 1999 to 2002.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of relations between Guatemala and the
                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: For the most part, pretty good because President Clinton had apologized
                    for the role the U.S. had played in orchestrating the 1954 coup d'etat that
                    began 35 years of internal conflict. This was a country in which the “war
                    against communism” was played out in horrible and vicious ways. The human rights
                    abuses were outrageous. In 1996, Peace Accords were signed that essentially
                    reformulated the social contract between the government and the people and among
                    the people themselves. They articulated exceedingly ambitious changes that would
                    not easily be implemented. As a result, they were only partially and
                    superficially implemented. The Accords provided an absence of war, not yet peace
                    and tranquility.</p>
                <p>The U.S. government was very invested in the negotiation and the success of the
                    Peace Accords, to the tune of about three-hundred-million dollars in AID
                    programs. Coming from Africa, I was stunned. Three hundred million dollars for
                    this little country when the best the entire continent of sub-Saharan Africa
                    could manage was eight hundred million!</p>
                <p>Most of our programs were focused in the Mayan highlands, where much of the
                    conflict had taken place. We were investing in education, particularly for women
                    and girls, health systems, the rule of law, the environmena variety of areas.
                    Our efforts were to facilitate implementation of the Peace Accords as fast and
                    smoothly as possible. On the surface, the Guatemalan government was giving lip
                    service to peace, to donors like the U.S. that were providing funding. In
                    reality, social change was moving at a snail's pace, the Presidential Guard was
                    almost literally holding the president as hostage, and corruption was
                    rampant.</p>
                <p>Conditions worsened under the tenure of President Portillo, who was voted into
                    office at the end of '99, three months after my arrival. As an example, a “white
                    budget” existed for military expenditures that could be audited, but the actual
                    budget was something else again. The military was up to its neck in corruption,
                    intimidation and cover up. The country was still awash with mistrust and
                    hatred.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. Well, we will stop at this point. You've just entered
                        Guatemala City. You talked about this theater of Guatemala politics and
                        implementing the Peace Accords.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 16th of September, 2005. Pru, just listening to that last thing. At
                    some point we wanted to get into the undercurrents in the political life as you
                    got to learn all sorts of things going on within that society. How does one who
                    is parachuted in to a complex society, a cooking pt like Guatemala learn about
                    what is going on and what to do?</p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: First of all, I did my homework before arriving. Having served as
                    ambassador and DAS I knew the kinds of reports and information to look for. I
                    also crammed for my confirmation hearings, which I had about 10 days after
                    leaving Kenya. I held a roundtable discussion of desk officers from the agencies
                    around town invested in our policies on Guatemala in addition to individual
                    consultations. What I discovered was a huge split in the interagency group
                    between those who felt we should work closely with the Guatemalan military and
                    those focused on implementing the Peace Accords and improving on human rights. I
                    frankly agreed with them because the Guatemalan military still had a lot to
                    account for.</p>
                <p>I have to say that I really began to question the attitude of the U.S. military,
                    which was very different from the attitude of it held toward sub-Saharan African
                    countries. There I found.....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: In AF circles of the U.S. government, civilians and military were in
                    complete agreement about what needed to be done to improve military performance
                    and relations and with civilian governments. That was not at all the case of the
                    interagency group focused on Guatemala. The U.S. military people I spoke to
                    really wanted to embrace the Guatemalan military. They assured me, for example,
                    that the Guatemala military was really “quite civilized” because they knew how
                    to use forks and spoke English. I came away thinking that we're in big trouble
                    if that's the basis on which we reach conclusions in Washington. While I was not
                    familiar with the details of the Guatemalan conflict and its military, I was no
                    stranger to the issues of conflict and the legacy that conflict and terror
                    leave.</p>
                <p>When we arrived in Guatemala, I intentionally got out of the capital and into the
                    country side as soon as I could. I wanted first-hand knowledge; visiting AID and
                    Peace Corps projects easily provided that. I think the first radio broadcast I
                    did was from outside the capital.</p>
                <p>Dick and I had a lot of interaction with Americans and Guatemalan employees of
                    the mission so I picked things up that way. What probably helped most was the
                    presidential campaign that began soon after my arrival. A lot of issues came to
                    the surface.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Washington had given me two charges: To put pressure on the government to improve
                    its human rights recorspecifically, to get to the bottom of the murder of Bishop
                    Gerardi, a human rights activist - and to persuade the government to disband the
                    Estado Mayor, the Presidential Guard, which had a lock on the Presidency both
                    literally and figuratively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a commandant of the presidential guard? I mean,
                        was he the man or was it a sort of a junta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was a junta more than a specific person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a Noriega or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, no. It was much more a band of brothers, elites in the
                    military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah. It sort of sounds a little bit the latter days of
                        the Roman Empire, it was a praetorian guard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes. They did everything from baking bread to keeping the President's
                    calendar, providing his security and driving his car. They controlled
                    everything, using sophisticated communications equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to dealing with these two things, a murder
                        investigation and trying to do something about this elite group of military
                        guys, what were your impressions, because particularly getting out into the
                        field was so important when you got there. I mean, particularly talking to
                        people like the Peace Corps and people who were out there working in the
                        field. What were you getting from looking at the campesinos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It doesn't take long to see the disparity of incomes. There are a few
                    very, very wealthy families, some middle class and a mass of very poor people.
                    Guatemala was second only to Haiti in statistics regarding poverty, maternal
                    death, infant deaths, etc. It was second only to Columbia in gun ownership,
                    violence, and kidnapping. And yet, perhaps this is apocryphal, I was told the
                    country had the highest per capita rate of privately owned helicopters in the
                    world. It did not take long to pick up a virulent strain of racism among some
                    Guatemalan elites, nor the hard, cold mistrust of the Mayan people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, what were you getting from some of our
                        observers in the field, either the Peace Corps or, missionaries? What were
                        they saying, because they were obviously dealing with the indigenous more
                        than others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: There's a sizeable expat community, but most of the expats were in
                    commerce, or hippies who had stayed. We had some, but not </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that area was flooded with evangelicals, because
                        they were, you know, taking the Catholics to the cleaners.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: But they weren't necessarily American evangelicals. Among Peace Corps
                    and AID workers there was great concern about the pace of the peace process and
                    about the continuing terror under which human rights advocates lived. There was
                    also frustration about the lack of accountability for some of the abuses that
                    had taken place during and after the conflict. Plus, an appallingly low rate of
                    government investment in the country. Government services were practically
                    non-existent, in large part because people didn't believe in paying taxes.</p>
                <p>I had never seen a system that was set up to fail as effectively as the
                    Guatemalan government. A president's term of office was limited to one four year
                    term. Incumbents would fire everyone from the prior government to bring in a
                    team that often didn't know their way around the building, much less government.
                    They had very few revenues with which to work, a military that was not trusted
                    and endemic corruption. Add to that, a profound mistrust of a huge Mayan
                    population and a great division between the Ladino and Mayan people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the officer corps coming from, because in lots
                        of Latin America the officer corps is the place for the poor people to work
                        their way up? Was this happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Regardless of their personal roots, the military was responsive to the
                    elites. It a symbiotic relationship — elites allowed the military to go keep the
                    government and countryside under wraps and in return, the military ensured that
                    reforms — labor reform, tax reform, any kind of reforwere kept at bay so the
                    elites could make the money they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the money coming from to feed the
                        Oligarchs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Guatemala is a resource rich country. There is no reason in the world
                    for this country to be poor. That was part of what made me profoundly frustrated
                    and angry. It has better tourist potential than Costa Rica. It has Mayan ruins;
                    it has Spanish colonial ruins from the time it housed the capital. Guatemala has
                    beaches; it has mountains; it has a wonderful climate and some areas of very
                    fertile land. It is known for exotic fruits and vegetables and extraordinary
                    coffee. It is also blessed with an incredibly hard-working people, both Mayan
                    and Ladino, and a strong work ethic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say here you have a very wealthy country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A potentially wealthy country — with a rate of illiteracy among Mayan
                    women of something like 92 per cent and among Mayan men of something like 85 per
                    cent. Children of the elites go to school surrounded by bodyguards while other
                    children of Mayans tend the fields helping to eek out a living. In colonial
                    society Mayans were required to wear the costume of their village. Each village
                    had different patterns and colors to their hand woven fabric. This would
                    identify them anytime they left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was an identifier, like the star of David or
                        something like that, although prettier</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A whole lot prettier. To this day you will find that lot of the women
                    still keep their indigenous costumes. But as pretty and colorful as Guatemala
                    appears on the surface, 36 years of internal conflict, along with a lot of guns
                    and grinding poverty gave rise to high rates of crime , including
                    kidnapping..</p>
                <p>In the middle, between the Mayan people at one end of the spectrum and the
                    oligarchs at the other, you had a middle class that was exceedingly conservative
                    and fatalistic. A woman architect I once met told that when she and her husband
                    entertained at dinner she never engaged in social conversation because it wasn't
                    appropriate and, as a woman she didn't have anything to contribute. Given that
                    cultural attitude, you can imagine what a lot of people thought of me as woman
                    ambassador outspoken on human rights and reform issues! I raised hackles more
                    than once. People wrote editorials to the Wall Street Journal about me a few
                    times</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you observed, because you parachuted into this
                        society, was certainly not unfamiliar to American diplomacy. We've been
                        involved there forever. Let's go from after World War II, when we started
                        getting involved. What were we doing? Was this sort of a passive, let's keep
                        them, long as they don't bother us we won't worry about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We were there, front and center, in the post World War II years. We had
                    a base there during World War II; Guatemalans were allies. The first democratic
                    elections after the war brought in Jacobo Arbenz-Guzman, who campaigned in part
                    on a platform of land reform. Efforts to buy land from the United Fruit Company,
                    which had enjoyed favored status, to put it mildly, led to concerns that Arbenz
                    had communist proclivities. At the time, John Foster Dulles was Secretary of
                    State while his brother, Allan, was head of CIA. At least one, perhaps both were
                    on the Board of United Fruit.</p>
                <p>These men helped orchestrate a coup against Arbenz, in 1954 with the active
                    participation of our ambassador. This sowed the seeds for the horrendous
                    conflict and loss of life that was to follow for decades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It stands as a black mark on American diplomacy. It's sort
                        of a benchmark. It's been thrown in our face ever since.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: As it should be. I personally think it is quite outrageous that a
                    couple of guys on the board of a fruit company could decide that what's good for
                    the fruit company is good for the United States government and that justifies
                    the fabrication of reasons for the overthrow of a democratically elected head of
                    state. Again, I come back to the oligarchs. We were hand in hand with the landed
                    elites who wanted to continue to control the economy and the people and worked
                    through military regimes to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's extremely important to take a look at this issue.
                        Here you are, again, this is the thing about American ambassadors, they
                        arrive and often they arrive with a different view that somebody who's grown
                        up learning to accept the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: By the time I arrived in Guatemala it was well known that we, the U.S.,
                    had created the coup. President Clinton had visited Guatemala about a year
                    before I arrived. He both acknowledged and apologized. That act made it easy for
                    me to publicly acknowledge that sometimes governments do horrible things. Given
                    our investment, I could also add that we are now investing $300 million in the
                    peace process as part of an effort to do right by the Guatemalan people.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>On the day I presented credentials I was told to deliver a demarche that the
                    Guatemalan government needed to address some issue of concern to us. I don't
                    remember exactly whicit was either to disband the presidential guard or act on
                    the human rights issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was disbanding the presidential guard part of the peace
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Definitely was. So here I was in a formal ceremony before clicking TV
                    cameras, smiling as I advised the President that I needed to talk to him about a
                    serious issue. Every time I see the photograph of the smiling new ambassador and
                    attentive president, I am reminded about how much of diplomacy has to do with
                    theatrics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arriving on top of an election, everybody getting out, did
                        you feel that you were going to have to sort of save your ammunition, to
                        start all over again or were you able to talk to the candidates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The U.S. ambassador in Guatemala is perceived to have so much power, I
                    intentionally stayed away from the candidates except to make the requisite
                    courtesy calls on both of them. One of them made the appointment to see me and
                    had his photo taken outside the residence, underneath our government seal.
                    Naturally, the press accused me of favoring him. I had been manipulated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quickly have to go over and get the other guy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You bet. Actually, I'd been trying to see him. But in the meantime, I
                    tried to get as much movement out of the current government as I could. This was
                    when I learned about the fuerzas obscuras, the dark forces, they were called.
                    The foreign minister came to the Residence one evening, sat down in the library
                    and told me all about the dark forces and why this government could not
                    eliminate the presidential guard before they left power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the presidential guard the dark force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: He didn't say they were but the implication was that they were
                    certainly a part. Nobody would ever identify the fuerzas obscuras. I found this
                    frustrating given my familiarity with “dark forces” in Rwanda, Liberia, Burundi
                    and other parts of Africto say nothing of having been blown up by al Qaeda. I
                    didn't buy the fact that in such a small country as Guatemala, where networks
                    are close and well connected, no one would know who these fuerzas obscuras
                    were.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a handy way for them to avoid naming names?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Probably, but I recognized that they were legitimately concerned, with
                    good reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't want to know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I don't know. It was hard for me to understand Guatemalans. I've
                    learned that I can only try to hear what people are saying and explore as much
                    as I can. But to get into somebody else's head, especially in a society as
                    complicated as the Guatemalan society, is too much of a reach. So I pretty much
                    took things at face value.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of crusading reporters who were trying
                        to get into this or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Crusaders ended up dead. Bishop Gerardi, whose murder was a source of
                    great concern to the U.S., was a crusader. One of my charges from Washington was
                    to promote labor reform and I saw first hand what happened to reformers. A group
                    of agricultural workers planned a parade to highlight an issuI forget which.
                    Anyway, on the eve of the parade the organizers were hauled out of their homes,
                    taken to the local radio station and with guns to their heads were told to
                    announce that the parade had been called off. We spent two years trying to get
                    the people who had done this held accountable. Everybody knew who they were;
                    they did it casually. And yet people were terrified to testify against them
                    because they were pretty sure they would end up dead. To convince anyone to
                    testify against these hooligans meant arranging asylum for them and their
                    families in the U.S.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived I baulked at the idea of having nine bodyguards around me
                    literally 24-hours a day. The RSO persuaded me to hold off making a decision for
                    a few months and it didn't take me even that long to understand the wisdom of
                    keeping them given my proclivity for activism.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, when you arrived there, the staff of

                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: My predecessor had a different way of doing business so we had little
                    contact with the political opposition partwhich won the elections. My priorities
                    during the first few months focused on getting the Country Team and other staff
                    to set objectives we could achieve. When the Portillo government was voted into
                    office with all of the right rhetoric, we set our goals pretty high. Over the
                    course of the next two and a half years, we found ourselves lowering the bar
                    further and further. By the time we left, we were struggling simply to maintain
                    what little ground we had gained in the implementation of the Peace Accords,
                    respect of human rights and rule of law, a change in the culture of corruption
                    and impunity, and so on.,</p>

                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It had been decimated. I don't know if you remember the congressional
                    hearing during the eightieabout the same time Iran-Contra was the scandal of the
                    day. The CIA took a licking. In the 90s, budget cuts forced the closing of
                    stations all around the world, including Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived in Guatemala during the waning days of the
                        Clinton administration. How was the United States seen at that time in
                        Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The elites were certainly waiting with bated breath for the
                    conservatives to come back into power in the United States. They figured that
                    the issues I was promoting as ambassadohuman rights, tax reform, labor reform,
                    intellectual property rights and the likwould go away with the return of a
                    Republican White House. One of the first demonstrations in front of the embassy
                    against me was a “spontaneous uprising” of the street peddlers protesting my
                    remarks about intellectual property rights.</p>

                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, yes. Another subject I was told to raise during the last days of
                    the Clinton administration was labor reform. Specifically, the reforms the
                    Guatemalans had signed in 1952 but never ratified. I was instructed to tell the
                    government and Parliament that we would cut Guatemala from the General System of
                    Tariff Preferences if they didn't legislate intellectual property right reforms,
                    which they eventually did. I was also instructed to warn them that Guatemala
                    would be removed them from the Caribbean Basin Initiative if they did not ratify
                    labor reforms. When I delivered these messages the attitude I got was “Yeah,
                    yeah, yeah. Come back after your elections.” I advised them that they shouldn't
                    be so cocky, that should the Republicans win, the Republicans may want to tip
                    their hat to labor, no reason why the Bush Administration would want to
                    gratuitously insult the American labor community and what better way than to
                    continue to insist that labor reform and basic labor reform, signed in 1952, be
                    ratified. And sure enough, that's exactly what happened.</p>
                <p>But let me talk about Guatemalan elections first. The candidate who won, Alfonso
                    Portillo, was a populist and a horror in the eyes of the elites. His political
                    party was run by Efrain Rios-Montt, a military dictator who had seized power in
                    the 80s and went on to sponsor the most bloody and most repressive years of the
                    internal conflict. He supplemented the military with civilian militias, giving
                    them guns and saying, “Okay, go kill people in the villages over there.” He had
                    Mayans kill other Mayans and implemented a deliberate strategy to accomplish
                    three things: engage in conflict in the countryside; keep the mayhem away from
                    the Guatemala City; and punish the people fighting the military — punish them,
                    their families, their children, their fields, and their villages. People were
                    baffled that Mayans would vote for the very man who created such horrors. But
                    they did.</p>
                <p>The elites decided that the sky had fallen, that hell had frozen over, that
                    nothing worse could ever happen and that the American ambassador would, of
                    course, have nothing to do with him. I didn't have that option, nor would I have
                    chosen it initially because, as I said, Portillo was mouthing all of the right
                    things about human rights, tax structures, reforming the presidential guard,
                    implementing the Peace Accordeverything the U.S. government wanted to hear. I
                    was lambasted in the press for dealing with the new government.</p>
                <p>Portillo didn't speak a word of English, which was good for my Spanish, and was
                    clueless about putting a government together. He had been a university professor
                    in Mexico and made no bones about the fact that he left Mexico before he was
                    brought to justice for killing. What a guy. Actually, he was more of a little
                    popinjay with a big ego.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>He lived near the Residence and would frequently come for breakfast. Over the
                    period of two and a half years, my end of the conversations deteriorated. At the
                    beginning of his administration I would start with something like “So, Mr.
                    President, wonderful that you're saying all these good things. Certainly hope
                    that you will implement them.” This morphed into “Mr. President, it's now been
                    six months, eight months, nine months, twelve months, two years since you have
                    been talking about reforms but you still haven't implemented them. Things are
                    getting serious.”</p>
                <p>I initially thought part of the reason he couldn't get anything done was an
                    ignorance of basic management. I invited Portillo and his vice president for
                    breakfast one day and asked each of them to answer the two things in writing. 1)
                    Three things I want to be sure to implement during my term of office. And 2) I
                    would like to be known in history as....” Once they wrote their answers down I
                    asked them to exchange papers. At one point I thought to myself, “I can't
                    believe that I'm doing this.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like one of your management sessions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It was, but it sure didn't accomplish anything of particular good. As
                    time went on, conditions in the country degenerated further. One of my last
                    private conversations with Portillo ended with the following. “Mr. President, we
                    know for a fact that your personal secretary is accepting money from drug
                    dealers.” Portillo responded: “So that must mean you think that the money ends
                    up with me.” I shrugged and replied “Mr. President, what can I say?”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He would accept this and still come for breakfast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, he would. I think that women can say things that would get other
                    men in big trouble. Women colleagues have noted that, as well. Trust at some
                    level is easier to establish, men do not feel as threatened by women, and a
                    particular tone of voice can allow us to say the kinds of things, like “Mr.
                    President, stealing isn't going to do you any good. You don't want to end up in
                    history as one of the greatest thieves in the country, do you?” “No?” “Well,
                    then, you just have to stop.”</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: That's what men always say when women give negative feedback. Think of
                    it this way: the U.S. ambassador is advising a head of state to stop stealing
                    while continuing her ability to influence. When National Geographic did a video
                    called, “Inside an Embassy.” Portillo was asked to say a few words on camera.
                    Know what he said? “Relations between our two countries have never been as good
                    and this ambassador, she's really good. You know, she pulls my ear now and then
                    and tells me to shape up.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Jesse Helms connection. Senator from
                        North Carolina, very right wing but very interested, either himself or some
                        people on his staff, in Central America. How did that play in your
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I found that there was an equal degree of skepticism on both the
                    Democrat and Republican front as to whether Portillo was going to fulfill his
                    promises. The few people in the Congress interested in Central America agreed on
                    the need for good leadership and it didn't look as though Portillo would
                    deliver. I've never played partisan politics overseas and I found Helms staffers
                    personally supportive of my efforts. I know that some Guatemalan business elites
                    wrote to Helms requesting my recall because of the pressure I was putting on
                    issues of labor rights, intellectual property rights and other reforms, but I
                    never got a bit of flak from Senator Helms or any of his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any congressional delegations while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We got a couple. They were always bipartisan and supportive of what I
                    was doing. There's never any disconnect about our policy toward Guatemala,
                    except within the interagency over the degree to which we should embrace the
                    Guatemalan military. We had a sizable military component in the embassy left
                    over from the conflict dayI think we had over 20 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good number.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: It is considering that our policy was to exert pressure on the
                    Guatemalan military to be respectful of civilian rule and to hold accountable
                    people who had abused human rights or were continuing to do so. I was unwilling
                    to support efforts to cozy up but never any issues with the Southern Command
                    generals at the four star level.</p>

                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Miami. My issues were with the rank and file at post. While they never
                    confronted me directly about it, some of the military reps in the embassy were
                    furious because I put one of the exercises on hold. The entire military
                    contingent boycotted my farewell events. They were also outraged that I did not
                    personally greet the Southern Command four star at the airport when he visited.
                    The decision was an intentional one — I wanted to be clear that, although I did
                    not have the money, staff or toys he did, it was the ambassador who represented
                    the President of the United States. I was gracious but I felt no need to be at
                    the steps of the airplane. Some people disagreed with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you raise this issue at all with the four star, when
                        he came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You mean the number of people we had at post?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well no, just, well, two things, then. One, the size of
                        the military contingent compared to what we were doing. And the other one,
                        the reason you didn't greet him at the airport</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I saw no need to do that. And I never felt any tension from the
                    senior commanders on that issue. The tension was coming from the colonels and
                    the lieutenant colonels. I always got along famously with the senior people,
                    both on protocol and policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any effort to sort of reduce the size of
                        the staff, because, if you're trying to, well, as I said, you have to keep
                        them busy and what do they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I raised the issue and finally got a policy review in Washington after
                    I had left. I'm frankly not sure what they did. When I leave a posting, I close
                    the door.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of these exercises were going into, particularly into
                        Central America, were National Guard engineer units going in and building a
                        road or doing something like that and it's good training for the National
                        Guard. This is before we got so involved in Iraq and other places. Was this
                        a pattern? Was that going on or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I had absolutely no problem with these kinds of exercises. Civil
                    affairs kinds of exercises were fine. During one of them they sent a helicopter
                    into the jungle to lift out, intact, an ancient Mayan stele, a carved stone. No
                    stele had ever been retrieved intact. It ended up at the museum in Guatemala
                    City, and gave the U.S. military as well as the embasswonderful publicity. So
                    there were creative things that we were doing. But the issue of how strongly we
                    should embrace the military was a source of tension.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you feel that the, was the tension because, the
                        colonels wanted to have something, they're sent there to work with the
                        military. What were they supposed to be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I never told them they couldn't do their work, I simply wanted them to
                    support the policies we had agreed upon in both letter and spirit. Understand
                    that the Guatemalan military was involved in drug trafficking, alien smuggling,
                    illicit trade, harassment and killing of human rights and reform leaderto say
                    nothing of the hold they exerted on the head of state. They wanted nothing more
                    than tacit or explicit support from the U.S. That was not something I would be a
                    party to.</p>
                <p>When Pete Pace took over Southern Command and came for a courtesy call, I invited
                    the Chief of Staff of the Guatemalan military for a private conversation at the
                    Residence. He went on and on about how the two of them were “brothers who
                    understand one another because we know what it is to shed blood. We have seen
                    blood. Civilians never do.” I had to interrupt because this particular civilian
                    had seen blood. I wasn't going to sit there in my own residence and watch
                    silently the attempted seduction of an American general under the guise of the
                    special link culture warriors share.</p>
                <p>On another occasion I intervened when our Defense Attache was going to attend the
                    promotion ceremony of a colonel we knew was a drug runner. I had to order him
                    not to attend that particular ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose that you were running into a different culture
                        that had been around since the time of William Walker, I guess of Nicaragua
                        or something, back in the 1850's or so. I mean a very close relationship.
                        Also my understanding is that, a lot of these Central American posts, were
                        good places to send colonels before retirement. It was a cushy job and you
                        were breaking rice bowls if you tried to do something about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSNELL: I went to Guatemala with the intention to help promote the changes
                    Guatemalans had spelled out in the Peace Accords. And in that respect I was
                    “good for Guatemala” because I know how to promote change and turn ideas into
                    reality. But what I learned was that the Peace Accords were only words on paper.
                    People who benefited from the system that had created the domestic conflict
                    meant to stay in charge. Some of the elites and some of the military were using
                    one another.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>In terms of the change the U.S. government was seeking I was the right person at
                    the right time. I took my job very seriously, I pushed on a lot of issues and
                    achieved significant successes while maintaining a good relationship with the
                    government, so that we got the votes we wanted in international issues a like
                    the Human Rights Commission votes against Cuba. But, in terms of my position
                    vis-�-vis people who wanted to maintain their lock on power, I was the wrong
                    person. In their view, very much the wrong person. As a result it was a very
                    tough post for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the tension that you're talking about between
                        you and the military, the American military, did that play over into the
                        Central American hands in your political-economic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: No, I deliberately had a DCM and political counselors with significant
                    Central American experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did they see things the way you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, absolutely. As I think I said before, I had a series of
                    goal-setting session with the Country Team to agree on our interagency focus.
                    Our military reps never said a word in these discussions. Their beef was with me
                    and their push-back was very subtle. I don't want to make too much of it because
                    we accomplished things as a team that I'm very proud of.</p>
                <p>We had an investment of $300 million in the peace process from the AID side, and
                    if you look, if you combined all of the investments of all of the agencies at
                    post it would have been considerably more. One of the objectives we set as a
                    Country Team was to address corruption. When I convened people from AID, DEA,
                    INS, as it was called then, and other law enforcement agencies to chart the
                    links between corrupt people in the Guatemalan government, we were able to
                    identify particular individuals. We went back to Washington and received
                    authorization to revoke their visas. This took some time because we had to
                    follow the letter of American law, but what we accomplished was the revocation
                    of visas of some of the members of the fuerzas obscuras, the “dark forces” that
                    the president and others had talked about. After September 11, 2001 drug running
                    and alien smuggling became an important national security issue for us and we
                    did something about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we're also talking about people on your team, had
                        money to hand out. Could we do anything on that, to make sure the money
                        didn't go to the wrong people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: AID, which had the bulk of it, had very strong controls. We withheld
                    other monies. As an example, we had representatives of ICITAP, which is the part
                    of the Justice Department that runs police programs. They wanted to set up a
                    forensic lab for the Guatemalan police. Unfortunately, the Guatemalans
                    prosecutors and the police were in a bitter feud over the issue of evidence
                    control. As a result, lots of evidence was lost. The justice system was horrible
                    to begin with and it was not helped by the turf wars between the prosecutor and
                    the police. So I said that until prosecutors and police could come to agreement,
                    no one would get the money. Alien smuggling was another big issue that got a lot
                    of our attention, although it did not directly connect to any particular funding
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the aliens they were smuggling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't limited to Guatemalans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Oh, no. We dealt with boatloads of Chinese and mixed groups including
                    Iranians, Egyptians, and even an Australian — people from all over the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How can you alien smuggle to the United States out of
                        Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Because once they got into Mexico it was a free ride. The U.S.
                    government had made the shores of Mexico a no-go zone. So the smugglers chose
                    the shores of Guatemala</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was nothing we could do about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We could yak and yak and yak into the ears of Guatemalan officials. But
                    one of the military, one of the admirals, was complicit. We also turned the
                    screws of airport controls. I focused my efforts on those aspects of corruption
                    that would have greatest impact on the national security of the United States.
                    We knew there was no al Qaeda or militant Islamist cell in Guatemala, but we
                    also knew there were porous borders that enabled people to pass through
                    Guatemala into the United States.</p>
                <p>I also tried, as I did in Kenya, to organize a group of the key donor countries.
                    We called ourselves the Grupo de Dialogo and were quite successful in getting
                    attention in the press to issues of corruption and other Peace Accord issues.
                    Unfortunately, the multilateral banks, like the World Bank and Inter American
                    Fund consider it their job to give out money, so we only had a minimal impact in
                    using funding as a lever of influence.</p>

                <p>As we speak, the man who was Vice President of Guatemala at the time I was there
                    is now in jail. Former President Portillo slipped over the border back to Mexico
                    with the posse behind him...literally. So much for the gang I dealt with.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, actually, the people who have taken over are, for the most part,
                    pretty law abiding and decent.</p>

                        One was corruption.. What were others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We got legislation for intellectual property rights. We got labor
                    reforms on the books. We successfully pressed for the trial of the man who
                    killed Bishop Gerardi. We even got members of the government, private sector and
                    media to talk with one another about mutual issues of concern. I purchased many
                    Spanish translated copies of the book Getting to Yes. I don't know if you have
                    heard of it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Getting to Yes. It is a Harvard negotiating technique about how to get
                    satisfaction on each side of a negotiation. I handed out copies to everyone I
                    came in contact with to see if people from various sectors could build some
                    bridges. I would invite people to the Residence for discussions and used my
                    background as a facilitator to promote a dialogue. I also hosted a lot of
                    musical events at the Residence to bring people who would normally never speak
                    to one another together to enjoy an evening in one another's company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of music, by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Actually, all kinds. We had American off-Broadway groups, opera and
                    there were a number of local jazz musicians. Guatemalans discovered the musical
                    talents of people within their midst, which was great. Our Public Affairs people
                    had an American producer to work with young Guatemalans to do West Side Story.
                    We were told Guatemalans don't sing and dance, but of course they do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Romeo and Juliet, there it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: This again was an effort to promote bridges. It was such a success that
                    we did another, Once Upon an Island, with a similar theme. One of the lead
                    players ended up going to the United States on a scholarship.</p>
                <p>Another Country Team project about which I was very proud was bringing to public
                    attention the deaths of children in certain areas of Guatemala from
                    malnutrition. This was a great example of globalization. The price of coffee in
                    the world market had plummeted, in large part because of a glut of Vietnamese
                    coffee, which USAID had helped them develop. Although Guatemalan coffee was far
                    superior to most other, it had not yet become a niche market and so was highly
                    susceptible to global economic forces. When prices fell, coffee growers stopped
                    harvesting. The coffee pickers, who lived a marginal existence in the best of
                    times, received no wages with which to buy staples and children began to die. We
                    brought this to Washington's attention and began working with various sectors of
                    Guatemala. It was a strugglAID/Washington did not consider death by malnutrition
                    an emergency and the Guatemalan government couldn't have cared. I got on my high
                    horse with both governments, while our public affairs and AID people created a
                    campaign to bring information to the media and public. I think we saved some
                    lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the problem being that Guatemala produced
                        gourmet type coffee. Now by the time we're talking coffee has become a big
                        business and gourmet, Starbucks and other outfits in the United States,
                        chains were pushing fancy coffee. Was that having any impact in
                        Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSNELL: As the niche market developed in the U.S., Guatemala benefited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things we haven't touched on, I'm looking at my
                        map of Central America and Guatemala has got interesting neighbors. It's got
                        Mexico, which is about half of it. It's got Belize off to one side, Honduras
                        and El Salvador. Maybe take each one separately. What about relations with
                        Mexico? Where's Chiapas? Is that in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, Chiapas borders on Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there'd been a simmering revolt, I guess there still
                        is, in Mexico from Chiapas over basically peasants, natives, Indians or
                        whatever. Did that spill over? Was that a tonal factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Relations with Mexico had the kinds of tensions neighbors often
                    experience, especially if one is bigger and more advanced. On the whole, they
                    were very good, however. Mexico had a terrific ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a colossus to the north.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Exactly. It was a friendly tension - unlike the relationship with
                    Belize. At one time in history, Belize had belonged to Guatemala and a border
                    dispute simmered for years. It had been settled by the time I left. El Salvador,
                    Honduras and Nicaragua also had land and maritime border issues but although
                    there were periodic spikes in tension, relations remained on an even keel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other countries' embassies there and all?
                        Some of the initiatives you're talking about, anti-corruption feeling,
                        malnourished children and other efforts, did you end up as the leader or
                        were they involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The Nordics were very involved in the Peace Accords. The Swedish and
                    Norwegian ambassadors were very active. So was the Spanish ambassador. The U.S.
                    ambassador was irresistible to the media however. This had less to do with the
                    incumbent than the fact of representing the United States. For an activist like
                    myself, that had a real downside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it's interesting when one looks at diplomatic corps
                        and all. If the American ambassador in most countries wants to be active he
                        can move ahead. But you sense that, European countries and Latin American
                        countries have a tendency to be observers. Did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: A lot depends on the personalities of the ambassadors. I have worked
                    with a Japanese ambassador who was very forward leaning and have known a couple
                    of Japanese ambassadors who tended toward great reticence. As to Europeans, most
                    have to work through the European Union, which is very cumbersome. My experience
                    is that the way any ambassador implements instructions from government is highly
                    individualized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Guatemalan community, which is so apparent right
                        here in the Washington area play any role, or do these sort of immigrants
                        keep their heads down or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: They played a role during elections through absentee ballots and, of
                    course, the remittances they sent home had a huge economic impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impact of September 11th, 2001?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Guatemalans perceived the U.S. to be invulnerable and, like so many
                    others around the world, were shocked. The embassy was flooded with flowers. One
                    young man bearing a bouquet asked the Protocol Assistant to let me know that he
                    had recently participated in a demonstration against me. That was professional,
                    he said; these flowers are personal. I thought it was very cute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should cover about this
                        particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I left Guatemala with mixed feelings. I thought that the mission team
                    could point to significant achievements but I was personally exhausted from the
                    efforts. I had never been so vilified on the one hand and yet satisfied about
                    what we accomplished. Even one-time critics in the media admitted I had made a
                    positive difference. As to Guatemala as a whole, I felt that the level of
                    mistrust and violence would shackle it for years. Yet, I was also struck by the
                    sense of optimism among so many Mayan people who had and continue to suffer the
                    most. Most of all, I left with a sense of having survived one tough
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've been talking to many people who've been ambassadors.
                        There are sort of can-do ambassadors — Tom Pickering, Deane Hinton — and,
                        there are others who sort of move around. I would have thought this
                        assignment would have raised your profile. You have any feel that anybody
                        was keeping book on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The promotion panel waI was promoted to Career Minister. On the other I
                    hand, no “home” bureau anymore and no encouragement from the central system,
                    i.e. the DG's office to seek a further assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not in the old boys' network or the equivalent, gals'
                        network.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: At the most senior levels the gals' network doesn't exist and the old
                    boys' network is at its most competitive. Plus, State Department culture in
                    Washington is a very political culture. The kind of leadership that makes an
                    activist ambassador effective is neither welcomed nor rewarded. In Washington,
                    senior career people are expected to be implementers and managers of policy, not
                    leaders of people or policy. We still have an old-fashioned system in which the
                    most important work is done by the most senior level people. Everyone else is
                    expected to feed the next level up. It's a huge expenditure of time for possibly
                    minimal results. But there you are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Guatemala when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: In 2002.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pru, you're getting out of the garden spot of Guatemala
                        and leaving your bodyguard behind I guess and heading for the more dangerous
                        area of Washington, D.C., the political swamp. Tell me about your
                        assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I had been offered some DAS jobs but was not interested in becoming a
                    deputy again. I was frankly thinking of leaving the Service when plans fell
                    through and I found myself actively looking for an interesting assignment. I saw
                    that the job as Dean of the Leadership and Management School was still open and
                    called Kathy Peterson, the Director of the Foreign Service Institute. I
                    considered the job a gift of the cosmos. The last three years turned out to be
                    among the best of my career. This has been a wonderful place from which to pass
                    on what I learned to other people coming through the ranks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you tell us a bit about the genesis of this job and
                        what it entailed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, remember I had earlier headed up the Executive Development
                    Division in the School of Professional Studies from '86 to '80. Around 2001, it
                    was incorporated, along with the Senior Seminar and all management and crisis
                    training divisions into the newly created Leadership and Management School —
                    LMS.</p>
                <p>Secretary Powell, who was appalled by the lack of leadership and management
                    training State Department employees received, mandated leadership training for
                    all Civil and Foreign Service people from GS 13/FS 03 through newly promoted
                    senior executive and Foreign Service personnel. I arrived at the point when that
                    mandate was to be implemented, which meant training 7,000 people by the end of
                    calendar year 2006. From then on, leadership training would be a prerequisite to
                    promotion. People promoted into the senior service would have to take the
                    equivalent of a capstone seminar within the first year of their promotion. The
                    new training was added to the 49 courses LMS already offered.</p>
                <p>LMS also had the challenge of becoming an organization with a single identity and
                    a brand. The co-locating divisions from different parts of the Foreign Service
                    Institute into one building and calling them a school did not make it so in any
                    real sense. I had worked with some of the LMS staff in the 80s and had a great
                    deal of respect for them. I knew the very high caliber of their work and I
                    wanted to turn the Leadership and Management School into the Harvard of
                    Washington training. What the team accomplished over the three years I was there
                    was absolutely extraordinary and a hell of a good time.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>We were lucky because Powell had created the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative
                    designed to make up the numbers of personnel slots we had lost during the famine
                    days of the nineties. For years we had been hiring to one third of retention:
                    two thirds of the people who left were never replaced. Powell wanted to get back
                    to hiring to the numbers who were leaving in any one year plus and have a ten
                    per cent float to enable people to have training. With the resources we
                    received, we had the means to fulfill his mandate and maintain a high standard
                    of training and morale among our direct hire staff and contractors.</p>
                <p>We had several delicious challenges. One was to create a better sense of
                    understanding among the different tribes of the Department. Civil Service,
                    Foreign Service generalists and specialists and contractors all inhabited the
                    same organizations with different hiring and promotion systems, and different
                    ways of attitudes toward work and one another. What they all have in common is a
                    ferocious desire to do a good job on behalf of the American people. In our
                    training programs we wanted people to appreciate both diverse and common
                    values.</p>
                <p>Some of my LMS colleagues were understandably skeptical of our ability to come
                    together as a school, continue our course offerings and train 7,000 people in
                    leadership. Like most Civil Service people, they had plenty of experience of a
                    Foreign Service Officer coming in with ambitions to create change for the sake
                    of change and a good performance evaluation. My personal challenge was, on the
                    one hand respect their concerns and on the other hand to encourage movement into
                    the direction I thought LMS could go. It was a very different leadership
                    challenge from the ones that I faced in Nairobi or in Guatemala and it really
                    was a good one because it made me far more reflective about the need to adapt
                    one's own leadership style, to pace oneself and to think carefully about the
                    changes you are asking people to make. The LMS team taught me a lot, especially
                    about pacing.</p>
                <p>It became very clear within the first year that we had a real problem with the
                    Senior Seminar. It had a long and fine tradition of putting 30 people from the
                    interagency through nine months of reflection and fun learning about the U.S. It
                    also consumed a huge amount of resources: four fulltime staff and about a
                    million dollars for nine months, which was too long to keep participants
                    motivated about the experience. Plus, we kept losing our Associate Dean of the
                    Seminar to “real” jobs in the Department.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: And do real work.</p>

                <p>BUSHNELL: As much as Colin Powell appreciated trainineven long term traininhe
                    hated the Senior Seminar. He wanted it shut down and the sooner it was, the
                    happier he would be. I was told by the Under Secretary of Management shortly
                    after my arrival that the Secretary was very displeased with the Seminar. The
                    Director General at the time, who had been the head of FSI, had very different
                    views. For me, the issue came to a head when, for the third time in two years,
                    the Chair of the Seminar was plucked for another job. The FSI executive office
                    agreed we would see the final year of the Seminar to its completion, then do
                    away with it. We had, after all, been ordered to create a capstone seminar
                    mandatory for all newly promoted senior officerthe same pool from which
                    Seminarians were chosen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain the origin of “capstone.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think it's the term applied to the training provided newly promoted
                    flag officers in the military — when the training turns from a focus on leading
                    good soldiers to understanding how the world of politics, the world of
                    Washington, the world of senior leadership works. Powell wanted a civilian
                    counterpart.</p>
                <p>Some of the people who created the capstone were the same who worked with me on
                    the Foreign Affairs Leadership Seminar in the '80's. I had decided to eliminate
                    that program in favor of the capstone as well. The end of the Senior Seminar and
                    the FALS course generated a fair amount of controversy. I could understand the
                    consternation — I had enjoyed the Senior Seminar and had helped create FALS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that, being objective, when I looked at my
                        Senior Seminar time I found it fun. I had a great time. And actually did
                        something that was professionally good. I peeled off one of the trips and
                        called on foreign consular officers and then wrote an article. Actually it's
                        the only article I think ever written on foreign consuls. So this was
                        professionally enhancing but I have to say, it's a hell of an adjustment for
                        15 people. I think three or four had already been to War College and they
                        were put in it as sort of a parking place. I think one or two retired
                        shortly thereafter. But I wonder if you could talk about firestorms in a
                        teacup because you had some very powerful people who were very much beholden
                        to the idea of the Seminar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Actually, I was surprised that we didn't get more push-back. The Senior
                    Seminar Alumni Association had heard the rumblings that Powell didn't like the
                    Seminar for about a year, but they hadn't come up with counter arguments. In the
                    end, they rightly complained that the rug was pulled out from under them because
                    the final decision was made so quickly. From my vantage, that decision had to be
                    made quickly because we were just about to start identifying people for the
                    following year. I was sorry that it had to happen that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>I was also sympathetic to some of their arguments. The one that I was most
                    endorsed and really wanted to replicate was the interaction of people from the
                    different agencies. It makes a big difference when you actually know the people
                    sitting across the table in policy discussions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The National Defense University doesn't really do that.
                        It's so dominantly military. Others come in and they bring their stuff but
                        the Senior Seminar was the one place where the mix was not dominantly
                        military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. You can become very close over the course of the program and
                    it's a wonderful thing - and useful to your effectiveness at senior levels. I
                    recognized that we needed to replace that aspect. I also knew we needed to find
                    a way to bring the quality and caliber of speakers to senior grade people. I
                    tried to see if there was a way we could replicate the Seminar on a three month
                    basis or a six month basis but I kept running into fiscal and transfer cycle
                    realities. We could not afford to put people on per diem for long periods of
                    time, nor keep them from their jobs for that long. So, there you are. We made
                    lots of people unhappy. That said, I knew we had made the right decision when I
                    looked at the expense of the Seminar against the number of people who had gone
                    through the Seminar in the 46 years it was in existence — around 640 Department
                    of State officials. Given that the Leadership and Management School was going to
                    be training 7,000 people in the on-coming four years, resources had to be
                    realigned. Ultimately, Colin Powell received a letter of protest about the
                    demise but I never saw the backlash that I had anticipated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe break this down in components. At the 03 or major
                        level, we talk about leadership, what are we talking about? How do you train
                        somebody to be a leader? In the military you're trained in command, learn
                        command voice and how to do drills and expect obedience. There's a whole
                        system that they can tap into. But we're a bunch of pipe smoking
                        intellectual types or something, a little hard to get that type of thing
                        going in our particular society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The notion of leadership has changed dramatically in my lifetime and
                    therefore yours. When I was a little girl I never could have dreamed of being a
                    leader because the notion at the time was that you were either a born leader or
                    you were noit was not something that could be taught. Plus, with rare exception,
                    leaders were men. The leaders engaged with people from the top down, keeping a
                    distance to maintain a certain aura, had access to information that others
                    didn't, and were deemed to have all of the answers. They would make the
                    decisions for everyone else to implement. In return, they were given the
                    attention, resources and respect from below.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>With technological changes, new demographics in the workplace, globalization,
                    specialization and a host of other differences in our world, new concepts of
                    leadership have emerged. Among them is the notion that a number of leadership
                    behaviors can be learned. Also, that leadership means motivating and enabling
                    others to go in a certain direction. The effective leader leverages team's
                    efforts toward an accomplishment, rather than going it alone. This is a
                    different notion of leadership.</p>
                <p>The way we think about people has also changed. We used to think that people
                    needed to be prodded and closely supervised to perform well. We have learned
                    that people actually like to work and achieve, that many are self motivated to
                    do a good job. With the right skills like listening and engaging effectively,
                    developing trust and the right environment, a synergy can be created between
                    team and leader that can accomplish great things.</p>
                <p>Our training reflected these views, as well as the notion that good leadership
                    begins with self-knowledge. So we adapted training that went from the inside
                    out. Some people declared this touchy-feely as if understanding your own values
                    is out of line. I'd tell people that if they didn't care how they touched people
                    or understood how others felt, they had no business aspiring to leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always noticed, it might go back to an earlier era, that
                        I could, listen to inspirational lectures and walk out feeling good and the
                        next day I would have forgotten just about everything. How do you train this
                        sort of thing? I guess things are different now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Lectures are not effective teaching tools. Adults are not empty vessels
                    into whom you pour wisdom. Adults learn by applying their own experience to
                    whatever the issue is at hand. LMS trainers learned quickly that they only had
                    to devote a few minutes to theory then they could get on with application. Not
                    that application was always popular— it is so much easier to talk about
                    something, as you do with case studies, than it is to practice a new skill. Our
                    bottom line was to make a difference in the workplace.</p>
                <p>The Powell team wanted to change the State Department culture through training. I
                    once heard the Deputy Secretary, Rich Armitage, explain to a group that he twice
                    turned down the offer to work at State because, in his experience, it was such a
                    nasty place. I had heard many colleagues echo that over the yearthe culture and
                    its systems did not value people. That was certainly something I experienced
                    before and after the East Africa bombings. If there was anyone enthusiastic
                    about embedding concepts of leadership into our organization it was I.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>The LMS staff began in 2002 conversations about how we could train logistically
                    7,000 people in the time we had and moved into discussions over time about
                    culture change. Are we making culture change? How are we making culture change?
                    When do you get to the tipping point? Have we done it? Is this a different
                    organization from the one that Colin Powell walked into?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that in doing this, that people with other
                        experiences were a different breed of cat from the old Foreign Service —,
                        which was essentially somebody out of grad school. Back in my era, we were
                        all male, we had military. Not that we were military minded, we just did it
                        and then got over it. People today are different, much more computer
                        literate, maybe more touchy-feely. They hug! We don't hug! I mean things of
                        this nature. You find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: There's been a lot of discussion about the differences in generationhow
                    Gen X and Gen Y are different from the Baby Boomers. And you're the generation
                    before mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I contributed to the Baby Boom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: To answer your question, yes, the people recruited into State today are
                    very different. Some of the people come out of the military, others are coming
                    from private sector careers and some are still coming from right out of college.
                    But wherever they come from, they are a very different group of people.</p>
                <p>Let me give an example. In 2000, 2001, something like that the Director General
                    made the decision that as of a certain date, the entering Foreign Service
                    Officers who could prove the requisite salary history would be brought in at the
                    highest step of the grade for which they were hired, rather than the lowest
                    step. This was in response to complaints about low starting salaries. Within
                    weeks people who had completed the A-100 orientation classes that same year
                    became organized through e-mail to pressure a retroactive decision. A-100
                    classes had not only stayed in touch within class, they organized with others,
                    from Baku and Kathmandu. We never did that. Nor would we have considered
                    demanding a shift in policy decisions. Three to six months later, the Director
                    General made the pay retroactive.</p>
                <p>Here's another example. Entry-level officers began hosting conferences. I heard
                    deputy chiefs of mission complain, “It's not fair! The junior officers are
                    having conferences and we're not!” No one had ever said they couldn't, they just
                    never took the initiative! The different attitudes are going to create a far
                    more diverse workplace.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you evaluate or see the results of your mandatory
                        training? Was the idea that at almost each step as you reach major,
                        lieutenant colonel, colonel, level you go through the equivalent of
                        something of this training, that you would bring something more in and do it
                        again but at a more complex level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The first level, Basic Leadership, introduced participants to a range
                    of skills, many of them supervisory and management. Intermediate Leadership
                    broadened the scope of skills and deepened the depth of examination. Advanced
                    Leadership went into even greater breadth and depth, all based on performance
                    competencies. In other words, participants would learn and practice those skills
                    necessary to perform well in the jobs or grade levels they occupied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how do you bring your trainers up to snuff? Are they
                        getting feedback? Do you have a system of getting together with the trainers
                        to talk about their experiences and what they could add on? Because I assume
                        that there was a training process going on both ways, wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yes, the trainers would get together and look at the curriculum, review
                    participants' evaluations and see how things were going. They were also getting
                    feedback from HR and others in the workplace. Plus, I initiated monthly brown
                    bag lunches with all of the trainers. Inevitably issues would just pop uwomen
                    trainers, for example, experienced many more challenges than our male trainers.
                    Everyone experienced a certain degree of initial cynicism about the
                    training.</p>
                <p>What was new to participants was a 360 evaluation. Everybody, from Basic,
                    Intermediate, and Advanced Leadership through the Senior Executive Threshold
                    Seminar, the capstone course, was given the opportunity to have peers, bosses
                    and subordinates anonymously answer questions about performance and impact. So
                    you would get a 360 assessment of yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about 360 degrees around</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: In terms of the people around you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Viewpoints, yeah, go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You would receive an assessment of your skill in areas like handling
                    conflict, motivating people, I can't think of all of the areas. This was the
                    basis of the training for both the trainers and the participants. If you see
                    that everybody agrees you're pretty lousy in a certain area, if you've got any
                    sense at all you're going to pay particular attention to that area when it comes
                    up in the training. We've been doing these 360 assessments for years and have
                    developed a good sense of the high and low marks of the Department as a
                    collective.</p>
                <p>The issue of whether the training has made a difference is one of the most
                    difficult issues we faced because there are so many variables. It's very hard to
                    assess the impact of training separate from everything else that affects a
                    person.</p>
                <p>We did get some type of feedback. In 2002 and again in 2004, the Office of
                    Personnel Management did a satisfaction survey of all government personnel
                    across agencies. The survey asked the same questions about supervisors, tools
                    required for the job, etc. One of the questions was something like: “I think my
                    supervisor does a good job.” In 2002, the Department's ranking was 26 in a field
                    of 29 agencies. In 2004 we moved up to fifth. That is stunning! The difference,
                    I think, showed two things. I'd like to think the training was part of it, that
                    our training for supervisors was taking hold. And I also think that the impact
                    of Colin Powell and his attention to leadership at all levels made a palpable
                    difference. I'll be very interested to look at future results to see if we
                    maintain our upward trend or if we dip. We'll see.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern about a type that we have in the Foreign
                        Service? Particularly in our business, if you just produce good managers,
                        you got a problem. We have to have people who are beyond managers, who think
                        ahead, whither China today, or whither Russia or what have you and who add
                        that intellectual element that's vital to a sound foreign policy
                        development. They're loners. Some have made ambassador by sheer brilliance
                        but never supervised anybody, often aren't very good mission leaders but at
                        the same time add something that sort of a good manager might not add to the
                        intellectual development of a policy towards a country.</hi>

                <p>BUSHNELL: That is the business of the Department of State, isn't it — to
                    influence matters of policy? If you are not focusing on policy issues you're in
                    the wrong business. The mistake we have made is to separate policy from
                    leadership, as if they are different. We need to shift our either/or thinking.
                    The definition of good leadership in our business should be the design and
                    implementation of effective strategic policies leveraging the resourceincluding
                    peoplat hand. It is a mistake to evaluate leadership and policy separately,
                    which we still do. If you're going to be effective in the senior ranks you have
                    to be both. That doesn't mean you can't think lofty, strategic thoughts in your
                    windowless office and contribute to policy discussions but to be effective you
                    also have to interact with people, listen to what they have to say and take
                    their views into consideration when making policy. They could be right! I think,
                    at least I hope, that the amount of tolerance we have for senior people who are
                    brilliant and abusive has shrunk. The world has become far too complex to be
                    ruled or even explained by a single person, however smart he thinks he is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at leadership, did you find people coming back and
                        saying, “Hey, I've just been out there and so or so or my boss doesn't meet
                        the criteria of this, this, this and this, creating all this
                        discontent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We sure ditime after time. On one occasion, an entry-level, A-100
                    orientation class complained to the Deputy Secretary about the cynicism of
                    participants of the Deputy Chiefs of Mission seminar. At a joint social function
                    the DCMs allegedly told entry-level people, “Just you wait! You think things are
                    great now, just wait 'til you've been in this organization. You'll see how awful
                    things are and how you get screwed by the system” etc., etc. The Deputy
                    Secretary called everyone of the DCMs at the seminar to give them a piece of his
                    mind, reminding them that if you don't want to be a leader, then step out and if
                    you do, straighten up and fly right! Senior people became careful of their
                    language very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm probably stating a bias but we've just finished a very
                        peculiar four years, the first four years of the Bush Administration, which
                        from my historical point of view probably is the depths of American foreign,
                        I mean, it's the pits in American foreign policy. The only comparable thing
                        I can think of is 1807 when Jefferson and Madison cooked up the embargo and
                        stopped all traffic with Europe, practically destroying American shipping. I
                        mean it's really been awful. As far as the attitude, many people, our
                        friends as well as our enemies, have a load of ammunition against us. Yet
                        everybody loves Colin Powell and you've attested to this. And I'd like to
                        know, what sort of reaction were you getting from the junior class,
                        particularly, because they can't help but pick up the bile that is felt in
                        the intellectual circles in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I found concern. I served as mentor to one of these A-100 classes, and
                    they had a lot of questions about the Iraq war and what we were doing. Now this
                    was before Abu Ghraib.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the scandal about how we were treating Iraqi
                        prisoners — the capstone of our disillusionment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: But the numbers of people applying to the Foreign Service haven't
                    diminished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know they haven't. It's interesting, though, that within
                        the Foreign Service, I talk mainly to retired people who normally come from
                        all political stripes. I've never seen such almost unanimity despairing
                        about what has happened in the last four years. Things can only get
                        better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Well, our diplomats live the policy, explain it, and witness the
                    consequences. When I was growing up in postwar Europe, we lived in a bipolar
                    world. The whole purpose of diplomacy was to win the Cold War and the tools that
                    we had to work with included our military tools, our public diplomacy tools and
                    our influence tools. Diplomacy at senior levels was conducted government to
                    government, among people speaking diplomatic language behind closed doors. Now
                    we are in a world in which you having to practice diplomacy on multiple
                    fronts</p>
                <p>Influencing governments is no longer enough; you have to influence the people as
                    well. You can't promote democracy, as we have, and expect a government to do
                    what we tell it behind a closed door. We have to work with interest groups,
                    NGOs, and the public of a country. Plus, our areas of policy have multiplied, as
                    well. I don't know if you saw today in the Washington Post the article about the
                    State Department hosting a meeting with eighty different countries on avian flu.
                    Such a conference would have been unthinkable when I was young health issues
                    were not part of diplomacy. Now, it is front and center, along with topics like
                    environment, human trafficking, terrorism, energy, HIV/AIDs, etc.</p>
                <p>If you are going to be effective in this complicated new world of ours, people at
                    the top have to be thinking about how to leverage their resources to wield the
                    kinds of influence and make strategic decisions on a huge array of different
                    fronts. In other words, you have to exercise leadership. That is the culture
                    change that the Leadership and Management School was trying to impact and I
                    think that Colin Powell understood it.</p>
                <p>It was my ambition for LMS to provide the space and wherewithal for people to
                    think about the kind of a world we're dealing with and the tools which would
                    allow them to more effectively operate in this world. The question that my
                    colleagues and I have grappled with is this: are we training people for the last
                    century or are we training them for this century and the century to come. If the
                    latter, we need to provide people the kinds of leadership tools that will enable
                    them to be both flexible and confident.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>The crisis management work LMS did is a case in point. Who ever heard of crisis
                    management as a component of traditional diplomacy? Crisis management training
                    began after the bombing of the Beirut embassy in the 1980's. The Inman Report,
                    which examined the attack, strongly recommended that embassies exercise their
                    emergency action plans. For a while there was money to do that. In the 90's,
                    crisis management training went the way of resources — down the drain. After the
                    East Africa bombings in '96, we once again had a surge of attention and
                    resources. Responsibility for the training was put into the Leadership and
                    Management School. We spent a lot of time refining our approach to ensure that
                    focus was on the crises to come, not the crises of the past. In an effort just
                    to become better educated about crises, we conducted the first ever
                    statistically valid survey of the kinds of crises direct hire State Department
                    employees face overseas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can say I had two major earthquakes to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: We wanted to get the evidence underneath the anecdotes. I was actually
                    quite surprised at the reluctance of some of my senior colleagues to conduct it.
                    And I had to really push hard, not at FSI, but at Main State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just bureaucratic “Why do this?” or was there
                        concern for the underlying results that you might end up with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: The reasons were never articulated. Once we overcame the obstacles, we
                    were careful to define our terms and target our audience, which included Foreign
                    Service Nationals, Civil Service people on excursion tours and Foreign Service
                    generalists and specialists. “Crisis” was defined as those crises that are
                    included in the Foreign Affairs Handbook, which is the handbook that deals with
                    emergencies, i.e. terrorism, bombing, hijacking, hostage taking, chem./bio
                    events, natural disaster, draw down evacuation and the like. It did not include
                    things like crime, divorce, traffic accidents or events we could call crises in
                    more normal circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would mob action be included?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Political unrest. And there's a list, so we took that list. Once we
                    identified our audience and defined what we meant by “crisis,” we defined what
                    we meant by “experienced.” And our definition of “experienced” was that you or a
                    member of your nuclear family has personally been involved, or that you have had
                    the responsibility for resolving the crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nuclear family being defined as spouse, children.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right or you have had the responsibility for resolving the crisis. The
                    survey produced a 45% response rate, which is terrific. We learned that 64% of
                    all direct hire Department of State employees have experienced one or more
                    crisis as defined by the Foreign Affairs Handbook. If you take away the Foreign
                    Service Nationals from the equation, the percentage jumps to a little over 67%.
                    If you look at Foreign Service generalists who have been in the service 15 years
                    or more, that percentage arrives at 87%. That is a huge percentage. We are in a
                    dangerous profession that is becoming more dangerous and we need to prepare
                    ourselves. Getting people through dangers requires training and good
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>The data underscored the changes we were making in the Ambassadorial Seminar. It
                    had been contracted out for 18 years and was frankly out of date. So we brought
                    it in-house. With help from a couple of colleagues, I redesigned the training
                    and remained personally involved in its delivery till I left LMS. Needless to
                    say, the emphasis was leadership: thinking strategically, acting intentionally,
                    behaving with integrity and taking care of your people.</p>
                <p>A number of non-career participants in the seminar were shocked when they learned
                    of the extent of their responsibilities and the paucity of their control. We
                    brought the non-career appointees in for a day of orientation before starting
                    the actual seminar. They would arrive very excited at the prestige and honor of
                    becoming an ambassador and, by the end of the first week, begin to manifest real
                    doubts about what they had gotten themselves into. We didn't exaggerate but we
                    didn't hold back on the realities of today's ambassadorial challenges
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that you would have political appointees who
                        were going out to Luxembourg or Switzerland or some place for which they'd
                        paid a lot of money in. The threat was almost minimal. The political
                        appointees for the most part tend to go to safe posts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: There is no such thing as a safe post. Look at London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a recent set of bombings in the London
                        Metro system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Right. Just proved what the crisis survey told us: there is no such
                    thing as a safe place in the world today. Europe is as vulnerable to terrorist
                    attacks or crises as any other place. Africa scored higher on political unrest
                    and Latin America on natural disasters but no place was immune.</p>
                <p>In making the results of the survey known, I made that point at the most senior
                    levels that the Department, especially the Foreign Service, needs to change its
                    self image, as well as the way it takes care of people. I'm sorry to say no one
                    paid much mind. Undersecretaries, career or non-career, were just not
                    interested. People seemed to view me as little more than a Cassandra.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I'd say about being that type of Cassandra, it's
                        going to happen and it'll happen again and again and again, just by going
                        abroad. You're going to have these disasters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: I think that if we don't change our self-image and our image in the
                    eyes of the American public then we will be burying many more of our colleagues.
                    If we don't care enough to say, “Look, members of Congress, you're looking at a
                    profession that is far more dangerous than the military.” When you think of it,
                    only a portion of the military actually sees war and, whether they do or not,
                    the issue of force protection is huge. Contrast that with State. A huge
                    proportion of Foreign Service sees crises that members of the military are never
                    faced with. If we don't look deeply into the eyes of the American people, the
                    American media and the American Congress to help them understand our need for
                    consistent resources and force protection then you're going to have more people
                    die. Until and unless we as an organization start to take responsibility for
                    ourselves, rather than hoping that some political tourist who is coming through,
                    be that tourist Democrat or Republican, then we're setting ourselves up for a
                    lot of hurt and pain in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we're going through a particularly bad patch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: This has nothing to do with our political masters, nothing. This has to
                    do with us, the career people. The stewardship of our organization has been left
                    to flounder. I see almost no sense of responsibility for stewardship among my
                    senior career colleagues, except those directly involved in management. If you
                    recall, Colin Powell arrived in 2000 to stacks of reports from within and
                    without the Department of State that essentially said, “Welcome! The ship of
                    State is sinking!” And Colin Powell plugged us up, brought us to the surface,
                    and got us the resources. Before he even left the Department the mantra became,
                    “Oh my God! What are we going to do when the Secretary leaves? Oh my God, I hope
                    the new Secretary will take care of us! Oh, my God, oh my God!”</p>
                <p>To expect political people in senior positions to implement short-term
                    presidential agendas to assume the responsibility of taking care of our
                    organization and our people, is to be hopelessly na�ve, to say nothing of
                    abdicating leadership responsibility.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One reason for doing this oral history is that people do
                        not look back. It's a “me” organization, how can I move ahead? What's the
                        job at hand?</hi>

                <p>BUSHNELL: I do think things are changing. I don't want to leave on a negative.
                    The people who are soon moving up are a different breed of people, at least I
                    hope they are. When I looked at the difference between the people coming through
                    the Deputy Chief of Mission Seminar, 1986 to '89 in contrast to 2002 to 2005, I
                    see an extraordinary shift in attitude and mindset. This gets to your question
                    about diversity. There used to be a lot of cynicism about diversity and people
                    started out hating the mandatory diversity course. Now, we have actually added a
                    second course that is not mandatory and people are still signing up because
                    there's a growing recognition that these are management skills that are
                    essential if you're going to run an effective workplace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so and also I think there was a feeling as it went
                        through its first stages that these are essentially advocates of give better
                        jobs to African-Americans. There were African-Americans on the TV course and
                        all. You're talking to a white body who is a bit reluctant to get that
                        message.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Yeah, I know, people don't like to share power, which is a different
                    conversation. I think that we have in the Department of State a collection of
                    hugely patriotic people who have joined because they want to make a difference.
                    We sometimes mask it with cynicism but underneath it we really care. That's why
                    we joined and that's why we ask our families to put up with very difficult
                    circumstances sometimes. They do because they care, too. Doing a good job and
                    making a difference in today's world is far more complicated than it used to be
                    and far more dangerous than it used to be.</p>
                <p>The whole point of leadership, and why I have such passion about it, is to make
                    it easier for the people who want to make a difference to do so. Without
                    leadership, we will still attract smart and committed people but they will end
                    up doing a job with one hand tied behind their back. It's the loosening of the
                    hands that my job was all about these last three years .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pru, I've done oral histories which cover from, basically
                        from 1945 on. In that time, our people abroad, and the United States are
                        leaders in just about everything you can think about. It's often the U.S.
                        ambassador on the ground who, as you've mentioned can, say, “I was out there
                        pushing the president to be better on civil rights or this or that or get
                        him to face up to AIDS.” Whereas most of our diplomatic colleagues from
                        other countries, in most circumstances and I emphasize most, not all because
                        there are great exceptions, are essentially passive observers. They will
                        join with us if we're willing to take the leadership but the leadership
                        seems to fit the American personality. Also, because of our strength, we
                        seem to be carrying the banner on an awful lot of things all over the world.
                        If we weren't there the world would be a quite different place. So in a way
                        you're training world leaders. Did you have that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>BUSHNELL: Absolutely. Often, if we don't do it doesn't get done. And the question
                    for a senior leader is how do I do it? I can race around the world or a
                    particular a country and spend all my time having bilateral meetings. Or I can
                    engage my entire team to be influencing at different levels. And today, when so
                    many people question what the U.S. is doing, it is the people overseas outside
                    of senior ranks who are helping us retain our place and relationships. The
                    elected and appointed senior levels of government come and go. The steadfast
                    relationship is maintained by career people that allow us to withstand the
                    storms and hopefully temporary setbacks.</p>
                <p>So there you are. I had a wonderful career. I believed strongly in what I did and
                    I have no regrets in leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's been a fascinating career and the thing I've
                        appreciated is that you have a management approach or a leadership approach,
                        leadership is probably the better term, how things work rather than “I did
                        this, I did that” and talking about the system. I want to thank you very
                        much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BUSHNELL: You're welcome.</p>
