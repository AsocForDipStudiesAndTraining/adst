                <p>Interviewer: Morris Weisz </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 2, 1994</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Morris Weisz and this is the first side of the
                        first tape of my interview with my old friend Jack Barbash in Madison,
                        Wisconsin, on May 2 [and 3], 1994. Jack has had extensive experience in a
                        number of fields that are very relevant to our Labor Diplomacy Oral History
                        Project and we will append biographical and bibliographical material to the
                        interview when it is finally transcribed, but in the meanwhile, let me just
                        say that on the domestic front Jack was active in the trade union movement
                        before he entered Federal Government service in 1939. Prior to that, he had
                        been employed in the State Government of New York and spent a number of
                        years in the Federal Government before again going to work for one of the
                        trade unions. He had worked for the trade unions in New York, and in Chicago
                        in 1948-1950, where he was Education Director of the Amalgamated Meatcutters
                        Union for a couple of years before returning to Washington and Government
                        work with the United States Senate. Ultimately he ended up at the C.I.O. and
                        in 1957 in a big change in his occupation he entered academe on a regular
                        basis. Before 1957, he had been teaching occasionally in various schools and
                        especially at the Workers School at the University of Wisconsin. As a result
                        in 1957 the University of Wisconsin offered him a position and ever since
                        then he has been associated with that university. The combination of
                        teaching experience in workers' schools, both while he was working for trade
                        unions and doing extension work, and his work as a teacher led to his
                        interest in international affairs. Beginning with the mid-1950s, I would
                        say, he became a regular among the academics interested in international
                        affairs. In that connection he later visited over 50 countries, usually
                        lecturing for the USIA or the embassy or some cooperating local
                        organization. He traveled extensively and for the purposes of our project I
                        am interested in interviewing him on a number of subjects related to two
                        areas. One, any comments he may have as to the labor officer function in the
                        various government agencies under whose auspices — or even independently —
                        he lectured abroad and secondly, some topics that I have listed that he will
                        have some comments on — I hope extensive comments on — which are related to
                        international labor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, I am going to stop this, and we'll put Jack on with some questions I'll be
                    raising. Well, Jack, suppose we begin. Possibly you might want to correct some
                    of the aspects of your background that I described if you wish at this
                    point.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, my one minute biography divides my career, like all Gaul, into
                    three parts. I have been a trade union economist, a government civil servant,
                    and for 37 years or so a professor, but in certain senses all of these roles
                    interacted, because I was teaching when I was a trade unionist and so although I
                    had different job titles, as I look back, there's a remarkable consistency in
                    what I was doing and what I was interested in. I got into trade unions quite
                    naturally, without conscious choice. I grew up in a trade union household. My
                    father was a Jewish immigrant from Russia, who was deeply interested in social
                    affairs and was himself active on the East Side [of New York City] in some of
                    the intellectual activities like the Educational Alliance, where he was a kind
                    of a manager. The Educational Alliance was physically close by the Jewish Daily
                    Forward, so he was very much a part of that milieu without himself being an
                    active intellectual participant, which he was not. He was a working man, and his
                    career was that of a manager of small time movie houses, which were then
                    breaking through. He had come to the country at the end of the 19th Century, in
                    the 1890s, and moved naturally to the East Side, and then to East New York, to
                    the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, which was almost as great a hotbed of
                    intellectual, Yiddish-socialist activity. I grew up naturally, you might say,
                    within the socialists in the trade union movement. I went to college at New York
                    University and very soon afterwards began teaching classes for various unions
                    around the city and in the metropolitan area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You refer to yourself as having worked as an economist for
                        the trade unions and you did have your degree in economics, but it was more
                        than just being an economist for the unions. You actually did much more than
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Oh, yes. I did much more than that, but my primary job was as an
                    economist and I would say as a teacher. If I go into details, my first job, if
                    it was a job, was on the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and it was on the
                    WPA's Workers Education Program, which was a program to teach classes and write
                    memoranda for trade unions. It was a cooperative program where many of the
                    people later active as union educational directors and research directors served
                    their apprenticeship for such unions as the Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and
                    the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. By the time I was in my very early 20s, maybe
                    even late teens, I was doing work for unions by way of volunteer organizing, so
                    I grew up in such an environment. The difference, I suppose, between me and
                    other people was that I pursued it in what would then be a rigorous fashion
                    intellectually, as I took courses in it, began to write very early about it, and
                    so evolved into the trade union movement without any conscious choice of
                    occupation or profession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the WPA projects, which I had forgotten about. . .
                        That actually was your first employment, although I should remind you that
                        many times you used to refer to your first employment as selling food up and
                        down the aisles in your father's movie theaters. That was employment
                        also.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, it was. I served as an usher in movie houses. Because of my father
                    and my job, I worked my way through college serving as an usher and assistant
                    manager in small movie houses. I rose to the rank of corporal in Loew's-State,
                    as my father happened to know Marcus Loew from their immigrant beginnings. They
                    were roughly of the same age and he got me a job there, where at the pinnacle of
                    my career as usher in Loew's-State, I became a corporal, wearing a uniform, in
                    the first balcony, where I had charge over other ushers. I did not stay there
                    very long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a leadership function.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the WPA, you went to work for a union full time, did
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: From the WPA, I went to work for unions. I did part time teaching for
                    the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in the New York metropolitan
                    area at the rate of five dollars a day and ferry expenses, because I worked all
                    over in the metropolitan area. I got to know what the I.L.G. called the “out of
                    town staff” very closely. They were good friends and that period was extremely
                    valuable in getting me right in to the nitty-gritty of organizing, of holding a
                    union together, of running classes for stewards, of getting into the
                    nitty-gritty of union administration at the local level at a time when the union
                    was just starting out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been 1932 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: This would have been even earlier than 1932, because I was still an
                    undergraduate. I remember a Maiden Form local in Paterson and Elizabeth, New
                    Jersey, where I did a good deal of work and made many friends that lasted a life
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go further on this, in connection with your
                        school activities, did you get involved into politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I got involved into socialist politics. I was recruited into “Yipsel”
                    [Young People's Socialist League, the youth group of the Socialist Party, headed
                    by Norman Thomas] in high school by two fellows from my area who became close
                    friends, Harold Luxemburg and George Novak. Luxemburg later became a fairly
                    prosperous labor lawyer and Novak became a labor editor.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that connection, did you at any time in this period or
                        later run for office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I ran for office as a socialist. I ran for state office...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Brooklyn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I ran in Brooklyn, if my recollection serves me right, because we are
                    now talking close to sixty years ago and I ran in the upper West Side because
                    they needed a fill-in candidate for the state senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The upper West Side of New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Of New York City, of Manhattan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were actually active in street corner
                        speaking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, I was active in street corner speeches and for anyone who wants to
                    look at the archives, The New Leader�and The Socialist Call used to run lists of
                    corner speeches and my name frequently appeared in these corner speeches. I knew
                    how to make a street corner speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To continue with your jobs, there was the WPA and your
                        early trade union activity, if you don't consider the W.P.A. as a regular
                        job, since it was. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: It was a regular job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a regular job in the sense that you were getting
                        paid regularly, but they looked upon that as make-work. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: As make-work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . even though people worked hard at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BARBASH: People worked hard, yes. My first WPA job was to teach public speaking
                    to people who were applying for jobs at the 92nd Street Y.M.H.A., where they ran
                    an employment agency. While they were waiting, I ran a course in public speaking
                    and then I taught a course very briefly at the 42nd Street commercial high
                    school, where I taught scenario writing. That was the only thing I could think
                    of in which I might conceivably have had any experience, because my father was a
                    movie manager. Fortunately nobody showed up for the course, so I never had to
                    teach it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both of these instances illustrate the fact that in those
                        days, for people with that political, social orientation, it was not unusual
                        to teach a course, like you did in public speaking, which you had never
                        taken and was just from personal experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: But I was a public speaker and I was a college graduate. I was doing
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nowadays people rarely get into such jobs without some
                        training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right, but I have to say about the W.P.A., I think that, contrary
                    to all of the jokes that have been made about it, it was the life-saver for my
                    generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, for so many people, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: We all went into it, and we learned very valuable lessons from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a sense, it had a similar effect to that in the
                        post-World War II period under the G. I. Bill of Rights. How many people
                        came out of it who would not have ever been writers and actors and many
                        other professions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, that's right. The point I was making was that it wasn't the
                    leaning-on-a-rake. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: . . . because everybody was in the same boat. This was a country that
                    was almost distraught. If capitalism was ever close to being at its end, this
                    was it. This helped create some mood of hopefulness, and of course if you were
                    young and in your 20s, I can't remember having a sense of desperation. We had
                    something to eat and we had what was an interesting job. I look back on those
                    days with great affection. I made most of my friends there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then your next interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: My serious work in the labor movement began with the contacts I made
                    through the Workers Education Project, which was headed by Nelson Cruikshank,
                    who was just a young minister who had had an assignment in New Haven and then
                    made contact with the Workers Education Bureau when this project was set up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Workers Education Bureau of the AFL</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right. And when this project was set up, it was set up in a
                    famous landmark of New York City labor and radical activity, the Labor Temple,
                    which had been headed by a well-known, famous American radical minister A.J.
                    Muste. Muste allowed the Labor Temple to be used as a base. What we did was to
                    go out and offer to run classes for the trade unions. A very valuable
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the approximate date of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: This was from 1933 onward under various auspices, first under the state
                    and then under the Federal Government directed by somebody whom we all came to
                    revere and love. Hilda Smith was the first national director and [it was]
                    financed through the WPA projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Hilda Smith is referred to by other people who
                        have given this sort of interview I should say that is the “Jane” Smith most
                        people refer to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And because Nelson Cruikshank later became very much
                        involved in international affairs, we should identify him as subsequently
                        the AFL nominee to be head of the Marshall Plan Labor Office in Paris many
                        years later. Yes, go ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, Cruikshank and I and our respective families formed a life long
                    friendship which continued into Washington. In fact, he called me from abroad
                    once to take a job in Europe which I foolishly turned down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not foolishly, because ultimately somebody else got it
                        who. . .</hi>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, foolishly from my experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the job that Dave Saposs ultimately had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I don't know what job he was going to offer me, but with a growing
                    family, it seemed just not feasible for me to take it. This was, I think, when
                    we were living in. . . I had just returned from Chicago working for the
                    Meatcutters Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, this would have been around 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: 1949 and 1950, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then it was after that. This was for one of the jobs in
                        the O.E.E.C.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes. I went from the . . . We were on a roller coaster at the WPA One
                    time we were elevated to almost $37 per week, but it was immediately cut back to
                    $15 per week, but it was fun. We lived in the Village and were part of a coterie
                    of people. We had great fun. Chuck Stewart was our neighbor in one of these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stewart was later in the O.E.C.D.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, and we were part of a whole circle, and later on Kitty got a job at
                    the Laundry Workers' Local of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, where we gave Hy
                    Bookbinder a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should interrupt here to say that the Kitty referred to
                        is Jack's wife and they are just about to celebrate their 60th wedding
                        anniversary, which means this would have been shortly after. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: This would have been in the early 1930s, yes. I got to know the Ladies
                    Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union very well and
                    in particular J.B.S. Hardman, who gave me a job in the Educational Department
                    along with Agnes Douty, Agnes Martocci then, and Esther Peterson. We wrote
                    correspondence courses in labor and also began a life long friendship with all
                    of these people, particularly Hardman, who had a great influence on my
                    intellectual development. I did a lot of writing for the Amalgamated. I wrote
                    correspondence courses in American Labor History and in the economics of the
                    laundry industry, and I also wrote for The Advance, the journal of the
                    Amalgamated Clothing Workers. It was one of the great labor newspapers and
                    J.B.S. Hardman, whose real name was Jacob B. Salitsky, . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a European radical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: A European radical who knew Lenin. He was a man born in the late or
                    middle 1880s. It was a great, profound education. In fact, when I wrote my first
                    book in 1948 called, Labor Unions in Action, I credited four people who had a
                    very profound influence on my intellectual development: Fania Cohn, who was the
                    Educational Director of the Ladies Garment Workers Union, with a long, long
                    history going back to the early 1900s; J.B.S. Hardman, the Editor and
                    Educational Director; David Saposs and William Leiserson, whom I had met and
                    worked with. In 1937 or 1938, I took the Federal Civil Service exam for
                    economists and was picked off that list by David Saposs, the Chief Economist of
                    the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before that you were working for the state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Oh, I forgot that chapter. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Luckily I know you, Jack.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I took a Civil Service examination for minimum wage research
                    analysts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a state Civil Service [examination]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That was a New York State [examination], yes. I should even go before
                    that and say that I had very good education in labor at New York University,
                    which boasted of an excellent faculty, then experimenting with the institutional
                    approach to labor problems; that is, instead of looking at labor, as my friend
                    Selig Perlman said, as “an abstract mass in the grip of an abstract force,” my
                    teachers at N.Y.U. were all people who were caught up in the daily work of the
                    unions as consultants, as arbitrators, as investigators, and I had people who
                    made a very profound impact on me in the study of labor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some names here would be good for people wanting to do

                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, among the names were Lois McDonald, who was a pioneer in
                    organizing women workers in the South and made this connection with the
                    Affiliated Schools group. I forget the complete name. Willard Atkins, who wrote
                    a pioneering book with Paul Douglas in the early 1920s called, Labor Attitudes
                    and Problems in which they studied labor problems industry by industry. It was
                    Douglas, Atkins and Harold Lasswell, who became a distinguished social
                    psychologist at Yale. Emmanuel Stein, who was writing factual briefs for labor
                    arbitration cases. Carl Rauschenbush, who was part of a family of social
                    reformers. His father, Herbert Rauschenbush, was the founder of the social
                    gospel in the ministry. He awakened the Christian ministry to the labor problem.
                    His brother Paul was a pioneer in unemployment insurance in Wisconsin.</p>
                <p>I ran into a whole coterie of people at N.Y.U. and I taught at N.Y.U. I became a
                    graduate assistant teaching labor courses and then got a job with the New Deal
                    agency, the Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.), where I wrote my first
                    formal piece of work in 1935, a pamphlet which became widely used. Called
                    Apprenticeship Admittance Requirements in New York City Trade Unions, it listed
                    all of the unions which were offering apprenticeships. It gave me new insight
                    into craft unions, so that by the time I was in my middle 20s. . . I also took a
                    master's degree at N.Y.U. and decided to take as my master's thesis topic the
                    Senate's on-going LaFollette Committee investigation. I was influenced in that
                    by a boy friend of Agnes Martocci's, Eddie Levinson, who was the Labor Editor of
                    the New York Post. Alone Eddie had constituted himself as the precursor of the
                    LaFollette investigation, because he had written an epic work called I Break
                    Strikes as a series of articles for the New York Post. The book turned out to be
                    the life of a strike-breaker by the name of Pearl Bergoff. He always hated his
                    feminine name. Pearl Bergoff was the preeminent tool of the open shop employer
                    in breaking strikes from about 1910 on, if my dates [are correct]. Levinson's
                    book was what opened up the whole question of systematic employer activities,
                    and I decided to. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Systematic employer anti-union activities,
                        strike-breaking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes. I wrote my dissertation on . . . I think it was called, “Employer
                    Attitudes and Methods of the Belligerent Employer” using. . .</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BARBASH: That was my master's thesis. I became so interested that I wrote 350
                    pages for a master's thesis. I remember Kitty sitting up all hours of the night
                    typing it to meet the deadline, but it brought me in contact with the LaFollette
                    Committee and I was present at that famous moment in the LaFollette Committee
                    hearings on the [1937] Chicago Memorial Day massacre when the Fox Movietone
                    movie was shown [with] the strikers being shot in the back by the Republic Steel
                    Police. That little clip from I think it was either Fox Movietone or Paramount
                    News became one of the staples in exposing anti-unionism. I got to meet the
                    staff of the LaFollette Committee. I was doing this through 1935 and 1936. In
                    1937 I finished the thesis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wrote it while you were working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I wrote my thesis while I was working, yes. I was also working and
                    teaching at N.Y.U. As a teaching assistant I taught night courses in labor
                    problems. Kitty and I were living in the Village at the time, so it was no great
                    problem. This period was an exciting time in our lives, and even though the
                    country was in a deep economic depression — Roosevelt had just come in — we
                    didn't know . . . Looking back on it, it was the most gripping time in . . .

                        of Jack Barbash. He is now going through the period of the mid- and
                        late-1930s, and he has mentioned two things on which I want to ask him for
                        some details. One of them is the LaFollette Committee. How it was brought
                        about. What it was doing at this exciting period. Jack, you mentioned that

                        Bergoff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right. I reviewed the book. I forgot to say, but one of my other
                    chores then was that I was a book reviewer for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. It was
                    an inspirational idea of a man by the name of Ed Cushing, who later turned out
                    to be part of a Communist cell. One other person who was there who testified
                    before the Un-American [Activities Committee] was Winston Daniels, who became a
                    C.B.S. correspondent. But the Brooklyn Daily Eagle magazine, you know, . . . I
                    had been a school boy correspondent at both Thomas Jefferson [High School] and
                    N.Y.U., one of my odd jobs, covering sports. I covered college and high school
                    sports for the New York Times . . . — My editor then became a famous columnist,
                    Arthur Dailey, who when I needed to go to my high school prom, lent me five
                    dollars to rent a tuxedo. — . . . and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. I continued as a
                    stringer in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, and I wrote articles for them. I wrote an
                    article on the C.I.O. for them. Jack Herling also did some writing for them
                    through Ed Cushing. I did articles on other labor topics and earned a little
                    money that way. I still have in my scrapbook the article on the C.I.O. and John
                    L. Lewis, in which I made the point that this was more than an academic squabble
                    over craft versus industrial union. It was just a whole new way of looking at
                    things. I was doing lots of side things that were related to labor, but my
                    serious, systematic work was my master's dissertation.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>You were asking me about the LaFollette Committee. I wandered off. I believe it
                    was Levinson's extraordinary work on the New York Post as Labor Editor, one of
                    the early labor editors, and his investigative reporting of Pearl Bergoff that
                    led to the LaFollette Committee investigation, because he opened up that whole
                    new field brilliantly, brilliantly. I got to know Eddie through Agnes. Eddie was
                    Agnes' boyfriend. So I knew about the LaFollette Committee almost from its very
                    origins and followed it, then went to Washington several times to talk to the
                    Committee with an eye perhaps to getting a job, but I never succeeded. Actually
                    the first work I did for the LaFollette Committee was when I got a job at the
                    N.L.R.B., when David Saposs took me off the Civil Service list, and somehow I
                    got assigned, as they say now, seconded [from the N.L.R.B.] to the LaFollette
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll get to the N.L.R.B. later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Now, the origin of the LaFollette Committee itself has been written
                    about, but Senator [Robert M.] LaFollette had quite a Communist problem on the
                    Committee itself, and he became disillusioned with the Communists. There were
                    articles written that he himself may have written about it in the Saturday
                    Evening Post or some such place. My memory is very dim. I seem to think that
                    there was a book written about it by a historian later on by the name of
                    Margolin or Margolis, who wrote about the inside workings of the LaFollette
                    Committee. Nevertheless, the LaFollette Committee did an invaluable job in
                    setting the stage for the kind of anti-labor activities, giving content and
                    depth to some of the language of the National Labor Relations Act, and, before
                    that, Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which formed part of
                    the link and legislative history through which the National Labor Relations Act
                    was formed, and also the Railway Labor Act. All of these constitute part of an
                    evolving legislative history [about] which my memory is too dim, but . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Railway Labor Act, though, was passed even
                        before the Democrats came in, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: The Railway Labor Act came in 1927, and it did deal with some of these
                    unfair labor practices on the railroads. The real author of the Railway Labor
                    Act was a man who later became one of the co-heads of the National Industrial
                    Recovery Administration, Donald Richberg. He was a labor lawyer very close to
                    the railroads and to John L. Lewis, and was connected in the early 1920's to the
                    passage of the Railway Labor Act. . The railroads were able to get the first
                    protective legislation because the railway unions were in a unique position of
                    being a highly organized, well-connected organization in rural areas, where they
                    could reach rural communities. The authorship of the Railway Labor Act, I am
                    trying to remember, was a combination of a populist Congressman. . .</p>

                <p>BARBASH: Well, to get back [to the subject].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the LaFollette Committee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: The LaFollette Committee, despite the internal probings and the emphasis
                    on the industrial unions and that kind of thing, nonetheless historically was a
                    major force in the legislative history of the Wagner Act because the Wagner Act
                    never spelled out its key terms. It never really spelled out “collective
                    bargaining.” In justifying it before the Supreme Court Saposs' Division [of
                    Economic Research, NLRB] and you and others had to go back into the legislative
                    history of collective bargaining and those early [NLRB research] pamphlets were
                    an attempt to spell out that history. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jack, you are referring to the early reports. I would love
                        to take credit, but I didn't get to the NLRB until shortly after [that
                        research helped establish the Act's Constitutionality].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: A group of you, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, but that group under Saposs. . . We'll get into
                        that when Saposs appoints you. There is one thing, because it's important
                        later on, for students of this period, especially those who work in the
                        international field must understand that in the LaFollette Committee, in the
                        CIO, in the NLRB, and in other New Deal Government agencies, Communists were
                        active. They were a force within these agencies, but at that juncture the
                        Communist-anti-Communist conflict had not developed in such a way that these
                        people were thrown out of their jobs; so that at the same time within
                        agencies you could have the fight between the Communists and the
                        anti-Communists, especially among us who were socialists and none of us
                        would have thought that these guys should be kicked out. It was just their
                        political influence that we were worried about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes. The situation was simply this. The CIO erupted and you had what I
                    guess you would call several “centers” that were prepared to function in it. You
                    had the Communists, a well organized group. It was unavoidable that they would
                    move in and that they would be utilized, because they had the organizational
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . and would be useful. We have to say that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BARBASH: You had the Socialist, non-Communist left developing from the Brookwood
                    Labor College stream, who were a very important source of organizational skill.
                    They proved invaluable in that they constituted a source of organizational skill
                    in countering the political significance of the Communists. There are some who
                    hold, I think with some exaggeration, that the Brookwood Labor College was the
                    origin of the CIO, of the non-Communist part of the CIO In any case, Phil Garman
                    wrote a chapter in a book making this point, but the Brookwood Labor College
                    certainly cannot be ignored as having provided a reservoir of skilled people who
                    were schooled in labor organization. The Socialists were a part of that group. .
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . .and A.J.Muste and Dave Saposs, both of whom became
                        important later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, so you had a body of experience that was invaluable. This was also
                    the Popular Front period in Communist labor development in the world wide scene,
                    so the Communists did not seek to isolate themselves and sought alliances and
                    there was common ground here, so that I think from the vantage point of the
                    1990s — from what we know of its later history and historiography — this whole
                    matter of Communist influence has to be understood. I do not, however, want to
                    diminish the importance of the Communist Party itself. There is enough
                    documentation and folk experience, you might say, to indicate that the
                    Communists functioned in the 1930s as an organized group to enhance the position
                    of the Soviet Union within the labor movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the complications here is the fact that during this
                        friendship period of the mid-1930s before the attack of the Germans on the
                        Soviet Union, during that period among those of us who were anti-Communists,
                        we were challenged. These people agreed with us on so many [points], so that
                        there is a complication there, which later on could not exist once Soviets.
                        . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, the Socialists and the group around them were the only ones who saw
                    the long term historical significance of this and made a particular point. It's
                    interesting that some people who became, as you know, Communist hunters were
                    themselves — the striking case was J.B. Matthews — hyper pro-Communists before
                    they turned, but after the passage of time, I think lots of the fellow travelers
                    were not, as I look back on it, the instruments of subversion that they were
                    made out to be. They were young people caught up in the enthusiasms of the
                    moment, and the Communists seemed to fit the romantic stereotype. I take it as a
                    source of my education in the Socialist movement that I myself and my friends
                    were never really caught up in that. I have to say that although we saw it, I
                    think it was mistaken. It was an overkill to deal with the Communists in the
                    manner of [Texas Congressmen Martin] Dies [in the late 1930s] and [Senator
                    Joseph] McCarthy in that way, but that is the subject of another thesis and has
                    been actually. I think in short I would end up this part of it by saying that it
                    may have been counterproductive, because it demonized the Soviet Union,
                    demonized them not in the sense that they were better than they were being
                    described, but demonized them to make them practically omnipotent and paralyzed
                    the democratic forces into believing that this was a hopeless thing, whereas if
                    you pick up a Marxist interpretation, the seeds which ultimately led to the
                    disintegration of the Soviet Union were already to be seen there, and if we had
                    had a more critical stance, which was not dominated by this implacable
                    [overkill] . . . The overkill, I think, weakened the forces given the hindsight
                    that we now have of history.</p>

                    that is you were rated on the basis of your education, experience, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . when the lists came, the list was reviewed by people
                        to find out a couple of things. The pro-Communists influence was so strong —
                        and I agree with you not all of these groups were committed Communists — but
                        their influence was such among the legal staff — and it had its effect on
                        cases at the margin between the AFL and the CIO — they were so powerful in
                        the legal staff that Saposs, the Chief Economist of the Board, who did some
                        brilliant analysis of the economic basis for the Act in connection with lead
                        cases that came before the Supreme Court, Saposs felt that he had to have a
                        staff that was reliably understanding of the political nature of some of the
                        cases that came before us, and frankly he favored people. . . His interview
                        of me was one that resulted from a recommendation made by friends of ours,
                        Socialists, who were already on the staff, and, as I recall, he asked me
                        only one question, “Are you related to the Bessie Weiss, who was my student,
                        at Brookwood?” Well, that was it. You know Brookwood and that connection. .
                        . And in your case, the list came down and well, I must say without looking
                        too carefully when we saw a reliable party. . . I say “we” because this was
                        circulated among the whole group of us before we gave the recommendation to
                        Saposs, and he did know of you. I don't know how.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I think Kitty and I used to check in at Brookwood from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, as I did too, and my sister of course was a student
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: And I think I may have asked him to talk to my Socialist Party branch in
                    Brooklyn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. In any event, it was a familiar name and that's how
                        a few others came in with that sort of reputation. Some of them were not as
                        good in the work of the N.L.R.B. as others, although, as you know, you were
                        one of the popular ones, and I must say the functioning, the quality of the
                        work that was done, was varied. In any event, you were at the N.L.R.B. for
                        three years as I recall.</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's right. 1939 to 1940 and then the division was
                        abolished and some of . . . The accusation was made about the Communists in
                        the NLRB and as it turned out the only one who was discriminated against was
                        one who was an anti-Communist, Dave Saposs, who lost his job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, I went to the Office of Education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In late 1940, as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And stayed there until the war began.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, and then I went to the W.P.B. [War Production Board] to work for
                    Saposs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Saposs by that time had been rehired in the
                        Government and was the head of a staff. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: And I recruited Nat Weinberg and introduced him to the U.A.W. by the
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, I introduced him to Don Montgomery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that you were working in the War Production Board. So
                        your work at the NLRB and subsequently at the War Production Board was
                        really in the domestic field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Completely in the domestic field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: However, you were exposed — and because of your political
                        background I imagine kept in touch with the broader international
                        field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I knew social history in general, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, how did you become involved and interested in the
                        international labor field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Intellectually I became involved because I discovered very clearly in
                    teaching that you couldn't teach or understand labor movements without
                    understanding how other labor movements [function]; that is, the comparative
                    method is absolutely indispensable in understanding your own movement and more
                    so than in any other field that I have inquired into; that is the method of
                    cultural anthropology by which you can't understand your own movement until you
                    understand how it compares to other movements. It turns out to be an absolutely
                    indispensable tool in teaching about our labor movement, although when I started
                    teaching it, I was wrong-headed; that is to say, it was wrong headed in relying
                    on essentially ideological differences between movements without picking up on
                    the essential method of cultural anthropology which doesn't rely only on what
                    people say but what people do. So when I wrote my first book, Labor Unions in
                    Action, I was very conscious of the fact that this difference between
                    revolutionary and pure and simple unionism was in large part based on what
                    people say, not what people do. I admit that in the blush of my first discovery,
                    I went overboard. I later came to modify this to say that what people say does
                    also have a good deal to do with their behavior. That you have to understand
                    that, but purely as a problem of understanding, as a teacher trying to
                    communicate the idea of a labor movement, very early in my intellectual
                    awareness it became quite obvious to me that there is a difference therefore
                    between knowing a subject and trying to communicate the subject. And I suspect
                    that the great shortcoming of American labor leaders and the absence of ideology
                    in American trade unionism was not that an ideology would have led to some
                    difference in practical ends that might have been adopted, but that it did not
                    contribute to an understanding of their own system. I found pure and simple
                    trade unionists very good at running a union but very flawed in explaining the
                    union to others, particularly to foreign trade unionists. That was the biggest
                    failure, I discovered. I'll give you an example. The question of the trade
                    union's relationship to capitalism. It became very clear to me that trade
                    unionism is an institution of capitalism. It is an institution of capitalism
                    because trade unionism subscript one exists only [as a consequence of the
                    development of capitalism.] (End of side B, tape 1)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Morris Weisz and we are now beginning the first
                        side of the second tape of the interview with Jack Barbash. Well, Jack, you
                        were talking about your developing interest in international affairs arising
                        out of a combination of teaching experience, trade union experience, work
                        experience, and how inevitable it was that if one were to understand
                        thoroughly the American labor movement, some degree of comparative interest
                        was necessary.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, it's like cultural anthropology. You don't really develop deep
                    insight into any [labor] movement unless you compare it with others. This is
                    particularly true of the American labor movement which is a deviant labor
                    movement in many respects. Because many practical people within the labor
                    movement didn't understand that or misunderstood it, they created unnecessary
                    friction within the international labor community. The friction arose out of
                    [either] A) [the view] that American business unionism represents the one best
                    way or [B)] the inability to see very common threads between the American labor
                    movement and foreign labor movements due to the inability to conceptualize the
                    labor movement. I don't mean conceptualization in any grand academic manner. I
                    mean in a common sense manner.</p>
                <p>I have a little anecdote about this. When we got a stream of Labor Attach�s here
                    in Madison in the 1960s [studying at the University of Wisconsin], I thought
                    that they ought to understand the American labor movement and so I gave them
                    exercises in studying the American labor movement. When [Ben] Stephansky, who
                    was apparently in charge of this work at one moment in the State Department
                    heard about it, he blew his top. He wanted them to study foreign labor
                    movements. Well, my observation was that the Labor Attach�s were mostly
                    defective in understanding the American labor movement, not in any adversarial
                    way, but in a sense to detect very fundamental, common features, the most
                    [important] of which were [A)] that despite the ideology, movements were working
                    within a capitalist order of different sorts and B) that ideology could be
                    important. It imparted a style to the movements, which all you needed to do was
                    reflect on, to see that there were significant differences in the style of the
                    labor movement to which the foreign labor leaders paid a good deal of attention.
                    Style, although they didn't think it was style, has been very important to
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jack, there was also a misunderstanding on the other side,
                        wasn't there? Namely the feeling of many of the foreign trade unionists —
                        that is European we are speaking about now — a feeling that there is
                        something wrong with the American trade unions. All they thought of was the
                        big buck.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Jack, one of the first things you did that we used so
                        much in Europe — I never saw it published anywhere except in mimeographed
                        form — was [a document in which] you tried to explain this called, “There's
                        More to More than More.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What ever happened to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, it got incorporated into. . . I did it for the Ford
                    Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought you did it because we paid you to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: No, the Ford Foundation first commissioned it in the 1960s. They didn't
                    think much of it, because I didn't denounce more in simplistic terms, but I am
                    glad you remembered it, Murray, because it makes the point precisely that I want
                    to make. Terrible confusion about money [existed] in both directions here.
                    “More” in many instances is simply a method of measurement, not the substance of
                    what you want out of a job. Many people in the quality of work movement both
                    here and abroad took a very snobbish approach to the problem, seeing it solely
                    in terms of money, when it was a much more profound phenomenon going to the
                    heart of what union people demand and on which there wasn't all that much
                    disagreement with management when you got to the core of it. Instead what you
                    had were little hypocrisies about the importance of “more.” I don't want to go
                    into the [details here but] I am glad that you remembered it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we are interested in this concept in the latter
                        respect, not what you did for the Ford Foundation, because the movement for
                        worker participation and all that looked down on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right. They did look down on it. When understood in its context,
                    it was fully consistent with what they were doing and they were all not that
                    much different once you got away from the ideology, but the ideology, I came to
                    learn from my European experience, was very important and could not be ignored,
                    even though analytically you could cut it away to the heart of the argument —
                    that was for purposes of analysis — if you put it down, you see, because it
                    analytically didn't make sense, that was a serious mistake. So what I learned
                    and what I tried to impart to Americans dealing with foreign labor movements was
                    to respect the ideology, because it represented a grand intellectual tradition —
                    Swedes are again the classic case here — and imparted a quality of a movement to
                    the analysis, instead of a business organization. The Swedes spoke like
                    economists analyzing the problem. To be sure, they could afford to do it because
                    they were a majority movement, but also it was a style, an approach, which I
                    admired very much, in their ability to see things whole, whereas a good deal of
                    the cant, which American labor leaders delivered abroad about price control and
                    other things, was pure cant. They did not represent an intellectually
                    respectable analysis, because the truth of the matter, when you came right down
                    to it, they knew better. The European experience led me to distinguish the
                    quality of the labor movement. A movement is a movement, not only whether it was
                    true or not. American trade unionists abroad were very poor representatives
                    mostly, because they kept talking about the labor movement, but never gave it
                    the underlying intellectual quality which you expect of people who participate
                    in a movement. They only knew its history for purposes of debate. The labor
                    movement did education; it did all of these things, a kind of a catechism, which
                    they still bring up, which the President of the Steel Workers makes. When you
                    hear an American labor leader abroad, who does not represent the movement, but
                    can reflect on it intellectually. . . — not that he read a book, but that he had
                    thought about it. That's why I liked Rudy Faupl. He did reflect some
                    intellectuality to the labor movement.</p>

                <p>BARBASH: Yes, he came from here. He was a machinist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . who was a member of the machinists and represented
                        the AFL and AFL-CIO in international work for a long time. He had a
                        wonderful rapport with [foreign] trade unionists.</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BARBASH: It seemed to me on this ground that Walter Reuther was the classic
                    industrial unionist. People put down Walter because of his verbosity and other
                    things in the United States but it seems to me they failed to see the force of
                    Reuther's intellectual leadership, even though it tended to get verbose and
                    never always reflected itself in the quality of the movement that he led. He was
                    not just a talker; he led a labor movement. You could see that in the demands
                    [he made and] in the progress of demands. These were real industrial union
                    demands. The whole conception and the vigor and the energy of the movement was
                    very much like — and that's why they were kindred spirits — [that of] I.G. Metal
                    in Germany, which would be the representative industrial union movement in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, his background, his father having come from
                        Germany. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, but a good deal of it came from native intelligence as he ran the
                    union out of the thought of what it took to run a union in a modern industrial
                    enterprise. The sources of his intellectual strength were the weaknesses in his
                    dealings with fellow unionists, who always thought he was lecturing them. Well,
                    he was, but he was the representative trade unionist in every respect who had
                    the greatest rapport with the European trade unionists, because he represented
                    their language. Well, there was more than words there. He suited the action to
                    the words. The U.A.W. had the best staff work of any union for precisely that
                    reason. The staffers were there not only to put in their footnotes and the most
                    important contribution which Reuther made to the idea of a labor movement was
                    that he related the needs of the movement to the needs of the society and the
                    economy without giving anything away. That is, he was fulfilling the function of
                    an industrial unionist in relation to public policy, and at the same time he
                    didn't give away the immediate interests of the union. He raised the level of
                    debate. He was really the only trade unionist who raised the modern questions,
                    which educated me from my European experience. The book that I wrote, Trade
                    Unions and Economic Policy, although I was naive about many things as I go over
                    the book, nevertheless, made the right point, namely that as a business
                    unionist, you could still operate under capitalism, which is what I mean by
                    “business unionism,” at the same time that you understood the relationship of
                    your policy to the policy of the economy at large. Otto Pragen once had a word
                    of wisdom about this. He said, “The American unionists speak in terms of
                    program. European unionists speak in terms of policy.” These very phrases
                    represent a profound difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Otto Pragen was a former Austrian, who became very active

                    Everybody knows him. He handed out the money.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Put a date [on this]. This was the mid-1950s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Late 1960's. The book came out in 1972. I think I did that in the late
                    1960s called, Trade Unions and National Economic Policy. It started out — my
                    conception of it and you can see how doing it changed my approach — It started
                    out as “trade union involvement in public policy.” I had it pitched only in
                    terms of involvement, but when I actually got there I saw there was more than
                    participation there. There were ranges of difference, ranging from the lobbying
                    activities of the American trade union movement to the running of the
                    government. Now, the Swedes occupy a special place, because I came naively to
                    the Swedes, and although I was intellectually aware, I hadn't absorbed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me raise a question about that. I would put it in my
                        case earlier, because in the early 1950s, this brilliant man who both of us
                        know, G�sta Rehn came to the United States with many of these ideas. Did you
                        meet him at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: He reminded me that we had met actually for the first time in the United
                    States when I started in the Industrial Union Department. He remembered me
                    kindly and generously, because I had been very helpful to him in orienting him.
                    I had no recollection of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the interesting thing is that this brilliant
                        economist G�sta Rehn, whom I worked for later at the O.E.C.D., came to the
                        United States with all these ideas and went back from the United States with
                        the feeling that they were not communicating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, and that was his fault as well as our fault, mostly because we
                    didn't have the bridge of language. For one thing, he lectured us and we got
                    turned off. Precisely the same thing happened to me when I was there. They
                    lectured me. For example, I came to Europe with the notion of apprenticeship
                    that I had developed in doing that first pamphlet in 1935 on restriction of
                    entry. When I put this to the equivalent of an LO [Swedish labor union] business
                    agent he was outraged that I thought of it in such terms and sat me down and
                    lectured me. I listened this time, or the shock effect penetrated into me. As I
                    talked to the Swedish trade unionists, I couldn't at first fathom what they were
                    saying, because what they were saying was so radically different. Well, it took
                    me several months and a year for this notion to sink in. Although I didn't think
                    so [at the time], I was actually a victim of the American model and the
                    verbiage, and in the 1960s, it took the Swedes to set me straight. When they did
                    set me straight in the terms, then I proceeded to move ahead, and they thought
                    so well of the book that they translated it into Swedish, because they saw that
                    I caught what even they hadn't caught, because I was an outsider and was seeing
                    this. Of course Meidner in particular corrected me, because in the first flush,
                    I went overboard on it. I didn't see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Meidner. We should mention the fact that
                        Meidner was the economist for the whole labor movement in Sweden.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Now that came at the beginning of the trip that I took.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's mention the name of the book if somebody wants to
                        read it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: It's called, Trade Unions and National Economic Policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's the first one in which you listed [your wife]
                        Kitty [Barbash] as the joint author.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BARBASH: It may very well be, because she was joint author in a number of the
                    things. But when I finally perfected the title, what I was really saying in that
                    book — and never got around to saying it as effectively as I wanted to — was
                    that the Perlman model was just one among many models of business unionism, as
                    Perlman was willing to say about the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union but
                    never extended it, but you could have the model of business unionism that
                    operated at the level of the macro-economy as well as the micro-economy. What
                    the CIO in a sense, but in full dress the European movements educated me into,
                    was the participation of trade unionism into macro-economic policy without
                    necessarily imperiling the business union function, and when they imperiled the
                    business union function they were democratic enough movements to hear the
                    reverberations from the rank and file. In the case of the Swedes and others, but
                    particularly in the case of the Swedes, when you had the rebellion of
                    overcentralized bargaining the Swedes understood that they had to get back into
                    the shop and to do something about the things that really bothered the people
                    even in a country as small as Sweden where everybody knew everybody else. So you
                    had this process and at the same time you had the trade union movement lecturing
                    the employers that they were not sufficiently advanced technologically. I was
                    puzzled by this until G�sta Rehn illuminated this for me by talking about the
                    significance of a movement that is the majority, that if they played the game
                    like a minority movement they were endangering the interests of their own
                    members. The AFL-CIO could only reflect a minority and they were behaving in a
                    business union model in which there was a minority here. This is why in the
                    readings which I included I had the book by Rehn and Meidner, which I thought
                    was a classic work, because it seemed to me the only trade union exposition of
                    how a labor movement functions at a macro-economic level and lectures its fellow
                    trade union movements on the responsibilities of macro-economic policy which
                    they could only ignore at their peril.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what you are saying, as I understand it, is that
                        competent as a union can be at a micro level, a [simple] combination of
                        unions [cannot] do anything at the macro level unless it appreciates the
                        need to operate at the macro level and requires it..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: And then for many years, I made an enemy, half consciously, of Nat
                    Goldfinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nat Goldfinger was the Research Director of the CIO
                        originally and then the AFL-CIO later.</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BARBASH: I wrote in the manuscript, which I let Nat read, which I thought would
                    be a help to Nat, but I was wrong, that in a certain sense — I didn't say it as
                    crudely as this, but this is what it amounted to and he saw through it — that
                    AFL-CIO was not living up to its responsibilities as a movement in
                    macro-economic policy, because its research functions were limited to a service
                    agency to its unions, which was proper enough. Both the German and the Swedish
                    movements differentiated the research function as between the service function
                    and the critical, objective, economic analysis function that they had to take on
                    this other thing. Nat viewed it I think as a reflection on him, but in a certain
                    sense it was saying that the research function is not being given sufficient
                    importance. Actually the AFL-CIO recognized that itself by setting up that
                    Mishel thing [the Economic Policy Institute]. That's what the Mishel thing is
                    all about. As I once told Larry [Mishel], I am not egotistic enough to believe
                    that my comment led to that, but that was what they were doing precisely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you refer to “the Mishel thing,” you mean an outside
                        as it were economic analysis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right. That you had to have, as I learned from almost every
                    important trade union movement in Western Europe, the Austrian, the German, the
                    Swedish. That you had to have and here I was playing my role of economist.
                    Whatever the shortcomings of the economist were, they were taking a clear-eyed
                    look at some of these things, breaking away from the cant that characterized
                    most trade union descriptions. Even an economist trained in economic analysis .
                    . . — Look at Nat Weinberg, who understood these things, or look at Rudy Oswald.
                    — They were incapable until recently of understanding this. I mean they were
                    spokesmen for a minority movement without the detachment to see that they had to
                    be spokesmen for a minority movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were being paid. They were doing their job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I am sure they were discharging their jobs, but they were trade
                    unionists first and economists later. I was arguing from my Swedish/German
                    [experience of Rehn and Meidner], who were the best economists. Here again, a
                    casual observation awakened me to the importance of it. There is this leading
                    economist of the Swedish who used to be a socialist. His name will come to me.
                    He wrote a pamphlet for the American Economic Association, part of a series
                    “Economics in Sweden.” He singled out Meidner and Rehn as the leading economists
                    of Sweden, if not of Europe, and even though they had this trade union
                    experience, it was that comment about those two that awakened me to the
                    importance of what they were doing. I then read their book in a new light as a
                    statement of a new philosophy. It took me some time to latch on to it. I give
                    you this at length because this was not recognized intuitively either by the
                    Labor Attach�s or by the American trade unionists who went abroad. They did not
                    grasp it. They saw the European movements as deviant movements because of their
                    macro view. . .</p>

                    think the American rank and file was being short-changed by this more than
                    necessary pure and simple unionism, that is to say not meeting the people on

                        they tried to get everything out of their work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Absolutely, but because there were some trade unionists who were capable
                    of understanding, then it is not too great a demand to say that others [can].
                    For example, it is said about Lenin that this was the only way it could be done,
                    but if you know the literature, you would know that there is a whole body of
                    European socialism that condemned it. Rosa Luxemburg in particular — you can
                    point to it — was not the only one. She and Trotsky and a less aberrant
                    movement. Well, if a Walter Reuther is capable of understanding the problem, —
                    what he was saying in his own fumbling, lecturing way that alienated some of the
                    people and their inability to grasp the underlying truth of what he was saying —
                    then others could have been capable and they didn't have the wit to see that
                    they were just as ideologically set in the ways of 1886 as the Europeans were in
                    their way. And they didn't have the wit to see that they could argue with the
                    Europeans on their own turf. Look at the extraordinary performance which the
                    Americans put on the shop floor in protection of interests which the European
                    movements came to [acknowledge] only grudgingly and then through the method of
                    “dual unionism,” a system of unionism for the shop floor and a system of
                    unionism for collective bargaining, which had its points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In different forms. You've actually jumped a little bit
                        ahead of what I want to do. I want to get the basis of your involvement in
                        international labor affairs. You've given it on the economic sense. Then
                        just in the organizational sense, you became involved in various
                        organizations, one of them was the US Government, where the Government sent
                        you all over to lecture and observe. You did the lecturing for the
                        Government and you did the observing for your writing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right, as a matter of fact, I told the USIA that if I was going
                    to do a next book I would dedicate to the USIA</p>

                <p>BARBASH�: Because they educated me in another sense by making it possible for me
                    to go beyond the normal route. I got to talk to European trade unionists. I got
                    to talk to European universities, which I would never have gotten into. Just the
                    logistics of the problem of getting into trade union meetings and into
                    universities was beyond what anybody could do. When I did the [book] Trade
                    Unions and National Economic Policy, to have them arrange it for me. . . I mean
                    all of these things were just. . . and on the whole except for few instances,
                    they did it most graciously. They treated Kitty and me very generously wherever
                    I went and I was extraordinarily grateful to them for providing me opportunities
                    which I would [otherwise] never [ have had] in a million years, because after
                    all I was not a specialist in this area. The way it started was really a ruse by
                    which I could go abroad and do some work there for the first time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It did bother us a little bit that on our first tour in
                        Europe in the Marshall Plan, you never came over from 1952 to 1957. You only
                        became interested later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right. I really was afraid of the whole problem, you see. I would
                    be operating in a strange land and the kids were young. I had that problem. But
                    I kicked myself for it. You are absolutely right. I kicked myself for not having
                    taken advantage even of the Cruikshank offer. What a wonderful adventure that
                    would have been if I had had sense enough, but I freely admit that I was really
                    a country bumpkin in keeping away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you made up for it later on. Mention, if you will,
                        your involvement in the IIRA [International Industrial Relations
                        Association].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, before that I should say chronologically that it was when I
                    learned that the US . . . I guess the whole thing began with Harold Davey, who
                    came to Madison as a student and then . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should mention that for a period of time the US
                        Government , very intelligently, gave people as much as a year off to go to
                        university in the labor field to study labor, and a large number of labor
                        attach�s came to Madison [to the University of Wisconsin], partly because of
                        our background in Madison. They went to other universities too. Harvard was
                        one, but Madison was the one that gave them this exposure. Harold Davey
                        having done this as you said appointed other people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: He appointed other people, but what he did for me was he bugged me to go
                    out and lecture. I refused. I resisted. I haven't said anything about my Latin
                    American experience, but that's another thing. He bugged me and finally when [my
                    son] Fred got that thing in India, he [Harold Davey] knew that he had me, so he
                    worked up a trip for a year in which he got the USIA to schedule me for Europe,
                    the Indian subcontinent, and . . .</p>

                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, and so I took a year off, or was it a semester. I forget. Fred was
                    in India. Louis [Barbash] was already out of school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The three Barbash children are Louis the oldest, Fred now
                        with the Washington Post, and . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: And I went on this long lecture tour which began with you in India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you were somewhere else before. Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Turkey was part of this long trip. I think I must have covered about 15
                    or 20 countries. I went down the whole European continent. I was supposed to go
                    to Iceland but didn't. I started in Sweden and went down to Cyprus and Malta.
                    The thing was so poorly scheduled that I flew from Sweden to Malta in one trip,
                    but the extraordinary opportunity that it provided for a variety of situations,
                    a variety of labor [exposures]. Somewhere in my files there must be reports,
                    because I wrote reports on the Labor Attach�s and all of that kind of thing. The
                    various receptions that I got were just the most extraordinary experience that
                    Kitty and I ever had in this respect. It was, now that I am retracing my steps,
                    the same year that we ran the “Saposs thing” here. That must have been 1966.
                    Yes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came to India. We greeted you down in the south, you
                        will remember, in Madras, and you were coming from Sri Lanka, I thought, or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes, I was coming from Sri Lanka, because we started, for some strange
                    reason, . . It was due to the politics of the situation. We had to swing around
                    and I think we started in Pakistan, and we couldn't fly [directly to India], so
                    we had to go by way of Sri Lanka, then Ceylon. Q: And you came up then north
                    from there to Madras.</p>
                <p>BARBASH: It was several. . . But what happened was that we had the “Saposs
                    thing.”</p>

                <p>BARBASH: I am old enough, however, to forget things. Actually my first European
                    exposure came with the Salzburg Seminar in American studies, which was an effort
                    to expose Europeans to American studies and started I think in a way that Ed
                    Young and Bill Rice were involved. I think they were among the first to see this
                    empty castle, Schloss Leopoldskron, just across from Salzburg, as a possibility
                    and set it up. It is now in close to its 50th year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: 1948. As a representative of the US Government, I was sent on a tour to
                    work with Latin American labor departments in setting up cost of living studies,
                    because I had done this work in the New York State Department of Labor, where I
                    had constructed cost of living studies.</p>

                        aspects, not only of the socialist unions in Europe especially, but of the
                        Catholic unions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, I have comments on that as it relates to the understanding of

                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BARBASH: It seemed to me that Foreign Service Officers were insufficiently
                    exposed to the subtle nuances of ideology, because it is a “frame of mind.” The
                    pragmatic American mind is not sensitive to the ideological overtones in which
                    social policy and economic policy in countries other than the United States is
                    the essence. The phrase “social policy” itself has all kinds of profound
                    meaning. It is not a casual phrase as witness the debate that is going on now on
                    the role of social policy in the new Europe. This is a very important element
                    and it seems to me that the ear and sensibility of Foreign Service people is not
                    sufficiently tuned to that level of discourse. It imparts a philosophic
                    dimension which Americans just don't have, even where they don't ridicule it.
                    But it is the nature of the culture and I think one misses a good deal. For
                    example, this is the criticism which European economists have of American
                    economists, that they are so immersed in the numbers and the technique and the
                    methodology that they cannot see the social consequences. This is even true of
                    the criticism which European employers make of American employers, because in
                    response to your other questions, the chief difference between American
                    management and sophisticated European management is that European management
                    understands the functions and purposes of a union even where they disagree with
                    it. They have a history by which they compare the rule of the labor force by the
                    mob, by the crowd., by the street, which Americans don't have. So they see the
                    purpose of the union as imparting a sense of structure to it.</p>
                <p>This is why American companies, for example I.B.M., which are hostile to unionism
                    in the United States, are able to capture the order which unionism imparts. You
                    have told a few anecdotes about your experience with European management in
                    searching out for an element that can render the workers from something like a
                    disorderly mob, as they could conceivably be in some developed countries, into
                    some structure. The labor force has to be given structure and the union is a way
                    of imparting structure. So European management is willing to sacrifice a few
                    units of management prerogative in order to get some “class to class”
                    discussion. They are able to see class in a constructive sense. If you have a
                    class, you have to have spokesmen. This was very striking to me in the Swedish
                    case. It is not that the Swedes are less diligent in protecting economic
                    interests. It's that they see that industrial relations can frequently get out
                    of hand if there isn't some structure to it and the union and collective
                    bargaining is one way of structuring the work force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sure that you are entirely right. I would just stress
                        one qualification, namely when I.B.M. goes abroad, there is that recognition
                        that the United States doesn't have the unions as a class, whereas there
                        they do, but also the situation in those countries is frequently one in
                        which they couldn't operate otherwise, because in other countries they go
                        and do the same thing [local companies do].</hi>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Okay, I am ready to admit that, but I must turn to the history of US
                    industrial relations in the 1930s and 1940s, when it took a long time and a lot
                    of strikes for modern American employers to accept collective bargaining and the
                    National Labor Relations Act. You know how they struggled against the [National
                    Labor Relations] Act. So it is some act of social intelligence for management to
                    recognize when they had to come to terms and the Swedish movement illustrates
                    that perfectly. That whole accord in 1936 — What was the name of that exotic
                    place where they got together. It begins with an “S.” —</p>

                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was the beginning of the Socialist control of the

                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, I was talking about the differences between managements here and
                    abroad. Ideology is important although not overriding and it seems to me that
                    the education of a Foreign Service Officer also has to consist, in part, in
                    developing this ability to distinguish, to understand intellectual currents. The
                    next remarks, you have to remember, come from somebody like me who has spent the
                    last 60 or 70 percent of his life as a professor. If there is any shortcoming in
                    the Foreign Service Officer which I have observed it is his/her difficulty in
                    thinking at a conceptual rather than an out and out factual level. The facts are
                    very important and are very useful, but it does seem to me, for example, that
                    thinking at a conceptual level is also important, particularly at turning points
                    in developments like now, for example. One has to be able to see tendencies,
                    influences, which are very important. Of course the great seismic development
                    has been the dismemberment of the Soviet Union and how this is affecting other
                    things. It may be that [there are] bureaucratic constraints on the thinking of
                    civil servants, not only Foreign Service Officers.</p>
                <p>I have found the same problems with career civil servants in domestic agencies.
                    The agency that I am most familiar with is the Labor Department. Here were able,
                    competent people, highly adept in their field, but their competence and
                    intelligence stopped short of being able to see the broader ramifications of
                    what they were dealing with. Perhaps that comes from having rather rigorous
                    responsibilities that you have to carry out regularly with no opportunity to
                    think in grander terms.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>On the other hand, I suppose professors liberated from the need to produce
                    specified quantities are rather more generous in thinking conceptually. I am
                    thinking now about the publications of agencies. I think in the labor field it
                    is particularly important to deal conceptually with problems, because so much of
                    the labor movement has an ideological undercurrent in which it is important to
                    be able to be reasonably knowledgeable in philosophy, in ideological tendencies,
                    in intellectual currents. I suppose this is less true now than it was say ten,
                    fifteen, or maybe a quarter of a century ago. It does seem to me that trade
                    unionism in the world is becoming more business like; perhaps this is due to the
                    decline of radical socialist ideological influence in Western Europe. Marxism
                    and the other “isms,” my observation is, do not loom as large as they did when I
                    first began those international trips. Perhaps this is less important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let me draw you out on a couple of things and I'll
                        try not to be defensive. I'm not in the Civil Service any more. Let us look
                        back, and this applies more importantly in labor areas, but it applies to
                        one of the other questions I want to raise with you and that is the training
                        of labor attach�s. Two questions: One, remember 1933 and 1934 when the Labor
                        Department put out a very subjective analysis of company unions under the
                        direction of our friend Dave Saposs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I remember it well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you imagine, today, Civil Servants, people who are not
                        political appointees, being given that scope of authority without being
                        canned immediately for coming to the sort of conclusions that came out of
                        that Government publication saying that this [company unionism] is an evil
                        thing, based on the research facts and something should be done about it? It
                        is not possible today in the political atmosphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, I think it is a function of the times; that is to say, we were in
                    a certain sense in a period of transition when lots of things were said and done
                    and published that would be inconceivable now. Now if you did a study of company
                    unionism, it would be too dangerously close to the discussion of
                    labor-management cooperation, which is very much in vogue, and which are, if you
                    want to think as grandly and conceptually as I have been advocating, what many
                    of the leaders who are otherwise associated with progressive realms of thought —
                    I am thinking of Kochan; I am thinking of Dick Freeman and others — They are
                    talking about a new company unionism. You mentioned to me the President of the
                    American Economic Association, who in 1932 talked about company unionism really
                    being the answer. We are witnessing a reversion to that tendency, if you want to
                    look at it in that way. The analogy is very close. The 1920s was a period of the
                    doldrums for real unionism of the kind we knew and our friend was reflecting
                    that. We are witnessing the same doldrums and the same solution. The only
                    difference between then and now is that the radical option is virtually not
                    heard anymore. All we are hearing is the new company unionism, and “company
                    unionism” is not too harsh a term to apply to this mode of thinking. You might
                    think of what would be said if somebody called this “the new company unionism,”
                    which in fact Schlossberg almost did at the Quebec meeting, you will remember,
                    when Kochan and Bob. . . , the fellow from the University of Chicago, said
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was Katz and somebody else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: So I think it is a function of the times, Murray.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is true, but in order to guide us for the future,
                        does that mean that we have to rely upon only the political appointees to
                        bring in these new imaginative proposals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: It takes all kinds of people to make a world. I think good academics
                    serve this purpose. Interaction with academics. Now I can't say that in point of
                    fact my observation has been that the interaction with academics between say
                    government and unions is higher in the United States than in most countries of
                    comparable development that I have seen. Most professors in universities with
                    very few exceptions are strangers to industrial relations. Most of them will
                    come into it as lawyers. They will not come into it in the course of their
                    academic work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to point you to a comment with respect to the
                        changes in our approaches necessary for the new situation in Eastern Europe
                        on labor issues. Do you have any comments on this? For instance obviously we
                        couldn't have a Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, but what sort of help or
                        participation or communication and exchange would be desirable in the labor
                        field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, I am not sure about that, Murray, because I had the same feeling
                    in Yugoslavia when I spoke there about two or three years ago. The question they
                    came up with was: What kind of trade union organization should they have in
                    Yugoslavia? I resolutely refused to answer the question, because it seemed to me
                    the situation was in such transition that I could only do harm by posing as a
                    person of authority on the subject. Instead, I think the basic problem is that
                    the transition from socialism to capitalism as it is called is so much “up in
                    the air” that we really have to study the signs [and] understand the nature of
                    what's happening.</p>
                <p>Let's take in point the great debate in the socialist countries of the shock
                    treatment versus incrementalism in their economic policy. On one of the PBS
                    programs, Stephen Cohen, this fellow from Princeton, who wrote a biography of
                    Bukharin, assailed in the harshest terms the influence of the American
                    economists, particularly the fellow from Harvard, Sachs, on pushing through
                    capitalist market structures and held him accountable for the uprising. Well,
                    what is the answer? What kind of model does one propose? I think there has to be
                    thinking about it. The question has to be posed, so people are sensitive, but
                    clearly we have no model. The only model we have is the Marxist model of the
                    transition from capitalism to socialism, and of course that was disastrous and
                    repudiated. There may be people in the State Department and elsewhere who are
                    thinking about that, but I don't read about it the papers. Of course, at this
                    stage of my life, I can't claim to be current with the literature, but do you
                    see much discussion of the broader implications of the transition?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the answer is yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: There is a discussion?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is discussion and the new Foreign Service Institute,
                        renamed — with a beautiful campus now — the National Foreign Affairs
                        Training Center, has been doing a whole lot of that I am happy to say, but
                        let me say, I don't see it translated — not yet — into proposals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, I would say. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just continue and say that the problem in the
                        Cohen-Sachs disagreement you raised is the problem between the person who is
                        an expert in a particular country and the person who is an expert in a
                        particular subject. Cohen is a famous Soviet expert. Sachs is a good
                        economist. Whether you agree with everything or not, he's an economist about
                        development, and these two things are passing in the night. The problem is
                        how do you manage. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BARBASH: You may be right, but this is a level of discussion which belongs not in
                    the training institute. If you are going to encourage your Foreign Service
                    Officers to be sensitive, then they have to learn to look at the nuances in the
                    signals that are appearing. It's this kind of conceptual thinking that I
                    referred to earlier, that when you sit down for a briefing with an economic
                    officer or anybody else, they were very good on the facts — and I don't want to
                    discount how helpful that was to somebody who comes in raw into a situation —
                    but it does seem as if part of the training should go beyond facts into
                    sophisticated analysis of the facts. And as you say, somebody has to listen on
                    the other end of the reports to make it worthwhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for your interest, let me send you some of these
                        discussions which do include Foreign Service people. I don't see them
                        translated into action, yet largely because they haven't been tested.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, you have to rummage around. I think the deeper thing that I am
                    talking about here is that the day-to-day technical requirements of the job can
                    be so demanding that the broader issues of how to interpret the facts are
                    neglected. I have read lots of annual reports — That's the first thing that I
                    used to read when I got into a country. — and they were very important recitals.
                    In only a few instances did you get — What I think you were trying to do in your
                    training sessions. — get them to think conceptually and it is a problem of
                    bureaucracy. It is not just that thing alone. You've got the bureaucratic
                    tendency. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you identify a person who is a prospective thinker,
                        analyzer, and weigher of subjective factors. How do you run a company like
                        the State Department and try to identify that quality among people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Very difficult.</p>

                        brightest people from the universities, and yet, as you point out and my
                        observation would uphold, possibly to a lesser degree because I could
                        identify people who are better at that, what do you put into your selection
                        process to get that quality?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: I don't know. All I can tell you is that it is very difficult. In a memo
                    that was passed around in the Department of Economics [at the University of
                    Wisconsin], Lee Hansen bemoaned the worthlessness of the paper which the
                    prospective [Ph.D.] candidate reads as an indicator of his ability to teach.</p>
                <p>

                        that we have had here [at the University of Wisconsin].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: If here you spend a day with a guy and you hear him do his best from his
                    dissertation and the batting average of not giving them tenure is more than
                    half, we are failures at predicting the performance of half the people.</p>

                        they are good teachers. You are examining also with respect to whether . .

                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Research performance, but you know you have a vita; you've got letters
                    of recommendation. It's a very difficult thing. You try for it. The first thing
                    is to be conscious of wanting it, so that you experiment with it. Generally if
                    you know your field, I think talking with a person will indicate [his/her
                    potential]. Examples of some of his college papers might do that. Casual
                    discussion might do that. But I am not sure how you identify it. But at least
                    you have to try to deal with it in positions of this sort [labor attach�s] where
                    you are asking people to be social commentators in the labor movement, and
                    that's why I'm sure you are singling them out for special training, because you
                    have to bring to bear a different order of judgment than when you are seeking
                    other qualities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On some specific subjects, any views you have on the

                        be known about it that might not have been known otherwise years ago? What
                        new developments in the industrial relations field? You have commented on
                        some of that already.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Well, roughly the tendencies are that most of Western Europe and most of
                    the world seem to have played down the importance of socialism and socialist
                    systems. In the fields that I know about, we are turning from socialism to
                    economics. I think economic analysis becomes very important, rather more
                    analytical than even I who claim to be a professional economist have been
                    trained in. That is I think formal economic analysis, not to the idiot extremes
                    to which it [has been taken] . . .</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>BARBASH: . . . in number crunching. But I would say that anybody who wants to be
                    a labor attach� should have had more than an elementary course in economics. He
                    should have had some intermediate [courses] and be able to think [in economic
                    terms]. Here I would take as a model the Scandinavians, who can deal with formal
                    economics in an intelligent way without becoming number crunchers. I noticed by
                    the way in an article in the [Washington] Post they single out Laura Tyson. That
                    she is doing that very well. I know, just to give you practical implications of
                    that, that throughout his life as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors,
                    Walter Heller was bedeviled by the formalists in the economic profession, and
                    that he had a real inferiority complex. I would have put forth Walter for a
                    Nobel Prize, because more than anybody else, he gave meaning to the application
                    of economic analysis to economic policy. But both sides of this balance have to
                    be maintained. You have to have a competent level of economic analysis here,
                    which I do not find often, and I admit that as a defect in my own ability to
                    absorb what's happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that is looked down upon by the current big shots in
                        economic analysis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: What's looked down at?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The qualities that Walter [Heller] had. He was almost a
                        politician. They say it as if it's a dirty word. He was almost a
                        “politician” rather than an economist, whereas the trick is to marry the
                        two.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's the point. I think that he successfully married the two, but the
                    people who manifested the low respect for Heller were not themselves at the very
                    top. They were people who were trying very hard to keep up with the “guild.” My
                    paper that I wrote about the “guild” in “Challenge” is very much in point. I do
                    believe that formal economic analysis does give analytical skills to people
                    which they otherwise might not have, but not to the point where economic theory
                    is carried on as a branch of mathematics. I think the Europeans who criticize
                    the Americans. . . This is why American economics is in the lead in formal
                    economic analysis, but European economists think that we have gone too far in
                    formal economic analysis even though they give us all the Nobel prizes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, who gives the Nobel prizes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: The Swedes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the point. The Swedes give that and therefore. .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BARBASH: But the same Swedes. . . If you look at the economics journals in the
                    Scandinavian countries particularly Sweden, which they have the good sense to
                    print in English, you'll see that there is absolutely nothing like the American
                    journals. The Americans, in order to have a journal accessible to people who
                    understand English in the United States, have had to create a separate journal
                    called, “The Journal of Economic Perspectives.” Only the British persist in the
                    formal economic analysis that we do and they're equally unintelligible. Although
                    the Swedes award the Nobel Prizes to the Americans for highly abstract
                    contributions like proving the law of supply and demand, all the Swedish
                    journals and the German journals that are published in English, [discuss] very
                    practical affairs at a considerable level of sophistication. They don't go in
                    for pure economics for pure economic sake. And it is at that level, I think,
                    that even the economic analysts, who I am usually briefed by in the Embassies,
                    could stand improvement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jack, any comments leading from that to the issue — and
                        how to face it and how to analyze it - of trade unionism as a challenge to
                        the economy or vice versa, the dangers presented by economic policy to trade
                        unionism and how those can lead to an intelligent public policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's a big one. I've thought about it. We are in a stage where labor
                    movements are on the defensive. [It has been a] very long stage. I see no sign
                    of change. I may be like that American Economic Review President. Tomorrow
                    something will happen. Everywhere, not only in the United States, but everywhere
                    even where the union membership figures don't. . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me. Both of us have been trying to get the name of
                        that guy. Was it Barnett or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: It was George Barnett. . Q: Barnett. Right. He was the Head of the
                    American Economic Association in 1932, who predicted the demise of the trade
                    union movement. Barnett. That's it. Okay, go ahead.</p>
                <p>BARBASH: Joel Seidman's major professor. I verified it. . . . and they are
                    playing a defensive game everywhere in the world. The powerful labor movements
                    are everywhere on the defensive against market forces, and it reflects itself
                    politically by the absence of the socialist [influence]. Let's take the
                    established movements in Western Europe. And again Sweden is the case in point.
                    I think it is just the fact that has to be recognized.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any new way that you can see of posing this problem? For
                        instance, when a socialist or pro-labor government gets into power, it
                        immediately has the embarrassment of having to face the trade unions and
                        having to tell them that “we can't give you what you want.” And then there's
                        a change in the government. Now that's particularly important in these
                        countries like Poland, Hungary, etc., where the great revolution takes place
                        and the people who have office then lose office, because they can't give the
                        people anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: Yes. Well, it was like I was framing that response to Maurice Seidland,
                    that he had only taken one variable into account. I don't know how you explain
                    it, but that's the situation. Here again there are two ways of dealing with it.
                    You deal with it when you look at what is supposed to be the successful
                    experience of the four tigers. The secret of their success is their ability to
                    restrain forces which oppose economic development, and that means the working
                    classes. That's the secret of their success. The market is maintained only at
                    the cost of restraining the labor movement to the extent that it exists and the
                    forces by government intervention in the economy. Singapore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Singapore is an example and a threat to democracy, because
                        these governments are not democratic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right. I think it is a matter of skill and how you deal with it.
                    But I do not know how you will escape that fact. The same thing is true in
                    Western Europe. Now there might be an object lesson in what is taking place in
                    Russia and [other Eastern European] countries. B may be superior to A, A being
                    socialism, B being capitalism, and there is no difficulty in proving that as an
                    abstract proposition, but the road from A to B can be very costly indeed and in
                    Eastern Europe the costs associated with the transition at this very moment
                    threaten the objective, and this gives some validity to Stephen Cohen['s
                    argument]. It gives it some justification that the economists who are
                    constitutionally incapable of seeing the social consequences of going from A to
                    B may be [serving us up] a gamble, a reversion to authoritarian, totalitarian
                    forces who want to subsidize. How long can you keep people living at the
                    standard of living which is necessary to refrain from giving subsidies to these
                    inefficient industries that are running rampant and that seem to be problem. I
                    don't know what the answer to that problem is, but it is a serious problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one answer is indicated in today's newspaper, where
                        the World Bank is said to be thinking of large scale investments that will
                        enable them temporarily to breach the gap.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>BARBASH: And Boris Yeltsin's compromises, two steps forward and one step
                    backward; but on the other hand, there are some indications that Poland has. . .
                    From what we know, is there a less oppressive way of going from A to B? I think
                    that is the dominant question for the Socialist systems. For Western Europe, I
                    don't think you have [to worry]. You have a cycle of power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A cycle of power within the democratic system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: That's right. Democracy is not threatened by these things, and I think
                    that the “welfare state” was overreaching itself in the Scandinavian
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they had the internal ability to correct themselves;
                        the conservatives came into power and then they found out that they could
                        not solve these problems, so they go out. But it is the nature of a
                        democratic society that permits such changes..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: There is a very harsh reality which was illuminated by my friend David
                    Granik, now dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Granik died. I didn't know that. He was a Russian
                        expert here in the Economics Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BARBASH: He was a Russian expert, but he was a Russian expert who went into the
                    factory and management. He concluded that the vulnerable aspect of the Soviet
                    system was the right to work, not the right to work in our sense, but the right
                    to a guaranteed job. There are two elements involved in this situation, and
                    that's why Kochan and others are utopians. For most of the jobs around, the
                    system could only work if people have a long run or short run fear of being
                    unemployed. That is, the jobs are so hateful in and of themselves that the kind
                    of work which the system demands can only be carried on by people who are not
                    guaranteed their jobs. As soon as you make the disincentives too weak, as soon
                    as the people don't care how hard they work in the Russian factories, [the
                    system ceases to function efficiently]. He studied this. This is not abstract
                    reasoning. I feared that this was the case, but people left to their own devices
                    [lack incentive]. This is why I say that the cards of the system are stacked
                    against the kind of volunteerism which the human relations school [assumes] and,
                    if you want case number one, [it] is I.B.M., which went in for that, and they
                    still maintain that they guarantee the right to a job.</p>

                <p>BARBASH: I think the welfare state regimes of Scandinavia and Europe were on the
                    right track. They did it gradually, and understandably they overreached
                    themselves, and now they are correcting it. But if you are in a system as
                    extreme in the right to work [as the Soviet system] that made for incredible
                    inefficiency. In the steel mills these guys would go in from the West and look
                    at those clanking chains around the place and there's nothing that they can
                    recover there, and they have to get rid of three-fourths of the labor force. The
                    system just can't stand that kind of imbalance.</p>
