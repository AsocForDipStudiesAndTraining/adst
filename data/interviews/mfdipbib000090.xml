                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This afternoon on February 22, 1996, we have an interview
                        with Philip Birnbaum, who retired from AID in 1983, after 24 years. In fact,
                        today is the day he started with AID. But let's go back before this now,
                        Phil, and hear a little bit about where you are from, your family, your
                        background, your early schooling, and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Family, Early Years, Education and Military Service</p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I was born in Union City, New Jersey, in Hudson County, which was a
                    working-class Democratic stronghold. After about 12 years, we moved to Teaneck,
                    New Jersey, in Bergen County, which was the complete opposite of Hudson County,
                    upper-middle class, and Republican. Teaneck was one of the first cities in the
                    United States to have a professional city manager, who was the father of Paul
                    Volcker, ex-Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. I went to high school in
                    Teaneck, graduated in 1946, and went on to Rutgers University, graduated in
                    1950, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In the fall of 1950, I enrolled in
                    graduate school at Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: In college I did business administration. My father was in business,
                    manufacturing Swiss laces and embroideries. My brother went into the business,
                    and the assumption was that I would join them.</p>
                <p>I would like to point out that my father was an immigrant, who came to the States
                    in 1914 with no money and no English. Given the opportunities in “the new world”
                    and together with very hard work, he and my mother built a small manufacturing
                    firm into a successful business. His experience always remained with me when I
                    was working in developing countries. It brought home the critical importance of
                    an open economy which allows people to develop themselves and contribute to the
                    growth of the economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I got a BBS, a Bachelor of Business Science from Rutgers with some courses in
                    economics. At Columbia, in graduate school I concentrated on economics,
                    particularly public finance and fiscal policy. I did a year at Columbia, and I
                    was notified that I won a Fulbright Scholarship. I'd actually applied for the
                    Fulbright during my last year at Rutgers, but the award came while I was at
                    Columbia. I went to Cambridge University, in England. The Fulbright was for one
                    year, but I decided to stay for two, and do the Economic Tripos Exam, which is a
                    complete concentration in economics. At Cambridge I earned a BA degree, finished
                    my dissertation for my Columbia MA, and at that time one earned a Cambridge MA,
                    automatically five years after graduation. People say if one really wants to
                    succeed in academia, one has to have a Ph.D. So I went on to Harvard's Littauer
                    Center from 1953-55, and specialized in international economics, foreign trade
                    and a cross-section of different economic courses. I received my Ph.D. in
                    1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were those subjects appealing to you? Public finance,
                        international trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: At that time, econometrics and surely development economics were not
                    standard subjects. Basic choices were either micro or macroeconomics. I wasn't
                    interested in micro, and preferred dealing with policy issues: fiscal and
                    monetary policy, and international trade issues. There was a lot of discussion
                    at Cambridge about European economic recovery and the dollar shortage, and
                    international economic problems. After Harvard, I went into the Army in 1955 and
                    served for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I spent two years at Fort Benning as an instructor, in what was called
                    the charm school. The purpose of this school was to improve the quality of
                    instruction at Fort Benning, which is the biggest infantry school in the world,
                    where they train US Army officers (Office Candidate School) and officers from
                    many foreign countries. I helped the instructors do research on field problems
                    and with classroom lecture techniques. I guess I got assigned because somebody
                    saw all those years at university, and felt I must know something about teaching
                    and research. I came out of the army in 1957. I had finished my Ph.D. course
                    work at Harvard, but hadn't written my dissertation. I still had that in front
                    of me, so I decided to take a teaching job, and I was appointed as a lecturer in
                    economics at Columbia University, in the School of General Studies. While I was
                    working on my dissertation, I got fed up with academia, and with the work on the
                    dissertation. I saw a notice on the bulletin board that ICA was recruiting and I
                    set up an interview.</p>
                <p>Joined ICA in 1959</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know what ICA was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Not really. I knew that it was a foreign aid program. I became
                    interested in foreign affairs because I had lived overseas for two years in
                    England, which gave me some exposure to overseas programs; At Harvard my
                    dissertation was on reconciling economic nationalism and the IMF's objectives.
                    The Fund's position is that if a country has budget and balance of payments
                    deficits, it has to make internal adjustments to restore balance in its
                    financial position. The key point in the dissertation was if industrialized
                    countries had large deficits, living beyond their means, they can more easily
                    make the internal adjustments. It is very difficult for developing countries,
                    with very low per capita incomes to cut back. Politically it was going to be
                    very difficult to get developing countries to pursue IMF policies and there
                    would be this constant tension.</p>
                <p>Another reason why I joined ICA was because my wife and I got married two weeks
                    before that, and we thought one way to get away from our respective families was
                    via an overseas assignment. So I was hired in 1959 as an overseas intern. I
                    hadn't finished my dissertation, and my friends at Columbia said it was not a
                    very good idea to take a job in Washington before you finish your dissertation.
                    The road to Washington was strewn with half-finished dissertations. Although ICA
                    wanted me to go overseas almost immediately, I needed another year. ICA agreed,
                    and I stayed in Washington for one year and finished my dissertation. On
                    February 22, 1960, we arrived in Tunisia, which was my first overseas
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Washington for that year, apart
                        from writing your thesis after hours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: In those days we learned about the country programming and about green
                    and blue print, which were the shorthand names for the program documents. There
                    was a training program and I was in the same intern group with Ernie Stern. One
                    of the things we had to do was to develop a country program. We picked Sudan,
                    spent a number of months working out a foreign aid program for Sudan, analyzing
                    its problems, etc. And then I worked on the Ethiopia desk for a while. I was
                    scheduled to go to Ethiopia but an opportunity opened up in Tunisia and I was
                    assigned as Program Economist to Tunisia. During that year in Washington, I
                    worked with Charlie Breecher, Hy Nissenbaum, Marjorie Belcher and many
                    experienced ICA professionals. It was a good introduction to the Agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>One amusing experience I remember was that we had these filing cabinets where you
                    slipped an iron bar down through the pull handles, and then at the top there was
                    a clasp that the bar engaged, and was secured with a padlock that sat on top of
                    each of the filing cabinets. So to close the filing cabinets, you were supposed
                    to put the bar in and lock the padlocks. Well, I was the last one there on a
                    Friday night, and I guess I was feeling sorry for myself. The bars were not in
                    sight; they were someplace in a corner. I went along and just closed all the
                    padlocks without the bars in place and walked out. When I arrived on Monday,
                    naturally there was a security violation. I was worried as to whether there was
                    going to be just one violation, because there were ten filing cabinets with
                    hundreds of classified documents. Fortunately the Marines, or the security
                    people, were very generous and I only received one violation.</p>
                <p>Assignment as Program Economist to Tunisia - 1960</p>
                <p>I went out to Tunisia in February 1960, as the program economist. In 1960,
                    Tunisia had been independent for about four years. Bourguiba was the father of
                    the country. He was a very charismatic leader, who had a very good understanding
                    about the need to modernize the Tunisian society to promote economic and social
                    development. First, he took the women out of the veil and gave them the vote
                    which, for an Islamic country, was extraordinary at that time. Next, Bourguiba
                    changed the traditional way of observing Ramadan in Tunisia. Of course, one
                    couldn't eat or drink during the daylight hours, but once it got dark, not only
                    did one eat and drink, but one carried on singing and dancing, with some cafes
                    open right through the night. So the next day, it was almost impossible for
                    these people to work. Bourguiba insisted that no modern state can really give up
                    30 days of production to observe Ramadan. He insisted that at midnight
                    everything had to be closed down so that people could get a night's sleep and be
                    prepared to work the next day. There were a series of riots when he made this
                    change, but he persevered. There were other important factors fostered by
                    Bourguiba's leadership. Tunisia really had a meritocracy, with a lot of young
                    people in the government. Their ambition was to get further ahead in the
                    government and they were very dedicated. The country was very fortunate, it
                    didn't have a landed aristocracy. They were all the same petite bourgeoisie and
                    basically working toward the same objectives. One talks now about ownership of
                    the program and good governance, both of which were prevalent in Tunisia, and
                    there was really little corruption. Bourguiba's program was called Neo-Destour
                    Socialism, but the program was moderate. It was based on what was called the
                    French radical socialism, which they used to say was red on the outside and
                    white on the inside, like a radish. One minister, Ben Sallah, was much more of
                    an ideologue, and he wanted to set up collective farms, and nationalize many
                    sectors, but Bourguiba just put him out. He had to leave the country. In sum, it
                    was a very good environment to work in and in which to develop an aid
                    program.</p>
                <p>In those days, an AID mission was staffed like a table of organization in the
                    Army, where you had one of each kind of activity. You had an industry officer,
                    an agriculture officer, a labor officer, a training officer, a community
                    development officer, etc., and of course everyone was expected to come up with a
                    project.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>We had the standard assistance program, including technical assistance, and
                    capital projects, as well as a big PL 480 program. In Tunisia, we had one of the
                    first food for work programs. It had started after a flood in 1958, to clean up
                    the mess, and then the program expanded, and by 1961 or 1962, there were almost
                    100,000 people employed in food for work, all over the country, doing terracing
                    and planting trees. Bourguiba, after a while, decided that it wasn't dignified
                    for people to work only for payment in kind. We were paying them with PL 480
                    wheat, and with soybean oil, or cotton seed oil. For people who were
                    underemployed, the ration was enough to support a family, or even an extended
                    family. When Bourguiba decided that payment in kind was not dignified, they
                    reduced payment in kind and give them partial payment in cash. The cash payment
                    was too much of a drain on the budget, so that didn't last very long. This just
                    shows how a program evolves, and then the next thing that happens is that it can
                    get out of hand. Minister Ben Sallah said “Those people didn't realize they were
                    unemployed or underemployed until you (the US) told them so.” Being unemployed
                    became a job description. If you asked somebody what his job was, he wouldn't
                    say he was a farmer, or a ditch digger; he was a ch�meur, the French word for
                    unemployed person. The minute he had that title, he was entitled to the Food for
                    Work program. In the end, it got out of hand, and had to be cut back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director in Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The director, when I first came, was Admiral Strauss, and he was
                    succeeded by D.C. Laverne. We arrived in February 1960 and in November 1960,
                    Kennedy became president. Kennedy changed the agency from ICA to AID, and
                    declared the Decade of Development. Under this program, the US aid program was
                    to concentrate on a small number of countries and hopefully in a ten-year
                    period, consistent with the Rostow take-off theory, a country would be in a
                    position to take off economically. As the program economist, I helped Harry
                    Lennon, the Program Officer, develop a multi-year program for Tunisia. In the
                    Africa region, Nigeria and Tunisia were selected. Tunisia was selected because
                    Bourguiba was a moderate, not only in his economic policies, but in
                    international relations, for example he always took a moderate position on the
                    Middle East problems. We thought Tunisia was a pretty good economic candidate
                    and developed a program which received a $180 million pledge of US assistance
                    for a three year period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a long range assistance strategy situation—is
                        that what they called them? Where you made a multi-year commitment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes. It was a multi-year commitment, a $180 million for three years,
                    which, on a per capita basis put Tunisia in the top ten of all aid recipients in
                    the world. It was an enormous amount of money for a small country. And then
                    there was a question of spending money effectively. In the end, we couldn't
                    commit $180 million in three years. It took more like five or six years, and
                    initially, it wasn't supposed to include PL 480 programs, but the amount was so
                    large it was necessary to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was at that time during the shift from ICA to AID,
                        what was the primary characteristic of a different style? There was
                        obviously a change of policy, and change in administration. How would you
                        characterize what was different about AID compared to ICA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Before the establishment of AID, you had the Development Loan Fund,
                    which handled the capital or major investment projects like the roads, and
                    ports. With the establishment of AID, capital projects and technical assistance
                    operations were integrated, which makes for a better program. Another big change
                    was President Kennedy's support for the Decade of Development, that we were
                    going to make a big effort for accelerating growth in a number of developing
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there another concept of development process? You
                        talked about Walt Rostow's take-off theory. Was that the sort of driving
                        concept?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The very fact that the President was interested in reformulating the US
                    aid program and put his name behind it was very critical. The Peace Corps was
                    started then and there was an emphasis on international relations and American
                    leadership. The Marshall Plan had come to an end and we were talking about
                    development in what got to be called the Third World. We were engaging in major
                    programs for development in Nigeria, India, Korea, Latin America. You had the
                    presidential push behind the AID program with aid levels that were pretty
                    significant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main direction of the Tunisian program? You
                        mentioned a lot of projects, but what were you really trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: One of the things that was very interesting was that the Tunisians
                    wanted to develop a national economic plan. And here was a capitalist country,
                    the United States, telling them that the plan was a good idea; you should have a
                    clear-cut plan of where you want to go. All the time that we were in Tunisia,
                    the French were still there in large number. Very often the US was giving very
                    different advice from the French. I remember some French people saying that the
                    US is encouraging the Tunisians to develop this multi-year national economic
                    plan but they don't have the resources to support it. We were saying that's the
                    basic problem facing poor countries. To develop they really have to live beyond
                    their resources, and that's the purpose of foreign aid: to provide the external
                    resources, so poor countries can increase their standard of living and increase
                    per capita incomes. Tunisia's first national economic plan, I think, was a
                    five-year plan. There were 12 governates or provinces in the country and they
                    decided that the three poorest provinces were going to get most of the
                    resources, because the idea was to bring them up to the standard of the best
                    provinces, which were in northern Tunisia. We stressed the efficient use of
                    resources, pointing out that the standard of living was not all that high in the
                    best provinces. Furthermore, the poor provinces are mostly arid, with little
                    rainfall, so that one won't get much return on any investment of resources. It
                    was a big discussion on getting a better balance in terms of efficient use of
                    resources. But what they did have in that plan, which is interesting, now with
                    all this concern about poverty reduction, was increasing education and health
                    services, low-cost housing, etc. So, if one looks at Tunisia's performance over
                    the last 30 years, I believe in terms of performance in poverty reduction and
                    the provision of basic human services, that it probably rates among the top
                    performing developing countries.</p>
                <p>One could ask how important was foreign aid in helping Tunisia? I'm looking at a
                    perspective of having served there for just three years, but I've been following
                    events in Tunisia since then. All the things we are talking about now as
                    essential for development, was something that they recognized: the idea of
                    leadership, ownership of the program, being concerned about not only a higher
                    rate of growth, but also poverty reduction. They really had the solid basis that
                    you need for foreign aid to be effective. You can give a lot of foreign aid, but
                    if there's a lot of corruption and there's no commitment, then there will be few
                    results. Bourguiba wasn't completely a saint. He had opposition, which he did
                    not tolerate, and some of the opposition were actually assassinated. He ran a
                    single party system for almost 30 years, which is not exactly democratic, but in
                    other ways they had the best country setting for aid to be effective.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>One of the projects I was involved in was the Oued Nebana Dam. Tunisia is an arid
                    country, with only had one river - some people said it wasn't a river, but a
                    stream, which flowed all year round. Bourguiba made up his mind he wanted a
                    multipurpose dam on this river. Despite the fact that there's a school of
                    thought that there was never a multipurpose dam built anywhere in the world
                    which was economically feasible, we went forward in designing this small dam
                    which had a very small power complex, and it was not going to irrigate a large
                    number of hectares. The US Bureau of Land Reclamation staff came out to look at
                    this project and they said if we build this dam, it will be the most expensive
                    acre of water anywhere in the world. We were having these problems trying to get
                    the cost benefit ratio to come out positive. In those days one used an OMB
                    cost/benefit circular that was used in building dams in the American West.
                    Somebody looked at our figures and said “You didn't include recreational
                    benefits.” I said, “What are you talking about?” “Well, you will have a big lake
                    behind this dam, which can be used for boating and water skiing.” I said, “I
                    don't have the guts to put in recreational benefits for these poor peasants.” So
                    we struggled to keep the costs down. There was a big discussion about the
                    construction of irrigation canals, and to keep the price down, we were going to
                    use compressed earth, which if done right, in that kind of climate can last 50
                    or 60 years. The Tunisians said, no, that the canals should be reinforced
                    concrete, which of course would have increased the price significantly. The
                    French advisors favored reinforced concrete because when they ran this country,
                    it was French companies that did all the work; so it was just an internal
                    revenue transfer from the French taxpayers to the French companies. We finally
                    convinced the Tunisians that the dam didn't have to be built like the Roman
                    aqueduct but it would last 50 to 60 years and would cost a great deal less. It
                    was one kind of experience that we were involved in and there were other
                    learning experiences.</p>
                <p>When Tunisia became independent, a lot of the French and Italians left the
                    country. They were the technicians, so there was a terrific shortage of
                    mechanics. AID approached the problem by financing the establishment of a trade
                    or vocational school concentrating on automotive mechanics. It was called Ariana
                    School. We built the building, we brought in the equipment, etc., but the one
                    thing we didn't have control over was the curriculum. The French and Tunisians
                    took over, and we were shocked to see that all the students were going to wear
                    white gowns, and that the curriculum featured physics, chemistry, and very
                    little hands-on work on the engines. We said, “People are waiting for these
                    mechanics to fix broken down tractors.” I remember we made the point that you
                    can go into a garage in America, and a guy can change the points and the spark
                    plugs, and get the engine timing perfect. Then if you said to the mechanic, “Do
                    you understand the principles of the combustion engine” he'll say, “What are you
                    talking about?” The French, said, “Oh, but that's the problem!” We lost out on
                    that one, and they taught the chemistry and the physics, and the first two
                    classes that came out of the school were useless, and people came to complain
                    that obviously these kids had never seen a motor. There were several of those
                    kinds of experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather there were similar issues at the higher education
                        levels, where the French disparaged American degrees, American
                        education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: There was the problem of degree equivalency. The French educated
                    Tunisians would not recognize the degrees that US universities provided at the
                    same standard. It got to the point where they would grudgingly say that a US
                    master's degree was equivalent to a French undergraduate degree. I think a
                    bigger problem, as in many other countries, was that we send people for training
                    and they got good training, but very often, given the low salaries in the
                    government, they went to the private sector or overseas. A lot of people were
                    lost that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the dam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: That's the most important footnote. The dam was built in a most arid,
                    eroded part of Tunisia, near a major city, called Qairouan. When building a dam,
                    one always talks about the possibility of the once in a hundred year flood.
                    Later many years after the dam was built, there was a major flood with some loss
                    of life. They said if the dam wasn't there, a good part of Qairouan would have
                    been washed away with a greater loss of life. So the dam justified itself. But
                    in terms of a pure economic operation, it was a very high cost operation. At one
                    point, we were prepared not to go forward but it was a political decision,
                    Douglas Dillon, the number two man at the State Department at the time, got
                    involved when Bourguiba objected to AID saying we weren't going to finance
                    it.</p>
                <p>That reminds me that at some point my boss, Harry Lennon, who was the program
                    officer, was to be interviewed by a reporter from the New York Times. Something
                    came up, and Harry had to leave the office, so he said, “OKAY, if you meet with
                    the reporter, you should be very alert, because these guys are looking for a
                    story. They don't want the good news, they want something that is news making.”
                    So I described the AID program to the reporter who was about as young as I was.
                    And then he said to me, “Well, what part of the US AID program is politically
                    driven?” I said, “One hundred percent. It's part of our foreign policy which has
                    multiple objectives: political, economic, as well as humanitarian
                    objectives.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think we achieved our political objectives with the
                        support of the AID program? Or were we achieving them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: One political objective was to promote moderation in the Middle East
                    situation and Bourguiba always maintained that position. Another foreign policy
                    objective during the Cold War was to support people who followed our ideology.
                    My next assignment was Algeria, and there was 180 degree difference compared to
                    Tunisia. Algeria was a country that went the Soviet way, while Bourguiba was
                    following a much more moderate policy. Tunisia was a country with which we
                    shared some common ideals and Tunisia was very often a supporter on the U.N.
                    votes which concerned the US So, I believe it was a happy marriage between US
                    political objectives and a development program that had a reasonable impact. At
                    the same time, we were supporting what Tunisians wanted to do and they seemed to
                    be on the right track in terms of having an effective economic and social
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The political objectives and development objectives
                        weren't at cross purposes, which they can be in other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Right. In certain countries especially during the Cold War we supported
                    people who were following inefficient economic policies which were a waste of
                    resources. I believe the things that made the difference in Tunisia, as I
                    reflect on it, is that they understood the importance of people participating in
                    the economy: small business, small farmers, etc. That's the most important thing
                    if you want to get development. A society where everybody can get equal access
                    to foreign exchange and credit and the corruption is pretty minor. Bourguiba
                    also saw the importance of modernization and political participation. He put the
                    emphasis on being modern and always appeared with a suit and a tie, but when he
                    relaxed, he wore a jallabah. But in public appearance, always the modern man. In
                    1956 the women had the vote and in the 60s, they were talking about family
                    planning. There could be open discussion, and there were some small family
                    planning programs. So that, on all accounts, Tunisia was a relatively open
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet with Bourguiba yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: No, I never did. I was too junior. Maybe I met him at a signing
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what kind of impression did your colleagues have of

                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Bourguiba was a first rate leader, a dynamic speaker, and in that part
                    of the world, a speech often lasted two or three hours. Bourguiba attracted
                    young professionals into the government. The young people that we worked with
                    were really quite impressive, well trained, and there was a fairly high rate of
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your contacts in the government were quite dedicated,
                        competent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes. In that sense, Tunisia was a very good place to work, especially
                    for a young person like myself. I remember we came up with a new project, a big
                    range management project. And we went to see the people in the Ministry of
                    Planning, and they said “Ce n'est pas inscrit dans le buget, (It's not in the
                    budget) we have no money for it this year. It will have to wait a year.” It is
                    difficult to tell an AID technician that the project that he's working on has to
                    wait a year. So I had a bright suggestion and said, “How about a little deficit
                    financing?” And they said, “Would you explain what you mean?” I said, “The
                    Central Bank could open up some supplementary credits to the budget, and we
                    could do the project this year.” They said they liked the project, but we'd
                    better go see Mr. Hedi Nouira, the head of the Central Bank. I did go and
                    explained what the problem was; that there was no financing in the budget for
                    this project, and we had to have a contribution from the government. Would the
                    Central Bank be prepared to advance some additional credits to the Government?
                    Mr. Nouira said, “In Arabic there is no word for central banker, so they use the
                    same word as conservative, and the answer to you is no.” So we had to wait a
                    year for that big range management project in the south of Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a very conservative central banker then, for
                        sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes, one worries that introducing people to deficit financing is like
                    introducing people to liquor, who have never had it before, and once they
                    start...so I don't know if it is a good idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the people in the embassy? Did you have much
                        contact with the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: As you can imagine, when we put forward the idea of a $180 million aid
                    program and Tunisia as one of the candidates for the Decade of Development, the
                    Ambassador was very excited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Ambassador Walmsley. We were meeting with him for a while almost every
                    night, to go over drafts and the argumentation in support of the $180 million
                    program. We worked fairly closely with the Embassy. One incident that I remember
                    very well was Senator Ellender's visit to Tunisia. He would come to an embassy
                    and he would sit at the Ambassador's desk, and everybody would be sitting around
                    him. He would ask all the senior people, what their job was. “What do you do
                    here? How many staff do you have?” The economic counselor of the embassy was a
                    Frenchman who was a naturalized American. Here is Ellender saying to him, “What
                    do you do here?” He responded that he was the economic counselor of the Embassy,
                    and he started to describe his functions, and he said, “And one of my functions
                    is to liaison with the AID mission.” And Ellender exploded, saying, “Liaison
                    with AID? What are they, a foreign power?” And he said, “When I get back to
                    Washington there will not be a separate Embassy economic section and a separate
                    AID mission. You people will be one!” Of course, we never heard any more on that
                    issue. I remember all the embassy officers quite clearly. It was a small group,
                    and we worked well together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the relationship with the French, since they
                        were so dominant in the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: You have to have luck in your assignment, that is when you get assigned
                    to a country. The French were very predominant in Tunisia, even after
                    independence. Their culture and language predominated. They had a very large
                    Residence outside of Tunis, in a town called La Marsa, and the Tunisians decided
                    they would widen the road from La Marsa to Tunis. The French Ambassador's garden
                    was astride the road, and he received a notice that his wall was coming down,
                    and he had to give up 20 or 30 feet of his garden to put the road through. The
                    French looked upon the residence as sovereign French territory, and that the
                    Tunisian couldn't unilaterally do this. Anyhow, they did it. The French
                    Ambassador left in a huff, and there was talk about recalling the Tunisian
                    Ambassador from France. The Tunisians said in effect to the French, “Look, we
                    have another powerful friend. And that powerful friend is the United States.”
                    So, we served a purpose for them and it also helped us with implementing our aid
                    program.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>When President Kennedy was elected, Bourguiba was the first head of state to
                    visit Kennedy. And that was a big political plus for them. There was a funny
                    incident about an exchange of gifts. Bourguiba knew that Mrs. Kennedy was a
                    horse-woman. So he made a gift of two thoroughbred Arab horses which were
                    shipped off to the United States. Now the question was, what was an appropriate
                    gift from the US to President Bourguiba? Well, Bourguiba was very friendly with
                    Tito, who had a magnificent yacht, and he used to take Bourguiba up the Adriatic
                    to his magnificent home on one of the islands in the Adriatic. Well, the message
                    went back to Washington that it would be very nice if we could find an old US
                    destroyer escort and have it refurbished into a little yacht for Bourguiba. The
                    answer came back that that was not in the cards, so then another message went
                    back which said, “How about a helicopter?” The message came back, “Well, the
                    helicopter's expense doesn't bother us, but helicopters have to be maintained
                    very carefully, otherwise they are very dangerous, and that would mean that we
                    would have to provide a crew, and that's not in the cards either. So to make a
                    long story short, the official gift from the US government to Bourguiba was an
                    antique banjo clock! And for about a year, all my Tunisian friends said, “What
                    is a banjo clock?” So I think Bourguiba was a little disappointed with the
                    gift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we can come back to more about Tunisia a little
                        later on. Let's move on. What happened after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Well, we were in our second tour in Tunisia when my good friend, who
                    was the Program Officer in Tunisia, Harry Lennon, was transferred to
                    Algeria.</p>
                <p>Move to Algeria in 1963</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: This was in the summer of 1963. Harry said, “I'd like you to come over
                    to Algeria and join us.” And we decided we would go. Actually, Harry took three
                    people from the Tunis Mission, Leo Rasmussen, who was an excellent agricultural
                    technician, and a woman named Joyce Mallinger, who was concerned with public
                    health and education, bilingual; a very capable person. So we were going make
                    this nucleus of a great little AID program in Algeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harry Lennon was the director of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: This was a year after independence. The Algerians were very xenophobic.
                    The first thing they said was, “We're too proud to have an Aid mission, so all
                    of you will have to be part of the embassy.” So I received a commission as a
                    foreign service officer. I was made second secretary of the embassy. They wanted
                    an extremely low profile. So, in effect, Harry was the mission director, but
                    that title could not be used.</p>
                <p>It was really a state of chaos. Once Algeria was declared independent, about 1
                    million French people left within 7 or 8 months. The French not only controlled
                    the whole private sector, they had all the top government positions, and more
                    importantly, they filled all the minor positions. The guy who read the gas meter
                    in the utility company was a Frenchman. The women who worked the switchboard in
                    the telephone company were all French. So the economy just came to a screeching
                    halt.</p>
                <p>Another sign of the chaos — our son was only just about two years old and my wife
                    was pregnant with our second child, who was to be born within two months of our
                    arriving in Algiers, so we were very reluctant to go into a hotel. Harry Lennon
                    said, “Well, don't worry about that, there's plenty of housing.” The standard
                    practice was for the embassy to sign a lease, and then the house came under the
                    protection of the US Embassy, and they would put up a sign in French and Arabic
                    to that effect. But at that time the countryside was overrun by people who
                    fought in the revolution and who had weapons. They had a practice called “bien
                    vacant.” If a piece of property was empty, they just moved in, that was that.
                    Well, that's just what happened to our house rented by the Embassy before we
                    even got to Algiers. Some guy with a machine gun took it over, and the Embassy
                    never got the lease money or its furniture back.</p>
                <p>William Porter was the Ambassador, and Frank Wisner, who is now our Ambassador to
                    India, was a very junior officer in the Embassy. We're talking about 30 years
                    ago. At every staff meeting the Ambassador would say, “Frank, when are you going
                    to get Birnbaum's house back? When are you going to go down to the police
                    station and tell these guys to do their job?” And Frank would say to me, “Phil,
                    you're never going to get that house back. You had better look for another
                    place. The Algerian police are even afraid to go up there.” So that was the
                    situation. Frenchmen, who had sent out their families would go to work in the
                    morning, and when they came home at night, their apartment or their houses would
                    be occupied, and there was nothing they could do, but get on a plane and get
                    out.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The whole situation was completely different from Tunisia. The first thing Ben
                    Bella did was to declare Algeria an Islamic country. All the women were put into
                    veils and no Algerian could be served alcohol in cafes, although
                    pre-independence Algeria was the most open and “Frenchified” country in all of
                    North Africa. Next, they decided their economic model was to be the Soviet
                    model, with very heavy industrialization. They had the gas and oil revenues and
                    they were going to build all these factories. Agriculture was taken for granted.
                    The country was overrun by Russian and East Bloc technicians, and so we were in
                    the minority. Of course, the French were not talking to them, but one very
                    interesting fact was that the oil was treated as an external resource. All the
                    oil and gas earnings were paid into France, and then a percentage was sent back
                    to Algeria. But the French presence disappeared. We also had travel
                    restrictions. You couldn't go 20 miles outside of Algiers without a permit.</p>
                <p>So it was a very tight situation, and the question was what kind of an AID
                    program could we mount there? There were few Algerian technicians, and they were
                    in the process of setting up ministries. You would go to the Ministry, and you
                    would see people typing with one finger, and an Algerian counterpart would
                    complain to you that “I can't get a call through to a town 20 miles down the
                    road. The operators tell me that the phones are broken, but I know she doesn't
                    know which part of the switchboard to plug in to reach the town. The phones are
                    not broken.” It was really unbelievable.</p>
                <p>Transportation had broken down. There were literally people starving to death in
                    one part of Algeria in the Constantine area, where people were eating leaves and
                    berries. In another part of the country there was wheat, but transportation was
                    inoperative. So, we started one of the biggest feeding programs in the world
                    with the CRS, Lutherans, and CARE. About 2 million Algerians were being fed via
                    an enormous PL 480 food program. And we also were trying to start some
                    agricultural projects.</p>
                <p>I remember at a staff meeting Harry Lennon said, “Mr. Ambassador, I really think
                    that Ben Bella doesn't realize how large a feeding program we are running. Not
                    that he has to tell us thank-you, but he ought to be aware of what's going on,
                    and how important this program is, for keeping this country going.” Ambassador
                    Porter was bilingual in French, and was an Arabist, so it wasn't a question of
                    communication. He said, “OKAY, when I see Ben Bella next, I'll make this point.”
                    And it was very interesting, although the Algerians have this love-hate
                    relationship with the French, they always admired French sophistication. And
                    here is Ambassador Porter explaining to Ben Bella how we're providing food for 2
                    million people, including food for work programs in addition to feeding of
                    children and mothers. And all Ben Bella could say was, “Aucune objection.” “I
                    have no objection.”</p>
                <p>We were struggling to get an agricultural program going, with mixed success. My
                    good fortune, I guess, was that I was only in Algeria for a year. Washington in
                    its wisdom decided they had a better job for me in Washington.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But our primary purpose in Algeria was to try to offset
                        the Soviet influence, or what were we there for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: That's a good question. One thing you have to keep in mind was that
                    they had this very bloody struggle for independence from the French. Algerians
                    remembered very well that when President Kennedy was a Senator, he came out in
                    support of Algerian independence. The Algerians at that time were looking to
                    demonstrate to the French that they had friends. For Americans, we felt that
                    this was a very important country, given all those natural resources, and we
                    knew the Soviets were very interested in getting into Algeria. It was part of
                    the cold war syndrome. If we could establish a footing there, perhaps we could
                    influence the government. But our relations went downhill, and they expelled the
                    United States. I don't remember the exact time schedule, sometime in 1965-66
                    when we were represented by the Swiss, as the Algerians just moved more and more
                    toward the Soviet Union. Algeria became one of the most vocal members of the
                    North-South dialogue, heaping criticism on the industrialized countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much relationship with the government at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: We had frequent meetings and we discussed possible projects but it was
                    very hard to get anything off the ground because they just didn't have the staff
                    and there was a lack of an institutional framework. Remember, they were
                    preoccupied with getting the country going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The food distribution program was handled by volunteers
                        from the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Catholic Relief and Lutherans were very well organized and their
                    management of the food for work programs was pretty impressive. The CARE program
                    was not only a feeding program, but CARE-MEDICO tried to get one of the major
                    hospitals running. As I said, I only had a year in Algeria.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The one thing I do remember was, as I said, there was no AID mission, we were all
                    embassy officers. And we had to take turns as duty officer. Everyone says, you
                    always remember where you were when President Kennedy was assassinated. Well,
                    the day that he was assassinated, and I forgot what day of the week it was, I
                    think it was Friday, and I was the duty officer. I was home maybe two hours when
                    my wife answered the phone and said, “It's the Marine Sergeant who wants to talk
                    to you.” And you know how the Marines are very official. And he said, “Is this
                    Mr. Birnbaum I'm speaking to?” And I said, “Yes.” And he said, “Are you the duty
                    officer this week?” And I answered, “Yes,” and was wondering what the hell was
                    this about? And then he said to me, “The President has been shot.” My first
                    reaction was that it was Ben Bella who had been shot, and that didn't surprise
                    me, because he had quite a bit of opposition. I guess the Marine could sense
                    that I wasn't responding. So he said, “Mr. Birnbaum, I don't think you
                    understand. President Kennedy was shot.” And of course, that was a different
                    message.</p>
                <p>What was interesting was that all that week, and maybe for two weeks after that,
                    we'd walk down the main street in Algiers and people would come up to us who
                    didn't speak French or English, and would tell us in Arabic about their remorse.
                    The Kennedy were very popular.</p>
                <p>The Algerians fought a very bloody war of independence. They claim 1 million
                    people were killed. Perhaps that's an exaggeration, but surely a few hundred
                    thousand or more were killed. They were supported in the war by Nasser and by
                    the East bloc countries, because they always made it their business to support
                    revolutionary movements. We were supporting the French. All the equipment that
                    the French Army had — from napalm to fighter bombers were American. If one stood
                    back and said, “Well, what's going to happen if they win the war, and get
                    independence, which way are they going to go?” The chances of the US having a
                    relationship with them were slim. It didn't take much hindsight to see that.
                    They said, “We know who our friends are, who supported us.” This was a war
                    against colonialism, against imperialism, and in their minds, also against
                    capitalism. So I think the die was cast. We made a noble effort, but we couldn't
                    “compete” with their anti-west emotions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was quite a contrast with Tunisia, and how Tunisia got
                        its independence without that kind of struggle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Exactly. When Mendes-France was Prime Minister, France gave Tunisia
                    independence with just a stroke of a pen. In Algeria, the French tried in every
                    way to put down the independence movement. It was Mao Zedong who said that the
                    village acted as a sea to support the guerrillas. Well, the French resettled
                    half a million Algerians. They emptied out the whole eastern part of Algeria
                    because the villagers, either by choice or by force, would support the
                    guerrillas with food and other things. So the French decided they would make
                    this a no man's land. The French tried every method to hold on, because they
                    looked upon Algeria as part of metropolitan France.</p>

                <p>Reassignment to Washington: Africa-Europe Bureau - 1964</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you finished your year in Algeria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I went back to Washington in 1964, and they said, “Well, here's a guy
                    who got us into a $180 million program in Tunisia. We're going to make him the
                    Tunisian desk officer, and he can backstop this program.” And then I was also
                    deputy to the director of the North African Office, Willard Meinecke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Africa-Europe Bureau at that time? Who was
                        the Assistant Administrator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Peter Strauss came in with President Kennedy. And Bob Smith was Deputy
                    Assistant Administrator for the Africa region. I worked on the North African
                    program, moving the money, getting the projects approved. We concentrated on
                    Tunisia, because everything was going downhill in Algeria. Morocco had a very
                    aggressive US Ambassador, Henry Tasker, and he wanted to know how did Tunisia
                    get $180 million program, and is considered such an important country. Why not
                    my country? Sam Adams was the mission director in Morocco, and I made a number
                    of trips out there in the course of backstopping the program. I decided that
                    that would be a very good place to be assigned. I was in Washington from the
                    fall of 1964 until the summer of 1967, and then I was assigned to Morocco as the
                    Deputy Director, and Sam was the Mission Director.</p>
                <p>Deputy Director and Director for USAID Morocco - 1967-1969</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were assigned as the Deputy, and then became the
                        Mission Director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes, because after a year, Sam Adams was appointed Ambassador to Niger,
                    and I was promoted to Mission Director. In Morocco, King Hassan, Hassan II, as
                    he was called, was both the secular leader and the religious leader of the
                    country. He is a direct descendent of Mohammed and every Friday there was an
                    enormous procession to the main mosque in Rabat, with a huge entourage. He was
                    very clever in that sense, because as the religious leader of the country, he
                    really had absolute control. They had a parliament, but it was a rubber stamp.
                    In Morocco, unlike Tunisia, they did have a landed aristocracy. These were the
                    Fez families, and like the 400 families in Pakistan, if you came from a Fez
                    family, you were well connected. They married one another, and all these people
                    surrounded the King. There was a lot of resentment by young people, because it
                    was very hard to get anywhere unless you had these connections.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>An example of the type of problems that existed, the World Bank was building a
                    number of dams and the idea was that once the land was developed, it was to be
                    distributed to the peasants. Then the Bank found out that all the land was
                    bought up by certain generals, certain people, close to the King. The peasants
                    were going to wind up as tenants for the generals who now owned the land.</p>
                <p>We had a relationship with Morocco that went back a very long time to the days of
                    George Washington. There were also US military bases in Morocco. By the time I
                    got there, the big air bases were gone. They had been moved to Spain. But there
                    was still a naval facility in Kenitra, primarily communications facility, and US
                    ships called occasionally. Furthermore, King Hassan was an outspoken
                    anticommunist, so again, it was the cold war, and Morocco was our ally.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget, sometime in 1968, there was a worldwide State Department
                    circular telling Ambassadors that they had to call on the leaders of their
                    respective countries and discuss population growth as a major economic and
                    social problem and recommend family planning. This was a direct message to
                    Ambassadors and Ambassador Tasker knew he had to do his duty. We put some charts
                    together, and we set up a meeting with senior Moroccan officials, which always
                    included a number of generals. Many of the Cabinet people were military people.
                    Tasker made the presentation, and then there was a pause for questions. One
                    general put up his hand and said, “The United States and Morocco are great
                    allies, right? We are both anticommunist, right? Moroccan soldiers were good
                    fighters, during the First World War and the Second World War, right? Then why
                    do you want to keep down the number of Moroccans? You want more soldiers, not
                    less. I don't understand what you're talking about.”</p>
                <p>That was an example that sometimes your message doesn't get across.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we ever present the message to the King?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: To the top people, the Cabinet, but the King wasn't there. Ambassador
                    Tasker did have a very good relationship with the King. It was a one on one
                    relationship. They would walk arm in arm; the King really liked Tasker.
                    Anglo-Saxons don't like to touch, but in the Arab culture you touch. For young
                    men to hold hands and walk together is not unusual. They really got on very
                    well. The King was a very fascinating character. In public he was the
                    traditionalist. While we were there, the King and Queen of the Belgians made a
                    state visit. Because Hassan was a traditionalist, the dinner in honor of the
                    King and Queen of Belgium was for males only. Queen Fabiola was not invited.
                    Now, the Belgian King had to give a return dinner in honor of Hassan at the
                    Belgian Embassy. And the whole town was talking, “Will the Belgians have enough
                    guts to say, Fabiola is coming, because she is the Queen, and Ambassador's wives
                    are also invited.” In the end, it was only males, and Fabiola was not at that
                    dinner. But in the King's private life, he was a golfer, a pilot, a woman
                    chaser; he was very modern. But he knew how to maintain a traditional image.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>In terms of our program there, we had a multifaceted program. We built another
                    big dam, Oued Moulouya Dam. We were involved in a project which I'd like to talk
                    about, the Hassan II Agricultural University. We had a big PL 480 program, and
                    we started the CYMMT wheat program. We brought Norman Borlaug to Morocco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CYMMT being what program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: It was the introduction of a high-yielding wheat variety. In the Far
                    East it was done with irrigation. In Mexico and Turkey, high-yielding variety
                    was grown on rain-fed land. We also had non-project aid, program loans, which
                    now are considered almost a new phenomenon. But I'm talking about in the late
                    1960s, and in India and Nigeria there were program loans.</p>
                <p>There's been a lot of recent discussion about institution building and the proper
                    kind of technical assistance has been debated. I'm very proud of the US support
                    of Hassan II Agricultural University, because it was something that I started.
                    It turned out to be a success because there was a Moroccan, Dr. Becali, who was
                    dedicated to turning what was in effect an agricultural high school into a first
                    class university. This man realized that this was a 20-25 year job. Initially he
                    was not interested in the US support because although he respected our
                    capabilities in the agricultural field, there was the language barrier, and he
                    was French trained. We found out that Minnesota University and Louvain
                    University in Belgium had a working relationship in agriculture sciences and
                    research, which had nothing to do with AID. For a number of years there was an
                    interchange between agricultural professors from Louvain and Minnesota, so that
                    there were a number of people on the Minnesota faculty who spoke French, and
                    could lecture in French. A professor from the agricultural faculty at Minnesota
                    University was visiting Morocco on an AID project and told me about their
                    relationship with Louvain University. I thought this combination could help Dr.
                    Becali in developing his Agricultural University and accordingly I arranged a
                    meeting with Becali.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The people from Minnesota and Louvain, as well as Dr. Becali, recognized, that if
                    you were talking about getting this school up to a level to graduate people with
                    M.A. and Ph.D. degrees, and do decent research, it was going to take 20 years. I
                    wasn't sure Washington was going to buy this. But I said we would sell it in
                    increments. As we were doing in any number of places in the world, we sent
                    Moroccans to be trained at Minnesota and Louvain, and in the meantime professors
                    from Louvain and Minnesota gradually would build up the faculty, the course
                    work, and the research program. I was only in Morocco for two and a half years,
                    so I only saw the beginning of this. But I understand that our support did go on
                    for almost 30 years, and now Hassan II Agricultural University is a university
                    of first class standing and graduates people even at the doctoral level. They
                    are getting students from all over Africa, as well as Moroccans. So, when you
                    ask what lessons did you learn, what makes for success, I believe the most
                    important thing was this Dr. Becali was willing to dedicate his life's work to
                    make this project work. And we were lucky that we had some very capable people
                    from Louvain and Minnesota, who had experience, and had Becali's confidence. So
                    when people talk about institution building, it is important to establish the
                    right time frame. If you are talking about building a university, 15-20 years is
                    the minimum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was one of the most successful of the agricultural
                        university programs that we had around the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I can't take credit for what happened later, but it was an idea that I
                    thought could work. Dr. Becali was very much taken with the American approach to
                    agriculture. That really came home in bold letters, when Norman Borlaug arrived.
                    You know his approach; he got the King involved, and the Prime Minister.
                    Ambassador Tasker made it very clear that this was a very unusual man. Borlaug
                    made his presentation on vertical integration from field trials to mass
                    production. Borlaug brought the varieties they used in Turkey and Mexico, and
                    said, “We'll have about two years of field trials, we'll see how they do. And
                    once we see they are okay, we're going to grow a lot of seed, and then we're
                    going to go out to 50,000 farmers to plant the new seed.” He said to the King,
                    “I want you to fire a cannon the day we start the planting. This is like
                    war.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>What was fascinating was that Morocco had a pretty good agricultural research
                    unit in the Ministry. They were French trained, and maybe even some French
                    staff, and they had a unit that was working on wheat varieties. It seemed that
                    this unit had no connection with what they call “Mise en valeur,” the unit in
                    the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for production. So you had a unit
                    concerned with production, but the people in research looked down on them and
                    never spoke to them. Borlaug's people got to know what was going on, and they
                    discovered that there were two varieties developed in the agriculture research
                    unit in the Ministry, which were better in terms of disease resistance, but had
                    never been put into production. So Borlaug demonstrated his point in spades, how
                    important it was to integrate research, extension and production. So they took
                    off with those two Moroccan varieties, and within three years, they had
                    thousands of farmers growing these high yield varieties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: They started in 1968 while I was there, but the major field plantings
                    were a couple of years later. This is another interesting fallout you get from
                    foreign aid. Borlaug was able to demonstrate the importance of an integrated
                    approach. The people who did the research felt that it wasn't their business to
                    try to transform the work into an operational program. The production people
                    never went around to research people to ask what are you working on; have you
                    got something we could use? Borlaug was quite a breath of fresh air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A good example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: But there are other not so flattering examples. We had a veterinarian
                    assigned to our program to do an artificial insemination program. This fellow
                    was an operator. He said, “They've got a bunch of cows that are like broken down
                    Fords. When I get through with them these cows are going to look like
                    Cadillacs.” There was a lot of publicity, and he provided “the service” in many
                    different villages. The first birthing season came, and the veterinarian looked
                    very glum. He said, “Oh, very bad news, something like 60 percent of the cows
                    had still births because they all have venereal disease.” We started this
                    program without doing a survey of the health of the cows. So this failure had
                    nothing to do with the poor Moroccans. Here was the USAID program with a highly
                    trained technician, who should have known to start a disease control program,
                    before we could start the artificial insemination. Everything is a learning
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talked about having a non-project assistance or
                        program assistance, what was that? Was there a policy discussion related to
                        that, or was it just simply resource transfer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: It was basically a resource transfer in those days. There wasn't much
                    policy discussion. We had the same program in Tunisia, and policy indirectly
                    came into it in terms of efficient use of resources. The question was what to
                    import? The Tunisians wanted oil imports, because their power station was fueled
                    with petroleum. There was still program money left over. German export credits
                    had been provided to set up a little state-owned steel mill in Tunisia. We said,
                    “A steel mill in Tunisia? You don't have iron ore and you don't have coal.”
                    “Well, no, you don't understand. This plant uses steel ingots, which we're going
                    to import, and now all we need is the coking coal, and we can make steel rods
                    for the building trade.” The Tunisians asked for financing the coking coal under
                    this US program loan. We had tied procurement in those days and found out that
                    the freight would be as much as the cost of the coal. The Tunisians said, “Why
                    are you worried about cost? We're going to make the coke available to the plant
                    at no cost.” We replied, “You can't run an economy that way,” and we did not
                    finance the coking coal.</p>
                <p>In Morocco, I remember, we proposed the purchase of certain fertilizers. Under a
                    program loan, the US was competitive, and the ocean freight was manageable. The
                    Minister said, “No, the market here is set; they know where they want to buy the
                    fertilizer. They are not going to buy from a new source.” We said, “We can
                    understand that the private sector is free not to buy US fertilizers, but the
                    government is running a big demonstration fertilizer program, which you are
                    financing with your own foreign exchange. Here you can use an AID loan with
                    40-year money for this demonstration program.” Then we found out that the
                    fertilizer bought by the government was all rigged. It was a big pay-off
                    program. So when we had these discussions on what to buy, we would find out what
                    was going on in the economy. But then there wasn't the idea of adjustment or
                    macroeconomic policy reform programs. It was basically a resource transfer, and
                    the loans were quite small. The Tunisian loan was $10 million. We preferred to
                    do projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Well, I guess the rationale was simple. They said they have this
                    petroleum shortage, and could you help us out?” We backed into those things.
                    However, in India, we were discussing policy issues, for example, they adopted a
                    competitive exchange rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was the program in Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: About $30 million a year. Ambassador Tasker wanted it to be much
                    bigger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mostly technical assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The Oued Moulouya Dam was a big project. That was interesting, because,
                    I “violated” certain AID rules on this project. The US financing of the dam was
                    about $40 million. It was built in the eastern part of Morocco, that bordered on
                    Algeria, in an area that was subject to flash floods. The experts were saying
                    that if Moroccans don't do the proper upstream work in terms of terracing and
                    environmental protection, this dam could be silted up in less than 10 years. So
                    we put a lot of emphasis on this problem, and it was understood that the
                    conservation work would be done by the Moroccan government However, all the
                    reports I was getting said that they weren't doing anything. When I arrived in
                    Morocco in 1967, the construction of the dam was in process. So in a couple of
                    years the irrigated perimeters would have been ready and the silt would be
                    building up. I went to see the Minister of Agriculture. He said, “We don't have
                    the budget resources. I know I have to do this terracing but the Minister of
                    Finance doesn't give me the money.” We had a big PL 480 sales program, which
                    generated local currency counterpart.</p>
                <p>Rather than saying to the Government, let's get together and review your whole
                    budget and the available resources. I worried about the US financed projects. So
                    we allocated PL 480, counterpart funds, earmarked them expressly for the
                    contracting of terracing work. The next problem was, we got the money in the
                    budget, but no contracts were being awarded. They're all piled up. Again, I
                    violated a basic principle of foreign aid. I assigned an AID engineer and an
                    accountant type, and they awarded all the contracts. I still have some pictures
                    when we went up to see the terracing work being done.</p>
                <p>Someone said, “You've done 100 percent financing of the project, both the foreign
                    exchange, and the local currency costs, and you're managing it as well, when the
                    Moroccans should be doing this.”</p>
                <p>If you look at it in retrospect, many donors tried to do that — earmark funds for
                    their project, set up a project management unit, and syphon off the best guys
                    from the government. Everybody is fighting for limited budget resources, rather
                    than saying, “We've all got to sit down with Government, stop fragmenting the
                    budget, and agree on a set of priorities.”</p>
                <p>The King thought he was very smart, in getting four or five dams under
                    construction at the same time. But the problem was that the existing irrigated
                    perimeters were used only at 40 or 50 percent capacity. The King was very
                    clever. He said, “We should build all these dams now, because if we wait 10 or
                    15 years, the cost will be double. I'll catch up on the implementation later.”
                    Tasker did tell the King that General Dynamics, which just built a tire factory
                    in Morocco, had more trained engineers in its corporate system than Morocco
                    planned to train in the next 20 or 30 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The shortage of trained manpower was a major obstacle to development in
                    Morocco. The King was very much interested in these big projects, and he got
                    donors to respond. The Bank, and we responded with the Oued Moulouya Dam. I
                    understand that it is a pretty good irrigation project now. You know it's not
                    the best thing to do — 100 percent financing and taking over functions the
                    recipient country should do — but you don't want to be caught out and have
                    someone say, “This project get screwed up because none of the reclamation work
                    was done.” So one steps into the breech occasionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Moroccans to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The Moroccans at the very top level were very sophisticated, well
                    educated, extremely au courant with all social graces. But then there was a big
                    divide. If you spoke to students, there was a great resentment against the
                    ruling elite. It will be interesting to see if the King's son succeeds him.
                    Hassan took over as a young man, so he's been King for a very long time. He's
                    survived any number of assassination attempts, some people feel he has a charmed
                    life. Now my friends in the World Bank tell me that the Moroccan economy is
                    doing pretty well, but my sense is that they have this underlying tension there.
                    He's kept the fundamentalists under control, but I think there's a lot of
                    resentment because it's really a two-class society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw that when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Oh, yes. It's very evident in student strikes. They used to close the
                    university twice a year, and once it closed for a whole year. The King kept the
                    lid on. Again, I said you have to be lucky when you are assigned to a
                    country.</p>
                <p>A man named Ben Barka was the head of the opposition party. One day Ben Barka was
                    kidnaped off the streets of Paris, and they never found his body. De Gaulle was
                    in charge of France at the time, and the evidence indicated that this was done
                    by the security police of Morocco, in conjunction with the French security
                    police. De Gaulle was outraged and he set up a trial in absentia, for the
                    Minister of Interior of Morocco, and the head of the Moroccan secret police.
                    They were found guilty in France. Well, you can imagine the reaction. The
                    Moroccan Ambassador was withdrawn from Paris, and they kicked out the French
                    Ambassador. The Moroccans were very anxious to show the French that they had a
                    very powerful ally, the United States. It opened up a lot of doors for us in the
                    Government, because they wanted to demonstrate to the French that they had an
                    alternative. So our relationship was very positive and cordial. I could see the
                    Minister of Finance if we had a problem. We had a lot of opportunity to have a
                    dialogue, and in that sense, it wasn't difficult to work there. But still one
                    had a feeling that the opposition is one day going to get to the government. The
                    King maintains control by having this unusual position of being both a religious
                    and a secular leader, and he's a very clever guy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to their family planning program? Did you
                        have one while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: They had a small one. There's always the question of whether Dr.
                    Ravenholt of AID was right — in saying you don't have to worry about the demand
                    side for contraceptives; its just a supply problem. As mission director, we had
                    two or three domestic staff, a maid and a cook, and they would ask my wife where
                    they could get contraceptives, where they could get help. There was an
                    understanding of the problem, and people wanted help, but you couldn't openly
                    buy contraceptives. With regard to our AID efforts in family planning, we went
                    to see the Minister of Health, and were pushing the family planning. He
                    responded, “I don't have a big enough health budget to inoculate more than a
                    quarter of the children in this country for measles and other communicable
                    diseases. And you're telling me that family planning is the most important
                    problem? If you come back with a total health package, where I can do
                    inoculations and other programs as well as family planning, then I'm willing to
                    talk to you. But if you're just saying that family planning is the most
                    important thing, forget it. Besides which, half of my doctors are French
                    Catholics, and they wouldn't do it anyway.” So we made very little progress.</p>
                <p>I was struck by the fact that, very often we go on a single track like family
                    planning when a country has an enormous health problem. You have to develop a
                    balanced program. While I was in Morocco, we didn't have a sector-wide health
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything about, was there any particular
                        development policy or thrust being pushed by Washington while you were
                        there, or did you feel free to operate pretty much within your own
                        judgments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Well, I had a feeling then that it was still the business of a little
                    of everything. We did some family planning, the high-yielding wheat variety, a
                    range management project, and of course some capital projects. We were doing the
                    Oued Moulouya Dam and the rehabilitation of the airport, with the Federal
                    Aviation Authority. So there was a little bit of the Noah's Ark, a little bit of
                    everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about private sector? Were we doing anything about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: In Tunisia in the early 1960s, we hired a “Beltway” firm to identify
                    private investment opportunities. They looked at the ceramic industry and local
                    industries, and they must have written up 20 or 30 potential private
                    investments, at a cost of maybe $150,000, which was big money in those days. We
                    showed them to some private investors, both Tunisians, and a few Americans that
                    were brought over on a mission. And they said, “You wasted your money, because
                    businessmen are interested in what are the possibilities for a good cash flow?
                    How long is it going to take me to get a return on my investment? No such
                    analyses was available in these studies. A bright kid working at the New York
                    Public Library could have prepared the general information or facts in these
                    so-called investment studies. I don't think we generated one investment.</p>
                <p>One only good thing we did was to bring Walker Sisler and Detroit Edison to
                    Morocco. Sisler was the president of Detroit Edison and in World War II he was a
                    brigadier general in charge of helping with the rebuilding all the power plants
                    in Western Europe. Based upon this experience, he wanted to help developing
                    countries. The power generation in Morocco was pretty antiquated. Furthermore,
                    they kept saying that all the industry is concentrated in the Casablanca area,
                    and we'd like to disperse it throughout the country by making power cheaper. But
                    the cheapest power was in Casablanca, and the most expensive power was in the
                    countryside! We brought Walker Sisler to Morocco. He made his people available
                    for no fee. We paid the fare and the per diem. Detroit Edison staff came over a
                    six or eight month period. They improved their maintenance system, the
                    bookkeeping system, and changed the tariff structure. It really was a fantastic
                    thing, because Morocco was getting people who had operational experience, not
                    some general consultant. Some Moroccans went to Detroit Edison. This was not
                    like the “paunch” corps, the retired executives, but involved a whole company
                    which could backstop the technicians they sent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was AID financing any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: There was little AID financing. Ambassador Tasker was good at
                    attracting potential investors. King Ranch people came to Morocco, including its
                    founder, Mr. Kleeberg, who launched Lyndon Johnson's congressional career. King
                    Ranch was interested in starting a large commercial cattle operation in Morocco.
                    They saw a big market for meat in Europe as the standard of living went up. They
                    had big cattle operations in Australia and Argentina. They knew exactly how they
                    wanted to organize themselves. The King was very excited, because it was going
                    involve some of his cattle. I got to know the King Ranch people and went out to
                    see the ranch. I said, “Why don't you give some consideration to running a
                    training center on the ranch, which I think I can get AID to finance? There are
                    many Moroccans who have a goodly number of cattle, but they don't know anything
                    about supplementary feeding and all the other modern methods you use for a
                    commercial operation. You could run a little school here, which would go over
                    very big with the Moroccans and create some goodwill, because a lot of them say,
                    'Oh, the King's made another deal now with these foreigners.'" King Ranch people
                    said, “It's not our business.” We tried to sell it, but we couldn't push a
                    string; they don't want to do it.</p>
                <p>Another private investment project that we got involved with in Morocco was in
                    the Sousse Valley, where in January and February you can grow melons, tomatoes,
                    the works. We knew about Israel growing vegetables and flying them into Europe,
                    especially in the winter. So we said, “You have the Royal Air Maroc airlines,
                    which can fly from Agadir to Paris overnight. These planes are on the ground all
                    night. They could fly up with vegetables and come back with passengers. There
                    was a company that did this in Texas. They would fly lettuce from Texas up to
                    Seattle overnight, with all the seats out as a freight plane. They would deliver
                    the lettuce and then put back the seats and fly passengers down to Texas. We
                    felt the Moroccans could do the same thing. We brought out two Italian
                    Americans, farmers from Florida, who operated very large irrigated farms,
                    growing lettuce and celery on a thousand acres. The Sousse Valley was irrigated
                    farming and the soil and weather conditions were fine. The Americans said, “We
                    want complete control of the land. It's like a factory operation.” The Moroccans
                    were saying, “No, you have to work with all these little farmers.” We spent a
                    lot of time with these American farmers, and it was fascinating to hear how they
                    operate — like a factory. With a tight schedule: pesticides on this day and not
                    a day later and fertilizer on this day. They said we can only do that if we have
                    absolute control. We cannot work with hundreds of small farmers. The King, I
                    believe, realized that because a lot of this land had been taken back from the
                    French, it was unwise to turn it over to some Americans. So the Sousse project
                    never got off the ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>So we were thinking about private investment, some pretty big stuff. Morocco has
                    the potential, and I wonder how much of that they've done since then. In many
                    ways, they were not interested in resource efficiency. They have a big phosphate
                    industry. It's a big money maker. There was the question of financing new
                    equipment. The phosphate company was mainly owned by the government, and they
                    wanted to get export-import credits. Although Europeans, weren't supposed to,
                    they were prepared to give him them mixed credits, because these were big
                    purchases. I remember having a discussion with the Minister of Finance, saying,
                    “This huge company has cash flow and earns substantial profits. It can tap the
                    private capital markets. There are very few enterprises in Morocco which can do
                    that. Why are you wanting to use a limited amount of concessional assistance or
                    export-import credits when you can finance the equipment with private sector
                    capital? Concessional assistance should be used for education and health
                    projects.” But the phosphate company wanted to get the softest money it could
                    get, because they wanted a better bottom line, highest level of profits. One
                    explanation was that the King was one of the largest shareholders in the
                    company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, any other dimensions of Morocco that you want to
                        add?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: It's a long time ago. It was a good assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there two and a half years, you said?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Move to Washington as Deputy Assistant Administrator: Africa Bureau - 1969</p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: We arrived in Morocco in June of '67 and by November '69, I was back in
                    Washington. The reason was that Sam Adams was recalled from Niger by Dr. Hannah,
                    to be the AID Assistant Administrator for Africa, Sam insisted I be his deputy.
                    It was a very fortuitous development, because I was scheduled to go to Vietnam
                    as Economic Counselor of the Embassy, and the Associate USAID Director for
                    Program and Economic Policy. I'd already been informed of that while in Morocco.
                    Ambassador Tasker tried to intervene and said that “He should stay here in
                    Morocco, he's just started a lot of good things.” But the message came back,
                    “No, he's going to Vietnam.” However Sam Adams insisted, and Dr. Hannah wanted
                    to support him, so my going to Vietnam was canceled, and I wound up working with
                    Sam. This was in 1969.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>One incident in Morocco at the end of my tour, that I remember concerning my
                    possible assignment to Vietnam involved Orville Freeman, who was Secretary of
                    Agriculture for a number of years. When we were in Morocco, Freeman was out of
                    the government already, and was heading up a private agricultural consulting
                    firm. Freeman sent a message saying that he would like a series of meetings with
                    government officials, and with private people to discuss potential agricultural
                    projects. So I arranged it, and then we had a big luncheon at my residence.
                    After everybody left, we had another cup of coffee, and Joan, my wife, joined
                    us. Freeman said he made good contacts. He said, as Secretary of Agriculture,
                    “Whenever I traveled I didn't have to do anything. Everything was arranged for
                    me. Now I have to stand in line with my passport.” How different the world was.
                    Then he said, “But you've got a pretty good life here. It's a lovely house. You
                    obviously have a good cook; that was a delicious meal and a very lovely garden.”
                    Joan said, “Well, it is very nice, but it's all over. My husband's been assigned
                    to Vietnam” and that she had to decide whether she was going to the Philippines
                    with the children or to the States. Freeman said, “When are you going to
                    Vietnam?” and he mused, “Those Vietnamese women — they don't walk, they sort of
                    glide as they go across the street. I can still remember how beautiful they
                    are.” I thought that was amusing, but Joan said, “Oh, so that's what it's all
                    about!”</p>
                <p>The last time we met I was talking about being transferred from Morocco back to
                    Washington as the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa. Sam Adams was the
                    Assistant Administrator, and this was in November of 1969. I was Sam Adams's
                    deputy from November 1969 to February 1972. That was during a Republican
                    Administration. Dr. Hannah was the AID Administrator. Looking back, one major
                    problem was a management problem. The African region was providing assistance to
                    over 40 countries. They had gone through a number of different organizational
                    structures: one, to have the field missions in all the countries, although some
                    of the missions were quite small. Then in the interest of economy, they closed
                    the smaller field operations and moved them back to Washington, and tried to
                    backstop, e.g. Benin or Niger from Washington. Well, that didn't work too well.
                    So we were confronted with the problem of how do we operate programs in both big
                    and small countries. We came up with the idea of regional support offices. It
                    was during Sam's tenure that a regional office was opened in Nairobi, and one in
                    Abidjan, which they had contract officers, lawyers, engineers, and they
                    backstopped the smaller programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the regional economic development service
                        offices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes, at that time they were called regional support offices. It was
                    economy of scale, wherein the regional offices had the specialized staff, which
                    we couldn't afford to have in all these small countries. They would travel to
                    each country to help develop the projects. There were sort of itinerant
                    technicians.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The other major operation during that period concerned Southern Africa. Apartheid
                    was in full bloom, and at that time, the front line states were Botswana,
                    Lesotho, and Swaziland. Ten or fifteen years later it was Mozambique and
                    Zimbabwe. During Sam's tenure, we started the first USAID programs in those
                    front-line states. I was sent on the first mission to organize the initial AID
                    programs. It was quite an experience because you had to charter a plane out of
                    South Africa. They knew what we were up to, and they weren't too happy about the
                    Americans going into these countries, which bordered on South Africa to develop
                    aid programs. I remember sitting for a very long time in the airport in
                    Johannesburg until they cleared our papers for this charter flight. We visited
                    the three countries: Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. We had a meeting in Swazi
                    with the Minister of Finance, and we were explaining the USAID program, and the
                    kinds of things we might do. He looked up and he said, “Well, you have this
                    subsidy program where you give these sugar quotas to countries, and we grow
                    sugar here in Swaziland. Now, if we could get a quota of 5 or 10 thousand tons
                    from the United States, you wouldn't have to have an AID program. You all
                    wouldn't have to come halfway across the world. You could stay home and we would
                    be just as happy to have this sugar quota, which would probably have a bigger
                    impact on our economy than your AID program.” I replied, “Probably so, but we in
                    AID have no voice in determining who gets the sugar quotas.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pretty savvy fellow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes. This was in Swaziland. And then we went to Botswana. They were
                    very excited in Gaborone, the capital because they were opening their first
                    professional cinema building. It seemed before that all the films were seen in
                    the town hall. We negotiated the beginnings of the Botswana programs at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what you were emphasizing in those
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Agriculture, basically. Also, in Botswana we got involved in building a
                    road from Gaborone to Smithtown. In Lesotho, one of the poorest countries,
                    surely agriculture was the priority.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Another function I had was to serve as the head of the US delegation to the
                    Consultative Group meetings. There is now all this talk about the severe debt
                    problems in Africa. I remember it was discussed at a CG meeting for Zaire. Zaire
                    had a major debt servicing problem, even at that time in the 1970's. The CG
                    meetings involved the IMF, the World Bank, and the bilateral donors, and there
                    was a World Bank presentation of what external resources were needed to cover
                    the country's balance of payments deficit. A major item, in the balance of
                    payments deficit was the debt service. The traditional way of handling this
                    problem was to ask the bilateral donors to provide more aid in effect to service
                    the debt because all monies are fungible. I asked, “What are the possibilities
                    of some more debt relief? The IMF representative said, “We're not prepared to
                    talk about the impact of the debt servicing on the resource envelope.” The
                    French delegate raised his flag and said, “This is not a suitable discussion for
                    a Consultative Group meeting. Debt relief is a Paris Club responsibility, and
                    this should not be raised here.” Some of the other bilateral donors joined the
                    US in arguing that the debt service has a major impact on the resource
                    availability. The IMF response was that debt is a contract and that must be
                    honored, and we expect the donors to provide more assistance to help service the
                    debts.</p>
                <p>So even in those days the debt problem was growing, but the traditional way of
                    handling it was that debt relief was the last step. Now debt relief or
                    forgiveness is very much in the forefront and people feel that the debt problem
                    has to be addressed first if we want to see growth and development in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>Another problem I remember involved Al Hurt, who was the mission director in
                    Senegal. He made a presentation about the food security in Senegal and in the
                    rest of French-speaking or West Africa. The demand for PL 480 was going up very
                    significantly each year. He said, “When you ask the locals what's happening,
                    they would say it was the drought. But there hasn't been a drought for three
                    years,” He said what was happening was that the population was growing very
                    rapidly, and that the traditional agricultural methods just couldn't produce the
                    grains to keep up with the consumption demands. This impact of the population
                    explosion was becoming apparent, but the local people were saying it was the
                    drought, when it was really something much more fundamental in terms of what
                    they could produce given the population explosion. The US was in the leadership
                    in pushing for the recognition that population growth was impacting very
                    importantly on economic and social development. But it never really got the kind
                    of attention from the recipient countries and from other donors that it really
                    required. And you can still see the problem in Africa. With three percent annual
                    population growth rate, 3 or 4 percent GDP growth rate provides little or not
                    per capita income growth, and that's still the case in many African
                    countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Another operation I remember was a program loan planned for Ethiopia. Ernie Stern
                    was the head of PPC, and he was much interested in this loan, which was for the
                    agricultural sector. Although Ethiopia was basically a rural country, even if
                    you added in rural roads, the percentage of the budget that was earmarked for
                    agriculture, was around 15 percent. It was terribly low. Under this program
                    loan, all of the counterpart funds were earmarked for agriculture. Well, Mr.
                    Stern did not find that sufficient in terms of additionality. He said, “They can
                    only get this loan if they match the amount of US funding with their own funds.
                    Otherwise you might just be substituting what they had planned to put in the
                    budget for agriculture before the US funding was available.” We want to get a
                    multiple increase in the funding for agriculture.” In the end it did go through
                    the way Stern had in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the way it worked out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes, but it still wasn't enough. Again, it's always a question of
                    commitment. I know you served in Ethiopia, so you remember better than I. For
                    years, we were working on trying to improve the tenancy arrangements for the
                    peasant farmers. The legislation would get so far, and then it would go to the
                    Council of Elders, and they would reject it. They're going to think about it for
                    another year. So I don't remember if they succeeded in breaking the very tough
                    tenancy laws, which kept the Ethiopian peasantry in a state of poverty.</p>
                <p>Another incident I remember concerned US tariffs. During that period, 1970-71, we
                    had a very bad balance of payments situation in the United States, and we passed
                    a ten percent import tariff across the board. All the African countries, through
                    their Ambassadors, protested and they wanted to see Bill Rogers, who was the
                    Secretary of State and David Newsom, who was the head of the Africa region in
                    State. They made a demarche and said that if the US had to impose this tariff,
                    it was regrettable, but they would like poor African countries to be exempt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Newsom was the Assistant Secretary for Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Right. Secretary Newsom explained that under the General Agreement for
                    Trade and Tariffs, we could not discriminate in favor of some countries and
                    allow Africans not to be subjected to this tariff. But they still wanted to see
                    Secretary Rogers, and that was arranged. The African Ambassadors were divided
                    into two groups. The English speaking ones stood in one group and the French
                    speaking ones were in another group with an interpreter, who was simultaneously
                    interpreting Secretary Rogers' comments. Rogers started off by saying that this
                    action was something that we didn't care to do, but that the balance of payments
                    situation required we take action. Then he said, “I understand that Secretary
                    Newsom explained to you why we cannot make an exemption because of the GATT
                    rules.”</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Then, I don't know what possessed the Secretary, but I guess he could see their
                    faces and that the Ambassadors weren't very happy. He said, “This situation
                    reminds me of a World War II song, which was very popular, entitled, 'I Can't
                    Give You Anything But Love, Baby'.” The interpreter looked at Rogers, with a
                    look saying, “Well, I guess I have to translate this.” And you could see the
                    Ambassadors' quizzical expression, people thinking, “What's the message
                    here?”</p>
                <p>Then, suddenly, the Dean of the corps of the African Ambassadors, who was from
                    Liberia, and was very well spoken, said, “Mr. Secretary, I would like to respond
                    as the Dean of the African Ambassadors.” And he said, “Well, we heard what the
                    Secretary said, and I want to say to my French-speaking colleagues, whom I'm
                    sure will understand; that if a woman gives you love, she gives you everything.
                    If the United States gives us love then they will give us everything.”</p>
                <p>I thought Rogers was going to hug him, because he just saved the day. When the
                    Liberian Ambassador made very light of it, everybody sort of chuckled, whether
                    they were happy or not, and that was the end of the meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Africa at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: In those days, '69-'72, things were upbeat in Africa. School
                    enrollments were increasing, universities were expanding, exports and growth
                    rates were expanding, unlike the late '70s and early '80s, when things started
                    to go downhill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any recollection of the Biafran crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The Biafran crisis was very serious. They brought in Bill Kontos, a
                    special advisor. You were involved in that, too, as the Office Director for
                    Central Africa. It was very helpful to Sam Adams and I because it was a major
                    problem, and we needed help. Biafra got a lot of White House attention and we
                    were relying on you and Bill Kontos to backstop our efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the development philosophy for Africa at that
                        time? Were there any development concepts that we were promoting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I think that it was slightly before the basic human needs became the
                    key development policy. We were still following a fairly broad program of
                    capital projects and technical assistance, as well as large PL 480 programs in
                    Africa. Most of the aid was in agriculture, education, and health sectors. We
                    didn't do very much in industry. We were always trying to find a handle for
                    private sector development. But I never felt we were too successful at that.
                    Some of the funds that were generated under PL 480 were available as Cooley
                    loans for the private sector.</p>
                <p>I remember someone from Senegal saying how difficult it was for young Africans,
                    because our heads are in the sky with computers, but our feet are still in the
                    stone age. I remember a trip to Liberia during that time. One thinks a country
                    is underdeveloped when they plow with a donkey or camels, without mechanical
                    power to plow. But in Liberia I did see a peasant plowing with a stick, just
                    trying to make a furrow with a stick. That really shocks you that people are
                    trying to eke out a living without even an iron tool. So there was a long way to
                    go in many of those countries. But it was more of an upbeat period. School
                    enrollment was up, infant mortality was falling, and the general macroeconomic
                    framework was reasonably effective. The African countries didn't have the kind
                    of deteriorating economic situation that developed in the late '70s and
                    '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I was in the Africa region in Washington from 1969-72. Where were you
                    at that time?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in the Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: You were back from Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was back from Nigeria, and I was Director for Central
                        and West Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: So you should remember as much about the program as I would.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I left there in 1970, and went to Ghana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Wasn't it true that Ghana was kind of upbeat then?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well Ghana was going through this debt rescheduling
                        exercise. It was one of the first countries to go through a rescheduling
                        before the Paris Club meetings were organized. We used to have them in
                        London. That was one of the phenomenons at that time. But it was—the Korry
                        Report exercise came—that led to the effort to reduce the number of
                        countries, I think that was prior to your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The Korry Report got a lot of attention. I always felt that we should
                    have concentrated on fewer countries. For small countries, like Chad, the
                    African Development Bank, and the World Bank had much more resources than AID.
                    My point is if the US is only providing $2 to 3 million a year to a Chad, what
                    real impact does it have? Very often the overhead or administrative costs could
                    amount to one-third of the AID level. It seemed more effective for the US to
                    concentrate on 12 or 15 countries and the other countries in Africa could get
                    their resources from IDA and the African Development Bank. The US should use its
                    membership in these organizations to try to strike a balance between its
                    bilateral and multilateral programs, but when AID tries to run operations in 45
                    countries in Africa, it dilutes its effort and effectiveness.</p>
                <p>Advancement to Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Program and Policy
                    Coordination - 1972</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with Dr. Hannah? Did you get
                        acquainted with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Well, that came later. I worked in PPC from 1972 to 1977, I think that
                    was one of the longest tenures, five years in PPC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your position was what? You were the head of PPC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Right. Assistant Administrator for PPC. I was appointed in 1972, the
                    year that Nixon was reelected, and they were feeling their oats. When Hannah
                    proposed that I be Assistant Administrator for PPC, the White House said, “Well,
                    what's his political affiliation?” I said to Dr. Hannah, “You know, that's the
                    first time in my career that this question has been asked. I consider myself a
                    professional civil servant. My politics have never been questioned.” Dr. Hannah,
                    “Yes, but you have to understand. This is a presidential appointment.” I said,
                    “In the past, the heads of PPC were very distinguished economists, like Hollis
                    Chenery and Gus Raines, and I don't think they were asked what's your political
                    affiliation?”</p>
                <p>What was really ironic — I was a registered Republican! So Hannah said, “What are
                    you making a fuss about? That's all they want to hear. They are convinced that
                    AID is filled with Democrats.” I said, “It's the principle. I'm not a political
                    appointee. I'm a professional.” Dr. Hannah said, “Well, we're going to tell them
                    that you are a registered Republican. They are going to feel very happy, and
                    that was the end of the discussion.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>The next step was going up for Senate confirmation. And at that time, Matt Harvey
                    was in charge of AID's legislative affairs office. Matt said, “OKAY, you live in
                    Maryland now, but what state do you come from?” I said, “I'm from New Jersey.”
                    And he said, “Senator Case is from New Jersey and he is on the confirmation
                    committee.” He said, “What do you have in common with Senator Case?” I said,
                    “Well, he went to Rutgers and Columbia University — He's a graduate of the same
                    two schools that I attended. We went to see Senator Case, and he said, “Oh, this
                    is a piece of cake. When we start the hearing, I'll make a presentation about
                    Mr. Birnbaum.” Not that he thought there would be any problem, but it's always
                    nice to have a “friend” right up front. The only senator who raised a question
                    was Stuart Symington. He said, “Mr. Birnbaum, I understand you are going to be
                    in some office that works with the Development Assistance Committee and what
                    these people do is rate industrialized countries on their aid giving
                    performance. They measure aid as a percentage of the county's Gross National
                    Product. Senator Symington went on to say, “Do you know who's at the top of that
                    list now? What country is considered the best aid giver? Portugal.” Because they
                    still had those colonies, and the DAC accepts what they do in Mozambique and
                    Angola as foreign aid. Number two was France, because of all the assistance they
                    give to Reunion and to other colonies. Mr. Birnbaum, what do you think about a
                    system like that?” Matt Harvey said to me, “Just keep nodding your head, like
                    you're agreeing with him.” Symington concluded, “I think it is scandalous that
                    we support a system that rates a country like Portugal as the greatest
                    benefactor of mankind.” There wasn't anything for me to say; he'd made his
                    speech, and that was the end of it.</p>
                <p>I got to know Dr. Hannah quite well. Every year we went to DAC high level
                    meetings. For twenty years, we were pushing other countries to increase their
                    aid levels, and to get close to the U.N. target of 0.7 percent of Official
                    Development Assistance, (ODA) as a percentage of Gross National Product. We did
                    have considerable success, when you look at how Germany and Japan increased
                    their aid levels, and of course, the Nordic countries were reaching almost one
                    percent of GNP. The United States was going the other way, with our percentage
                    falling. At these DAC high level meetings, it was the other countries lecturing
                    the United States that our aid levels had flattened out, and as a percentage of
                    our Gross National Product were falling. The shoe was on the other foot. We
                    responded by talking about how we were going to improve the quality of our aid,
                    and concentrating on basic human needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we counter that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Well, it was very hard. I remember one year, we had a recession in the
                    US and GNP figures went down. So as a result, our ODA performance improved
                    minusculely, and looked better. I said to Dr. Hannah, “What an irony, our GNP
                    was down because we had a recession, our imports were also down, but our aid
                    performance as percentage of GNP looks better. The impact of the recession on
                    the developing countries is devastating. They used to say that if the
                    industrialized countries sneeze, the developing countries get pneumonia.” In
                    absolute terms, however, the US remained the largest donor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there some attempt to counter that by saying we
                        were providing vast amounts of military assistance, unlike anybody else, or
                        something like that, and therefore we were carrying a bigger burden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Those points were made, but that wasn't a point you could make very
                    effectively with development people. Actually, this was a point that Senator
                    Symington made during my confirmation hearings, saying that we were defending
                    the free world, and allowing other countries great savings in their defense
                    budgets, which was true.</p>
                <p>I remember that one time at a DAC meeting, the Japanese representative had a very
                    positive statement about our aid effort and our defense effort. “Well, it seems
                    that he did not have a written statement, to give to the interpreters. He had a
                    very heavy Japanese accent in his English. So English speakers couldn't
                    understand him. I turned on the French interpretation, and I could hear the
                    interpreters saying in French, “God, I don't understand a word of what he's
                    saying. How can I translate?” So at that one meeting where there were some
                    positive statements said about the US aid effort, they couldn't be communicated
                    clearly.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>One of the major functions that one is involved in PPC is the Congressional
                    hearings. Every year I would go up to the Hill with Dr. Hannah, which I remember
                    very vividly. Otto Passman was chairman of the subcommittee on Appropriations
                    for Foreign Operations. Al Furman from AID's Legislative Affairs office was on
                    one side of Dr. Hannah, with all these briefing books, and I would be on the
                    other side. I remember one time Passman was throwing questions at Hannah. Al was
                    trying to find the right table with figures, and I'm whispering into Dr.
                    Hannah's ear. Passman rapped the gavel, and he points at me and said, “Mr.
                    Bookkeeper, you talk when I ask you to talk. But otherwise, Mr. Bookkeeper, you
                    keep your mouth shut!” That was the way he conducted the hearings. Dr. Hannah
                    handled himself extremely well. Passman would asked, “Why are there six jeeps
                    rather than four in this range management project in Ethiopia,” all these
                    nitty-gritty questions. Hannah would say, “I don't want to talk about that.”
                    Today everybody talks about globalization, and that was what Hannah was talking
                    about in those days, saying, “It's going to be one world, and if we don't
                    address these problems of health and education, they're going to come back and
                    impact on our country. Congressman Passman, what we're talking about is the
                    world for your grandchildren and my grandchildren.” So Dr. Hannah never would
                    let Passman focus on small operational things, and always try to lift the
                    debate. And he was very effective that way.</p>
                <p>The hearings were very interesting, because often Congressmen's respective
                    positions had little to do with whether they were Democrats or Republicans. One
                    of the strongest supporters on the committee, who could handle Passman, was a
                    Republican, Conte, from Massachusetts, who was very pro foreign aid. He
                    understood what Hannah was saying, and he would always make a very positive
                    statement, just sort of ignore Passman. So the split wasn't that the Democrats
                    were always the liberals and the Republicans the conservatives. During that
                    period a lot of effort was spent on getting appropriations for Vietnam. Passman
                    was very supportive of our efforts in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Passman used to speak in very long phrases, and he didn't necessarily start with
                    the subject, so you didn't know what the hell he was talking about until three
                    or four sentences went by, and then it would be apparent. Passman had convinced
                    himself that the opposition on the Hill to all the aid to Vietnam was because it
                    was on a grant basis, and if it was switched to a loan basis, there would be
                    much more support on the Hill for aid to Vietnam. I remember Dr. Hannah asking
                    us if Vietnam could service loans, even the soft type of loans that AID gave. At
                    that time the only export out of South Vietnam was something called kettle fish.
                    Exports were something like $20 million or less per year. So it would be very
                    hard to make a case that they could service loans. But we spent 30 minutes that
                    day with Passman saying, “I think I've convinced the President,” (We're trying
                    to figure out which President he's talking about, our President or the
                    Vietnamese President) to move to loans, and all the opposition on the Hill will
                    fade away.</p>
                <p>We're not really communicating, but that was a typical experience with Otto
                    Passman.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were Hannah's views about development strategy, or
                        what should be emphasized?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I made a trip to Nigeria with Dr. Hannah. We visited a project which
                    involved getting fertilizer and a technological package to peanut farmers in
                    Kano in Northern Nigeria. This project had been in progress for a number of
                    years and we weren't very successful in distributing the fertilizer on time, and
                    getting the message across. Our technicians were explaining how difficult it was
                    to transport and distribute the fertilizer. While we were standing there, in
                    some little village; it was very, very hot and, they start passing around cold
                    beers. We were hundreds of miles from civilization, in a little village drinking
                    cold beers. So Dr. Hannah says, “Where do these beers come from?” Answer - “Oh,
                    people get them in that little store there.” Hannah says, “Now I see what the
                    problem is. When private guys are running things and trying to make a buck, they
                    somehow get beer up here from Lagos, or some other place. You people are trying
                    to do it through bureaucrats and fail. Why don't you engage these storekeepers
                    to sell fertilizer in small bags?” Hannah was pretty quick on the uptake. We
                    went to visit another project. We were building a school of veterinarian
                    medicine in northern Nigeria from scratch, and you can imagine what kind of a
                    problem that would be, because this was one of the most underdeveloped areas.
                    There had been a lot of problems with the project. It was off schedule and a lot
                    of people had come out from Washington asking questions, and the poor project
                    manager who was out of the university — I think it might have been Wyoming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were from Kansas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: He was getting tired of the criticism. Dr. Hannah asked the same
                    questions that any number of visitors asked, and the poor guy just lost his cool
                    and said, “Dr. Hannah, I can get this project back on schedule, and get
                    everything done, if you would just get rid of Nigerians.” Hannah responded,
                    “Well, it's just the frustration of trying to get things approved, when the
                    cultures are so different.”</p>
                <p>You do have to be so careful in the questions you ask. The project manager showed
                    us the plans. I said, “What is this?” He said, “This is an operating room, where
                    we operate on small animals, cats and dogs.” I'm thinking, “My God, they're not
                    going to be training veterinarians in Nigeria to be taking care of cats and
                    dogs. In Africa, you don't take care of a dog, you just let him run around the
                    village.” So I said, “You're going to be training people to operate and care for
                    cats and dogs?” He said, “No, Mr. Birnbaum, the anatomy of a cat and dog is very
                    similar to that of a horse or a cow. But it's much easier in teaching students
                    to get a cat on an operating table than it is a horse. Have you ever tried it?”
                    It's better not ask questions if you don't know what it's all about. So I think
                    after that, the project manager must have said, “If I could get rid of all the
                    Nigerians, and all the AID visitors...!”</p>
                <p>It was during that period in PPC that we got involved in the basic human
                    needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The new direction, as they called it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Right. Among the liberals and the development experts, there was the
                    perception that you needed a direct approach to address basic human needs - the
                    trickle-down theory didn't work. What was interesting is that, even Otto
                    Passman, in one of our hearings, expressed similar concerns. He was very upset
                    that South Vietnam fell as quickly as it did. He said that one of the problems
                    was that we weren't dealing with the people, we were dealing with the big shots,
                    who were corrupt and you have to deal with and get support of the common people.
                    It always stuck in my mind that understandably sociologists and economists were
                    saying that we have to focus on poverty questions, on basic human needs. But for
                    a conservative like Passman, it was unusual. I remember him saying, “We put a
                    lot of treasure in Vietnam, US blood and money, and it failed. It failed so
                    quickly because it had no roots. The people weren't with the program.” How much
                    real support and understanding Passman had for the basic human needs the way
                    other people understood it, I don't know.</p>
                <p>When I was in PPC, Dr. Hannah was the Administrator from 72-'74. From 74-'76 it
                    was Dan Parker, and I think that it might have been with Dan Parker that I went
                    up to the Hill, and Passman made this little speech about why we failed in
                    Vietnam. And then in my last year, '77, John Gilligan came. So that it was
                    interesting to have three different personalities as the head of AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about this basic human needs switch,
                        from the previous strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I think we all felt the emphasis on basic human needs was overdue. The
                    way the PPC got involved was typical. We started to write these very long
                    airgrams sent world-wide on how you do primary education and preventative health
                    projects. They went through many, many revisions. I guess as an ex-field person
                    I felt that you have to provide a certain amount of guidance, but these projects
                    have to be country specific and developed in the field. I always like to tell
                    little anecdotes. I remember when I was in Morocco, Ambassador Henry Tasker was
                    considered a very aggressive ambassador. And he said, “Anytime you get a
                    worldwide airgram or telex, you can throw it in the basket. Because that's not
                    addressed specifically to US Embassy, Morocco. It's addressed to everybody, so
                    that doesn't necessarily mean you or me.”</p>
                <p>So I was saying to the staff in PPC, “Yes, we should have a framework for basic
                    human needs, but the program will be different in different countries.” It was a
                    very time consuming effort, but again, AID was in the leadership. It's only been
                    recently that we've heard that adjustment programs weren't addressing poverty
                    and basic human needs. But providing basic services can often become a real test
                    of effective communication.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>One of the major health problems was kids were getting dysentery and then they
                    suffered severe dehydration. An infant would die within three or four days
                    without sufficient liquids. And I don't know if it was AID, but someone came up
                    with this medication, just water with the right mixture of salt and sugar, which
                    would end the dehydration. I was in Senegal in the countryside, and they were
                    explaining this treatment to these Senegalese women. People were perfectly
                    bilingual, so it wasn't a question of lack of understanding. And what the women
                    said was, “What you're giving us is what the witch doctor would give us. We want
                    antibiotics. We want the modern medicine.” Of course, for dehydration, the
                    antibiotics would do nothing, and the children would die. But to make the sell
                    was very difficult that just a little water with sugar, and salt would do the
                    trick. And you could see by their expressions that they couldn't believe that it
                    was a simple as that. So what you communicate in a fifteen page PPC airgram on
                    basic health services may not be understood by the recipients.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, there were two phrases, the poor
                        majority, and the poorest of the poor, seemed to suggest essentially
                        different strategies for development. And some people took the poorest of
                        the poor very seriously. Were you familiar with that debate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I got involved with this question in my next assignment with IFAD,
                    which concentrated on the poor.</p>
                <p>I remember a gentleman who came from Pakistan, trying to explain to Dan Parker
                    and myself, that in Pakistan there are two groups of poor people. At the very
                    bottom are the poorest of the poor, who have no assets at all. They might not
                    even be tenant farmers. They are just day laborers if they are lucky. He was
                    saying that it was almost impossible to help them, and was recommending to us
                    that donors should not put their resources there. Right above these poorest of
                    the poor are some very poor people, by any standards, but with some help, they
                    can improve. He was telling us that for the ones at the very bottom, “It might
                    sound heartless, but there's no way that you can really make an impact and help
                    them. You have to hope that the next generation or two will somehow transit
                    out.”</p>
                <p>I remember in Morocco, we had an urban sites and services' project. We did a
                    survey of what goes on there in this big slum area. People would come in from
                    the countryside, and they would actually be sleeping in the street, as homeless
                    people, and they would try to make their way as daily workers. The next stage
                    was that they moved off the street, and were sleeping in somebody's shanty, that
                    is, in a tiny courtyard next to the shanty. What we were witnessing was the
                    upward mobility that seems to go on. It's very slow. Sometimes it takes the guy
                    five or six years. Then he has his own shanty with a tin roof, and he's helping
                    some other guy, hammering out copper plates. So that's another kind of story,
                    one can arrive penniless, with no assets, and yet make his way. It was very
                    important to understand the factors involved in this little bit of upward
                    mobility.</p>

                        PPC was encouraging?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: We previously discussed PPC's involvement in promoting basic human
                    needs. PPC's main functions were preparation of the AID budget to OMB and the
                    congressional presentation. One year, OMB came out with the instruction, that in
                    preparing the budget submission, we should do two budgets. One, if we had 15
                    percent more money, what would we do in addition to what we would normally plan
                    to do, and what we would eliminate, if we had a 15 percent cut. I remember Dan
                    Parker was the AID Administrator, and I said, “We should not do this because
                    once we laid out what programs we would cut, we would be vulnerable to OMB cuts.
                    Parker said, “Well, how are you going to ignore an instruction?” To make a long
                    story short, at that time Kissinger was the Secretary. So we got the message to
                    Kissinger, and he called OMB and said, “Forget it.” We weren't going to lay
                    ourselves open to cuts by submitting a budget substantially below our
                    requirements. So that was just a question of hunkering down, stonewalling them,
                    and we submitted one budget, with the idea of course that this was the bare
                    bones. As you know, the budget submission always gets cut anyway.</p>

                    was handled separately. When I was in PPC, the Vietnamese Bureau took care of
                    their battles with OMB and with the Hill.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: A lot of time was spent on Vietnam. I remember one year Kissinger said
                    to us, “Why do you put yourself through the torture of an annual authorization
                    and appropriation? Why don't we go for a two-year appropriation?” There were a
                    lot of other people in the room who told Kissinger that with growing opposition
                    on the Hill, what makes you think they're going to give us a two-year
                    appropriation? There were a lot of meetings on that issue. State had certain
                    priority countries, Turkey, for example. But in those days the aid levels were
                    fairly generous. There wasn't as much of a trade-off between AID and State
                    priorities. I do remember Kissinger saying he wished he was Secretary of State
                    in the '50s, when there was a Presidential Contingency Fund, with a couple of
                    hundred million dollars. If a crisis came up, and the President and the
                    Secretary had to do something, they could tap this fund. Now there were demands
                    like that, but there wasn't that kind of funding flexibility.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet with Kissinger yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of those kinds of
                        situations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Extremely capable, but a man with a very big ego. I remember one
                    session — Kissinger was saying that one of the reasons we were not succeeding on
                    the Hill with the appropriations for South Vietnam was that we hadn't convinced
                    Congress and the American people that the Russians and the Chinese were
                    providing the North Vietnamese with twice as much assistance as we were. And
                    that if we made that clear, then what we were requesting wouldn't look out of
                    proportion. Kissinger said, “I want the figures on aid to North Vietnam split
                    between military and economic aid.” Chuck Cooper, who was one of the top US
                    advisors on Vietnam said, “Look, the Russians and Chinese give very little
                    economic aid and the total value of their aid is less than ours. We're providing
                    a lot of consumer goods to South Vietnam. The communists don't provide that.
                    What they're providing is the military stuff.” We were providing all kinds of
                    civilian goods — motor bikes, tape recorders. Kissinger said, “How do you know
                    that?” Cooper said, “Well, we do aerial reconnaissance. We can see what's
                    off-loaded in all their ports.” Kissinger said, “Well, I want specific figures.”
                    He had the attitude that we were the most powerful country in the world,
                    therefore we should have the best intelligence. Kissinger then picked up the
                    phone and called General Walters, who was the deputy head of CIA, and he said,
                    “You get your people working tonight. I want a complete breakdown by commodity
                    of all aid received by North Vietnam from Russia and China.” Sometime later,
                    Chuck Cooper told me that the CIA confirmed what he had told Kissinger earlier,
                    but given his ego, he wouldn't listen.</p>

                    Its First Vice President - 1978-1983</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>A very interesting part of the history of AID and US foreign relations concerned
                    the World Food Conference in Rome in November 1974. Kissinger gave a major
                    address, which we worked on with maybe 10 or 12 revisions. In that speech,
                    Kissinger said that no child should go to bed hungry, and that within a decade
                    we will succeed in that objective. So looking back on it now, some 20 years
                    later, we still have not reached that objective! I was on the committee that
                    wrote that speech. The conference recommended the establishment of a World Food
                    Council and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The idea was
                    given the huge oil price increases from which the OPEC countries were reaping
                    large gains, we were going to “invite” them to finance small farmer operations
                    to increase food production and the standard of living of the rural poor.</p>
                <p>It was very interesting that the first reaction from Germany, the United States,
                    and a number of industrialized countries, was if we were going to increase food
                    production, we have to get the production up of the subsistence farmers, who
                    need the right technological packages, etc. but we don't need a new
                    international financial institution. Yes, we want to mobilize more money from
                    our OPEC friends and this can be done through contributions to the existing
                    IFIs, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian Development
                    Bank — earmarked for small farmer programs. And that's the position we took.
                    People at Treasury were so convinced that that position would carry, that they
                    showed no interest in being involved in the formulation of IFAD. Even State was
                    fairly convinced that IFAD wasn't going to fly, so it wound up that AID was
                    responsible for backstopping IFAD.</p>
                <p>At the World Food Conference, however, it was agreed to establish IFAD and they
                    set up a preparatory commission and countries were invited to send delegates to
                    a series of meetings to negotiate the Articles of Agreement. AID represented the
                    US government, and as the head of PPC, I was selected to head the US delegation
                    to the preparatory commission meetings. Our initial position was we don't need
                    another international financial organization. What happened, though, was that
                    this idea appealed to the Shah of Iran. They said the Shah was still bruised
                    over the fact that the Asian Development Bank went to the Philippines and not to
                    Tehran, and he wanted this new international organization to be headquartered in
                    Tehran. Iran would be one of the major contributors, and Saudi Arabia said that
                    they were very much interested in this new fund, and they would be a major
                    participant.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Well, when Kissinger sensed that two of the biggest OPEC countries were for IFAD,
                    we took a different tack. It was very interesting, at the first meeting of the
                    preparatory commission, the Russians came. But when they found out it was going
                    to be a fund and they were going to have to contribute money and that it would
                    be run as an IFI, they didn't come after that. The US took the position that
                    there can be a new organization, but we won't make a contribution. What we were
                    going to do was step up our AID allocations for agriculture, and particularly
                    allocations for small farmer operations in all the countries. So we said that
                    our contribution to IFAD would be by attribution. So I went through a
                    preparatory meeting or two, with this US position of contribution by
                    attribution, but we were also doing “the legal work” on the agreement. Again, it
                    was Kissinger and Parker who realized if we want to capture the OPEC money, we
                    can't say the US is not going to contribute. So that position was changed, and
                    the US would be a contributor. The deal was that Saudis would provide the
                    president, and the permanent headquarters would be in Tehran. We said, “Well,
                    it's going to be very hard to start from scratch. It would be a big advantage to
                    start in Rome because FAO can help us by providing certain qualified people.
                    After the first three years in Rome, we'll transfer to Tehran.” The Iranians
                    accepted that.</p>
                <p>Then we went to the business of negotiating the framework for IFAD. We had a lot
                    of Third World activists, who wanted a new organization. With the OPEC countries
                    standing very tall then, they said, “This can't be like an ordinary IFI. The
                    developing countries should have one-third of the votes, the OPEC countries will
                    have one-third of the votes, and the industrialized countries will have
                    one-third.” The way the developing countries looked at this was, “That means we
                    have two-thirds of the vote because the OPEC countries are with us.”</p>
                <p>That was considered a major breakthrough by the developing countries because here
                    was an international financial institution, where the major contributors would
                    not have a majority of the votes. The other thing that was different was a
                    complete emphasis on small farmers, with a new approach on project design. What
                    you would do is go out and find who are the small, poor farmers, where are they
                    located, what are their conditions, and then design the project to fit their
                    specific needs.</p>
                <p>The first preparatory commission meeting to establish IFAD took place in the
                    Spring of 1975, and in June of '76, we were ready for what they call the
                    Plenipotentiary meeting to accept the Articles of Agreement. From the outset, it
                    was assumed that the OPEC countries and the industrialized countries were to put
                    up 50-50 shares or equal shares of the initial capital because they were
                    partners in this fund and had equal voting rights. IFAD was to be like IDA;
                    these were to be grant funds, and every three years there would be a
                    replenishment. We had three categories of countries: the industrialized
                    countries were Category I, OPEC countries were Category II, and Category III
                    were the developing countries, some of which contributed very small amounts of
                    money.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I remember, we went to testify on the Hill. The head of GC office in AID at the
                    time, Arthur Gardner and myself. He was looking at the language of the
                    authorization bill, which called for the initial capital for IFAD to a little
                    over $1 billion, and the US was going to provide $200 million. So it was a very
                    large share. Gardner was looking at the wording in the authorization bill and
                    said, “Phil, it says here equal shares, by Category I and II. If there's a
                    difference of a dollar in the respective contributions of OPEC and the
                    industrialized countries that's not equal, and you could have major trouble.” So
                    I said, “What should we do?” He said, “Let's change the wording to equitable'.”
                    I said, “Hey, that's a hell of a change.” He said, “Yes.” So literally, standing
                    in the congressional corridors, we changed the wording in the authorization to
                    'equitable' shares between Categories I and II.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned there was this big plenipotentiary meeting in Rome in June 1976 to
                    sign the Articles of Agreement. The President of Italy, everyone and his uncle
                    were present. Dan Parker, the AID administrator, was there and he was glowing.
                    It was the culmination of about a year and a half of hard work. Everything was
                    agreed and everybody seemed to be very pleased with the agreement.</p>
                <p>Then the spokesman gets up for OPEC, his name is Ibrahim Shihata, who is now
                    General Counsel for the World Bank. Shihata delivers three bombshells, “One, the
                    preamble to the Articles of Agreement has to be changed. It has to include the
                    phrase that Zionism is racism. Two, Israel cannot be a member of IFAD. Three,
                    OPEC countries interpreted equitable shares to mean forty percent contribution
                    from the OPEC countries, and sixty percent contribution from the industrialized
                    countries.”</p>
                <p>I don't remember who it was from State in our delegation, turned around and said
                    to me, “That's the end of your IFAD.”</p>
                <p>You can imagine the consternation. We were able to defeat the idea that the
                    preamble should state that Zionism is racism.' Any number of people made
                    statements that IFAD's preamble was not the place for such statements and OPEC
                    backed off. Next the business of casting Israel out really was interesting. No
                    industrialized country spoke in opposition — not the Scandinavians, not the US,
                    and there was a high level State Department person present. But the
                    representative from El Salvador got up, and he said, “This is not acceptable.
                    There are a lot of small countries in the world. The big and powerful countries,
                    no matter where they are from, the east or the west, north or south, they think
                    they can push around little countries, and that they decide who's in and who's
                    out. That's not the U.N. system. If a country is a member of the U.N., nobody
                    can say they are out of a U.N. organization like IFAD. The representative from
                    Honduras, got up and said the same thing. Then some other people joined in.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Although the OPEC countries couldn't push Israel out there's a footnote in the
                    Articles of the Agreement, indicating that the Israelis, would not request any
                    funding from IFAD. A lot of pressure was put on the poor Israelis to provide a
                    letter to that effect. The Israelis indicated that they never intended to take
                    any funding, but were going to give technical assistance. So, we took care of
                    two bombshells, but we left the plenipotentiary meeting with no budging on the
                    40-60 shares.</p>
                <p>The plenipotentiary meeting objective was to reach agreement and then governments
                    would deposit their Instruments of Ratification and also deposit their pledges.
                    When Congress heard about the proposed 40/60 split, many people were terribly
                    agitated. And we were very upset. We thought there was an understanding there
                    would be 50-50 contributions from Category I and Category II. Shihata gave a
                    long speech in Rome, saying, “It could never be 50-50. The GNP of Germany is
                    greater than all the OPEC countries put together. Equal shares, he said, would
                    be preposterous. Forty percent contribution is more than we've given in any U.N.
                    organization. But we in the US Government and in the Congress felt misled
                    because, throughout all the IFAD negotiations, the OPEC countries led us to
                    believe that there would be equal contributions from Category I and II.
                    Kissinger went back to the Iranians asking for additional contributions. I
                    remember our Ambassador to Iran was Richard Holmes at the time; later he was the
                    head of the CIA. When the message went out that he should approach the Shah to
                    provide additional funding, he responded by saying, “We've got bigger fish to
                    fry with the Shah, much more important issues than this little IFAD
                    organization, I never heard of.” So another message came from Kissinger saying
                    that this was important. In the end, Iran raised their contribution by $20
                    million, and the Saudis in a magnanimous gesture, put in another $5 million. So
                    we wound up with a 57-43 ratio. Certain people on the Hill said that was not
                    acceptable. Senator Kasten from Wisconsin was adamant in his opposition.
                    Fortunately, Clem Zablocki was the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
                    Committee and he was more understanding. Dan Parker was testifying, and he was
                    very upset, as we felt we had been let down, even double crossed. Zablocki said,
                    “I understand. It's like going into a labor management negotiation, and you
                    think you have an understanding with the opposition, but you don't control those
                    people.” Zablocki said, “We'll let them get by with this, this time. But there
                    has to be a replenishment, and the OPEC countries want certain things; they'll
                    want IFAD's headquarters moved to Tehran, so we have some cards to play.”</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>We had spent over a year trying to up the OPEC contribution. Zablocki said, “You
                    know, the only people who are suffering are the poor people who are supposed to
                    get this money, and we can continue this for another year, but I don't see any
                    point in that.” He was a very strong chairman, and decided, “We'll go with
                    this.” I can't now remember the name of the democratic Senator from Wyoming, who
                    helped us on the Senate side and we squeaked through. But there were a lot of
                    people on the Hill saying “You misled us. You said it was going to be 50-50
                    sharing with the OPEC countries.” It is interesting to note that 43 percent
                    funding by the OPEC countries for IFAD far surpassed their level of contribution
                    to any other U.N. organization or IFI. For example, the Saudi share in FAO was
                    about three percent. In IFAD, Saudi Arabia had pledged $105 million, and Iran
                    $125 million. Venezuela's share, was $66 million and Nigeria was in for about
                    $28 million. By the fall of 1977, there were enough Instruments of Ratification
                    and contributions to meet the basic requirements, and IFAD started up on the
                    first of 1978.</p>
                <p>A Saudi, Al Sudairi, was picked as the President, and the United States as the
                    largest Category I contributor, was given the privilege of providing the Vice
                    President, and I was nominated. Al Sudairi had two degrees from American
                    Universities, so he was very “Americanized” and knew the score. He was also the
                    chairman of the Preparatory Commission and we had worked well together for a
                    year and a half drafting the Articles of Agreement. However, he came on a visit
                    to Washington in November of 1977, and he said he urgently wanted to see State
                    Department officials, the AID administrator, and told me “We have a big
                    problem.” He said, “This is not my idea, but we have the Iraqis, and the Libyans
                    as members of IFAD and they can't see their way clear to have a Jewish Vice
                    President!”</p>
                <p>It was very fortunate that Gilligan was the AID Administrator, because Gilligan
                    was an experienced politician. He had been Governor of Ohio, and he had been a
                    member of Congress, in the House. I spoke to Gilligan and he said, “OKAY, I'll
                    see him.” He told me later, what he said. It was an excellent lesson in how you
                    handle a problem like this.</p>
                <p>Gilligan told Al Sudairi the following: “One, Mr. Birnbaum was hired by the US
                    government, and we have no requirement that he has to indicate what his religion
                    is, and we don't care. Two: IFAD is a U.N. specialized agency and you people are
                    supposed to be spreading the idea of brotherhood in the world. IFAD is an
                    international fund, where someone's race, color, or religion should not be
                    considered. Three: If you persist in this matter and it gets to the Hill, you
                    won't get an appropriation. If this issue of discrimination gets out, you can
                    kiss US participation goodbye. It will gut the whole thing.”</p>
                <p>There were people in the State Department, saying nothing was official, but they
                    were telling me, “You ought to consider taking another position. This might be
                    an embarrassment to the US government.” In the end, there was no problem. After
                    the meeting with Gilligan, the whole issue was dropped. I worked in IFAD as vice
                    president for five years and it was never raised again as an issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The point is, if you handle a key issue immediately, and properly, in terms of
                    standing up for the principle, it goes away. If you start saying, “We'll
                    consider it...” you are in trouble. Interestingly enough, during my five years
                    at IFAD, I had to remind some of the Executive Directors, that IFAD was a U.N.
                    organization, an international organization, and had to operate accordingly and
                    respect certain principles.</p>
                <p>I served as Senior Vice President in IFAD for five years from 1978-1982. During
                    this time I was seconded from AID. IFAD has a specific mandate to help increase
                    food production and reduce rural poverty by providing assistance to small
                    farmers in developing countries around the world. In the initial three years of
                    operations IFAD committed $900 million for agricultural projects in over 60
                    countries.</p>
                <p>As Vice President, I supervised the Treasury Office (we had almost $500 million
                    in cash contributions, mainly from the OPEC countries and some industrialized
                    countries, to invest), the Controller's Office, the Loan Administration Office,
                    and the Personnel Services Division. As the Vice President, I was in charge of
                    coordinating the Annual Lending program and the administrative budget, including
                    staffing levels. When I arrived in January, 1987, we had three professionals on
                    board. By the end of 1980 we had 70 professionals. One of the most exciting
                    aspects was building the organizational structure and staff from ground zero.
                    The dedication and the work attitude of the staff was outstanding.</p>
                <p>There were two big problems during my IFAD tenure. The OPEC countries forced
                    additional oil price increases. So the feeling on the Hill against these OPEC
                    countries was running so strong. OPEC was earning huge profits and diddled us on
                    their IFAD share. So anytime I came back to Washington, they wanted to see me up
                    on the Hill, and were ready to eat me alive. I remember when the Republicans
                    came in in 1980 with President Reagan and they were saying, “We're going to get
                    these OPEC people and do away with IFAD.”</p>
                <p>Another serious problem, from a US standpoint, involved a loan scheduled for
                    Cuba. I was told by the US Executive Director to IFAD that it was not going to
                    go down well for me if IFAD makes a loan to Cuba.</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, maybe I was born under lucky stars.” Because in the same quarter
                    that the loan to Cuba is to go to IFAD the Board, we're proposing a loan to
                    Egypt.” This was after Sadat had gone to Israel. The Libyans and the Iraqis were
                    saying, “Over our dead body.” They were using the fungible money argument; and
                    they did not “want their money to help that treacherous Egypt.” I said to Al
                    Sudairi, “You just have to tell them that the objections can only be on
                    technical grounds. Political objections are not acceptable in an international
                    organization. If Libyans and Iraqis can demonstrate technical deficiencies with
                    this project, fine. Of course, they couldn't control themselves at the Board
                    meeting, saying that the Sadat government was not the legitimate government of
                    the Egyptian people, he was a traitor, and on and on. Al Sudairi called them out
                    of order and the loan for Egypt was approved by the Board.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Then the loan for Cuba came up. I told the US representative “If you can
                    demonstrate that this project technically is not sound, okay, but otherwise it's
                    going to be approved just as the loan to Egypt was approved. Because there's no
                    way we can stop it. And he said, “Well, you might be out of a job.” I replied,
                    “We can't have it both ways in an international organization, one shouldn't play
                    politics.” I remember the Cuban project involved growing vegetables outside of
                    Havana. It might have been different if it was a dam, but it was a very simple
                    project, and almost impossible to shoot down the project technically. I got a
                    lot of bad vibes when I went back to Washington but I said, “We didn't let them
                    block the Egyptian project on political grounds,” so we couldn't block the Cuban
                    project on political grounds.</p>
                <p>Then, the World Bank came to IFAD to cofinance a project for Vietnam. The
                    gentleman who was promoting the project, Shahid Husain, is still in the World
                    Bank. When I went there to work many years later, he said, “I still remember
                    you. You talked Al Sudairi out of doing our project in Vietnam.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, you're giving me more credit than I deserve.” The Bank was going
                    into Vietnam, after South Vietnam fell, and Husain described the project, he
                    wanted IFAD to cofinance. We did a lot of cofinancing with World Bank and with
                    other IFI's. The project was basically a heavy equipment drop: road graders, and
                    D-8s. I was surprised, because I thought the US military had probably left
                    hundreds of those behind when they pulled out. I asked, “Who is going to be
                    receiving the equipment?” And he explained that the Vietnamese had these
                    collective farms, which would receive the equipment. I knew Al Sudairi and the
                    OPEC people didn't like collective farms. Furthermore, the lending criteria for
                    IFAD, called for helping small farmers. So big, earth moving equipment was not
                    IFAD priority. Then we asked, “Are you going to be able to put the technicians
                    on the ground?” Husain said, “No, they don't want any foreign technicians. They
                    don't need any help like that, they just want the equipment.” Al Sudairi said,
                    “I think that from what we've heard, this is not a project for IFAD.” And we
                    didn't do anything in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>So it was very interesting being in an international organization, and trying to
                    make sure that it functioned as an international organization, on an objective
                    non-political basis. It was a great experience, in particular because we built
                    the organization from scratch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about its development? Was that different from others,
                        or was there anything particularly unique about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Well, IFAD did try to do something different. The objective was to work
                    with small poor farmers and the rural poor. A cost benefit analysis on these
                    projects often indicated a poor rate of return. For example, IFAD did a project
                    in a remote part of Honduras where there's very few farm to market roads, a very
                    difficult place to work. IFAD did buy into cofinancing some big irrigation
                    projects in Pakistan or India. We were preaching this “religion” or new approach
                    of first finding the target group, i.e. the poor farmers, then analyze their
                    situation, and how IFAD could make an intervention that would improve their
                    living standards. There were some good examples of that. In the Gambia, women
                    are farmers, but often they get the worst land, marsh land that is under water
                    most of the time. IFAD did a project for these women, which involved draining
                    the land and putting in a very simple irrigation. It was a big success, and the
                    next thing we heard was that the men came and kicked the women off the land,
                    because now this was good land. So we had to go back and tell the government
                    that this was just not acceptable. There was a big discussion, but IFAD
                    prevailed and the women remained on the land.</p>
                <p>What was also interesting was that the fact that IFAD was a tripartite
                    organization — I think the OPEC partners learned a lot. They had to sit on the
                    board and they had to review these projects. The OPEC representatives mainly
                    wanted to see what was happening to their money, and they had political
                    concerns. It was quite an education to see how they looked at projects, given
                    the different perspective and objective of the OPEC representatives. A lot of
                    people were very much concerned that decisions would be taken by votes. However,
                    as in other IFI's, most decisions were realized by consensus. In the five years
                    I was there we seldom got to a position where there was a huge disagreement and
                    we'd have to take a vote. If we had to vote, the industrialized countries would
                    have lost, because OPEC and the developing countries had two-thirds of the vote.
                    So it turned out that the structure was workable. Although on the Hill, some
                    people remained upset about the unequal burden sharing. On the other hand, IFAD
                    developed quite a following on the Hill. We had some good publicity in terms of
                    spreading IFAD's message. IFAD was in the forefront of supporting the basic
                    human needs, and enjoyed the reputation of being poverty conscious, i.e. helping
                    small farmers and the rural poor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding was that IFAD wasn't supposed to
                        implement its programs because of a small staff, and it worked through
                        others, something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes. Limiting the size of the organization was another concern. The
                    Articles of Agreement called for project appraisals to be done by the World
                    Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development, and/or the
                    InterAmerican Development Bank. IFAD would do cofinancing and we would ask the
                    other institutions to administer the loans. The idea was to keep the staff
                    small. Obviously if you're cofinancing an ongoing project, or a project that's
                    already been designed, it's pretty hard to change its objectives or target
                    group. So we had to be very selective as to which projects were going to meet
                    IFAD's small farmer criteria. But after that we identified our own projects, and
                    then had another multilateral bank appraise them.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Later, the World Bank was starting to cofinance some of the projects initiated by
                    IFAD. I was given the responsibility to negotiate the fees to be paid by IFAD
                    for these appraisals, so we went to see the people in the Asian Development
                    Bank. Their Vice President in charge of management said, “Well, we are going to
                    be appraising agricultural projects and the cost really depends on the kind of
                    project and can vary enormously. He said, “We're not going to get involved in
                    time recording. It's too cumbersome, and there are always arguments about
                    differences between direct costs and indirect costs. Let's come up with a fixed
                    price, and just make it easy. I said, “Yes, great. What would you have in mind?”
                    He said, “Oh, $250,000.00 per appraisal.” I figured that was a bargain. He said,
                    “I realize that's a very low price. We'll win some and lose some, but we're not
                    in this to make money.”</p>
                <p>The next organization we negotiated with was the World Bank. Ernie Stern was the
                    Senior Vice President for Operations and he was very helpful - agreeing to
                    second some Bank people to IFAD. We needed a comptroller and Treasury type. We
                    had millions of dollars to invest, because the OPEC countries made their
                    contributions in cash, whereas, the US and other industrialized countries gave
                    promissory notes. Next, I said to Ernie, “OKAY, now, we need your help to
                    prepare appraisals. I just negotiated an agreement with the Asian Development
                    Bank, and they decided to make life easy and agreed to a fixed price for an
                    appraisal.”</p>
                <p>Stern said, “That sounds reasonable.” I said, “OKAY, what do you think the fee
                    should be?” I had a feeling Ernie was going to say more that $250,000.00. But
                    before he could respond, one of his assistants said, “Excuse me, we have the
                    best time recording system in the world. We can calculate exactly what the costs
                    are, and I don't think we should agree on a fixed price.” I said, “Are you sure
                    you want to do it that way?” And they said, “Yes, we've installed a new system.
                    It's cost us a lot of money.”</p>
                <p>I went to work for the World Bank, almost eight years after that meeting, and
                    they were still disputing costs of appraisals with IFAD, based on their time
                    recordings. It was a lesson in how one can make life more complicated than it
                    needs to be.</p>
                <p>I would like to say something about IFAD's funding. Initially the funding was for
                    three years - 1978-1980. Category I or the industrialized countries pledged $606
                    million and Category II, the OPEC countries, pledged $435 million for a total of
                    $1,041 million, resulting in a 57/43 ratio between Category I and Category II
                    contributions. The US contribution was $200 million or 20% of the total funding.
                    I worked on the first replenishment.</p>
                <p>The first replenishment covered the period 1981-1983. In January 1982, agreement
                    was reached on a replenishment target of $1,100 million as follows: Category I,
                    $620 million; Category II, $450 million; and Category III, $30 million.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The US was still very much concerned with attaining the 50/50 ratio between OPEC
                    and the industrialized countries. Therefore, the US felt that the industrialized
                    countries' contribution should be limited to $450 million and ,accordingly,
                    reduced its first replenishment pledge to $180 million.</p>
                <p>The Europeans were not insisting on equal shares or contributions from the OPEC
                    countries and were willing to provide increased financing because they felt IFAD
                    was effectively helping small farmers and the rural poor.</p>
                <p>When the Shah of Iran was deposed, the issue of matching contributions became in
                    a sense academic. Iran's initial pledge for IFAD was $125 million and at the
                    time of the Shah's departure only 10% or $125 million had been paid in. Iran has
                    not paid the rest of its pledge and has not participated in any replenishments.
                    Furthermore, Iraq and Libya were delinquent in their payments and the financial
                    position of other OPEC contributors, e.g. Nigeria and Venezuela have
                    deteriorated. Consequently, over the years, IFAD has faced increasing
                    difficulties in mobilizing adequate replenishments and its level of operations
                    has decreased markedly.</p>
                <p>To sum up, my IFAD experience was unique. First, I was involved in negotiating
                    its Articles of Agreement, next in building the staff and organizational
                    structure from scratch, and lastly, in helping develop a large number of
                    effective small farmer projects in many developing countries.</p>
                <p>Return to Washington and the Wheeler Group on Africa - 1983</p>
                <p>I returned from IFAD to Washington in 1983. Mr. Peter McPherson was the AID
                    Administrator. It was difficult to find an appropriate job for me, so I became
                    his special assistant. There was an informal inter-agency coordination group for
                    Sub-Saharan Africa called the Wheeler Group, which Joe Wheeler had chaired. I
                    was named its chairman in 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a former Deputy Administrator ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Right. This was an informal interagency group consisting of State, AID,
                    DOD, NSC, and the EX-IM Bank, with the objective of improving the coordination
                    of US policy in Africa. One of our major preoccupations in 1983 was Sudan. Sudan
                    had a huge debt problem. I think even at that time they owed the IMF almost $1
                    billion, and they had a total debt of at least $5-6 billion with a level of debt
                    servicing, that they just couldn't handle. We were trying to work out a major
                    assistance package tied to reforms. General Numeri was in charge. He was from
                    the North, a Muslim, but he had held out the olive branch to the South to end
                    the civil war in Sudan. So he was considered to be a possible savior, and there
                    was a great interest in trying to get the Sudanese to undertake economic policy
                    reforms, and then to mobilize the necessary resources. I remember a lot of time
                    was spent on that program. We would get them to agree on a reform program, but
                    soon they were off track. And then the Sudanese would say, “OKAY, we're
                    performing now, come up with the money to keep us on track with the IMF.”
                    However, the resources just weren't there. In a perverse way it was a mixed
                    blessing that they were not performing, because we could not mobilize the donors
                    to provide the huge amounts of money required. Again, it was the traditional
                    kind of situation where the IMF was expecting the bilateral donors to come up
                    with the money to get Sudan back on track and bail out the IMF. I remember
                    someone in the NSC arguing that because Sudan was very important in the Middle
                    East peace negotiations, why don't we allocate all the USAID assistance
                    earmarked for Africa to that “strategically important country”? Unfortunately,
                    the problems still persist in Sudan at present.</p>

                <p>The next thing I worked on was a proposal for a new US initiative for Sub-Saharan
                    Africa to provide balance of payments assistance in support of policy reforms.
                    The Wheeler Group proper name was the Interagency Working Group on the African
                    Economic Crisis. Most of the African countries in the early 1980's were in an
                    economic free fall. They suffered almost a decade of low per capita growth,
                    agricultural production was down, and social services were deteriorating. The
                    economies of most of the countries were in a very bad way. AID and State
                    prepared a memo for the Secretary to send to the President indicating that the
                    African economies were terribly over-managed, with over-valued currencies,
                    negative interest rates and suffering from “statism.” Unless the economic policy
                    framework was improved, with greater reliance on prices and markets, there would
                    be very little growth, and the conditions would get worse. To encourage the
                    countries to make these policy reforms, IMF and the World Bank had started
                    adjustment programs and we recommended that the US should push them further in
                    this area, and that we should be providing, as part of our aid program, balance
                    of payments assistance, or non-project assistance in support of adjustment. The
                    paper was called the US Economic Policy Initiative for Sub-Saharan Africa, and
                    it explicitly called for the provision of nonproject aid in support of
                    macroeconomic policy reforms. At first, we started out by suggesting something
                    like $500 million per year of US aid for this program would be required for the
                    number of countries to be supported. The final draft requested $500 million for
                    a 5-year period, and in the first year we were not even seeking $100 million,
                    but $75 million. So it gives you some idea of the budget constraints at the
                    time. This Economic Policy Initiative finally evolved into the Development Fund
                    for Africa, which resulted in a line item earmarked for Africa, out of which
                    nonproject and project assistance was financed. That was really how I spent my
                    time, which was just about one year, working for Mr. McPherson in the front
                    office. Then I went back to the African Region for just about a year as Deputy
                    Assistant Administrator, working on East and Southern Africa. In March 1985, I
                    retired and joined the World Bank.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing on East and Southern Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I represented the Africa Bureau at CG meetings for East and South
                    African countries. There was concern about how do we mobilize more concessional
                    debt relief together with development assistance. The whole business of getting
                    the economic framework right in African countries was a major concern. Initially
                    the Economic Policy Initiative was not received very well in some quarters on
                    the Hill. I remember one time going up there with Princeton Lyman, who later was
                    the US Ambassador to Nigeria. Princeton was then working in the Africa Bureau in
                    State, backstopping aid programs. He and I went up to meet with the staff on the
                    Hill who did not see the connection between basic human needs and balance of
                    payments assistance and felt that adjustment or economic reform programs hurt
                    the poor. We were trying to point out that in certain countries the things had
                    gotten so bad that there were no consumer goods or wage goods in these
                    countries. I made a trip to Ghana in 1983 and called on the AID people in Ghana.
                    They were telling me that they had to pay the local people in kind. They were
                    paying them with bags of rice and cakes of soap, because there was nothing to
                    buy in the economy.</p>
                <p>We were trying to explain to the Hill staff members that the objectives of the
                    macroeconomic reform programs were to correct the bias against the rural sector,
                    to increase agricultural prices and to get competitive exchange rates. The money
                    was being used to finance basic imports and raw materials that the economy
                    needed to get going, and balance of payments assistance was helping a
                    cross-section of the population. But there was quite a bit of resistance and
                    many staffers felt that we should be concentrating on health and education, and
                    this balance of payments assistance should be provided by the Fund and the Bank.
                    It took a number of years to make that breakthrough on getting support for
                    adjustment assistance. When I decided to retire in 1985 and I moved over to the
                    Bank, I went to work on the exact same problems.</p>
                <p>Retired from AID in 1985 Worked in the World Bank on the Special Facility for
                    Africa and Special Program of Assistance (SPA)</p>
                <p>When I got to the Bank, they had set up what was called the Special Facility for
                    Africa. It's amazing how certain problems reoccur in cycles. The Reagan
                    Administration would not agree to the IDA VIII replenishment level, which was
                    considered too high for the US It actually had been partially negotiated and
                    therefore the Europeans had put sufficient money in their budgets for a higher
                    IDA level, but the US wouldn't go along. So the Europeans and the Japanese set
                    up something called the Special Facility for Africa, and the funds was turned
                    over to IDA to make soft loans to African countries in support of adjustment
                    programs. Because the US wouldn't participate, the other donors agreed that the
                    US would not be eligible for procurement in this Special Facility. Now, the same
                    thing is happening. The US is delinquent in its payments to IDA X, and is going
                    to be at least a year late. IDA donors have agreed on a level for IDA XI, and
                    then they have to fund an interim year between IDA X and IDA XI. So the IDA
                    contributors have decided to fund the interim year's program, in which the US
                    will not participate, but will just try to catch up in its delinquent payments.
                    Again, it has been proposed that the US will not be eligible for procurement
                    under this interim arrangement. So this is the second time it's happened.</p>

                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We never contributed to the Special Facility for
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: No, that was very interesting. Congress found out that there were no
                    ground rules in terms of burden sharing, i.e. as to what amount you had to put
                    into this Special Facility for Africa to be eligible to participate. Congress,
                    on its own, without a special request from the Executive Branch, appropriated
                    $150 million and the US became eligible for procurement against almost $2
                    billion of resources in this Special Facility for Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't an interest in Africa at that time in the
                        Administration to really do anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: We're talking about 1983-85; there was not a particular strong US
                    interest in Africa. AID did get the African Development Fund. There was a small
                    group of people always working for Africa on the Hill, but I don't think there
                    was any general support. The World Bank's Special Facility for Africa was
                    mobilizing balance of payments assistance to support the adjustment programs in
                    Africa. And that lasted about a year and a half. Then the Development Committee
                    asked the World Bank and the IMF to come with a special program, for poor
                    African countries that had major debt problems. As a result, the Bank proposed
                    this Special Program of Assistance (SPA). It started in 1988 and it's now
                    completing its third phase. These are three year cycles, so it's been running
                    about 9 years. It that turned out to be a unique regional aid coordination
                    mechanism for providing balance of payments assistance and, by 1993-94, 31
                    Sub-Saharan African countries were declared eligible to receive this
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the eligibility requirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The eligibility requirements were that the country was “poor.” That
                    meant any country which was eligible to receive IDA assistance. Two: that it had
                    a debt service ratio of at least 30 percent during the initial period, 1988-90,
                    and the third requirement was that the country was implementing an adjustment
                    program, which was supported by the IMF and the World Bank. My job was to manage
                    the SPA meetings and to help mobilize bilateral donor participation in this
                    program. We were very successful. There are 14 bilateral donors, including all
                    the major bilateral donors, as well as the European Community, the African
                    Development Bank, the World Bank, and the IMF. During the period 1988-1996 about
                    $45 billion in balance of payments debt relief was mobilized. About $15 billion
                    came from the bilateral donors, and about $15 billion in concessional debt
                    relief was mobilized; the IMF put in about $4 billion, and the World Bank about
                    $10 billion. This was quick disbursing balance of payments assistance, which
                    financed general imports, including consumption and intermediate goods, raw
                    materials, and supported macroeconomic reform. It was the same type of program
                    that we recommended in the Wheeler Group, and supported under the US Economic
                    Policy Initiative that we prepared for Secretary Shultz.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The SPA donors had meetings every six months and reviewed whether the recipient
                    countries were on track with their adjustment programs, and we also monitored
                    how well the donors were doing in committing and disbursing their funds. If you
                    are trying to cover balance of payments deficits, your disbursements have to be
                    on a timely basis, otherwise you don't maintain the import levels required for
                    investment and growth. It was a joint effort called a partnership. It was quite
                    a unique aid coordination arrangement, having some many bilateral donors
                    assisting so large a number of countries.</p>
                <p>As you know, the adjustment programs came under a lot of criticism. They often
                    used the word structural adjustment, which I think is kind of confusing because
                    there were two parts to the program. One part was concerned with policy reforms.
                    I don't really think one can debate about the importance of a competitive
                    foreign exchange rate, removing trade barriers; positive interest rates, and not
                    taxing farmers to the point that it's not in their interest to produce, because
                    of the low returns. Market-oriented policies are essential for improving
                    investment and production; no matter what kind of economic ideology you have -
                    communist, socialist, or capitalist.</p>
                <p>The other part of the program was concerned with structural reforms or
                    institutional reforms. Getting rid of the parastatals, either privatizing them,
                    or establishing some levels of efficiency, reforming the civil service, which in
                    many countries were overstaffed, strengthening the banking and financial
                    sectors, improving the regulatory and legal systems, so as to encourage foreign
                    and local investment.</p>
                <p>There was much more success in terms of implementing the macroeconomic policy
                    reforms than there was on the structural side; addressing the problem of the
                    parastatals, civil service reforms, and financial sector reforms. Unfortunately,
                    there wasn't very much private investment, either domestic or foreign.</p>
                <p>In evaluating the adjustment programs, one has to look at what were the problems
                    at the time? Most African countries, because of the bad policies and poor
                    management, had huge balance of payments deficits, also large budget deficits,
                    resulting in very high rates of inflation and low production. The balance of
                    payments deficits of the countries which were implementing adjustment programs,
                    were covered fairly well by SPA in mobilizing the $45 billion of balance of
                    payments assistance. The real issue turned on the budget deficits. The complaint
                    was the adjustment programs were stabilization programs, and that the reduction
                    of the budget deficits focused on the poor because what often got cut were the
                    health and education programs in many countries. Now, in terms of what should be
                    cut, the World Bank, and the bilateral donors no doubt would have preferred, for
                    example, to see parastatals losses reduced, because that was a huge budget
                    drain, and reduced military expenditures, rather than cuts in social services,
                    but the recipient countries are sovereign.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I just made a presentation on behalf of DOD to some African military officers,
                    and I checked expenditures for the military in Africa. In 1993, ODA total flows
                    worldwide, that is official assistance, was about $55 billion. Africa got about
                    one-third of that amount or about $18 billion. Sub-Saharan Africa spent almost
                    $102 billion on military expenditures in 1993 or almost six times the level of
                    ODA. So in reducing these budget deficits, there were plenty of opportunities to
                    cut military expenditures or to cut the losses of the parastatals in many
                    African countries. Just like the debate we have in this country, what do you
                    cut? Medicare, or do you cut subsidies to the shipping industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the defense budget.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: That's right. It's also interesting — the military sales to Africa by
                    industrialized countries is currently about $36 billion a year, so it's a
                    multiple of what they are getting in aid. A lot of it came from the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's sort of self-defeating if we're providing balance of
                        payments aid on one hand, and selling them military equipment on the
                        other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: In evaluating the adjustment programs, it is also very important to
                    point out that there was a limited number of countries that consistently
                    implemented their adjustment programs. A lot of adjustment programs were off
                    track very often. If you're going to get the beneficial effect, for example,
                    from exchange rate reform, it has to be implemented over a number of years, and
                    with some consistency. In those countries which did implement the macroeconomic
                    policy reforms over four or five or six years, with some consistency, their
                    economic performance was a hell of a lot better than the off-track countries.
                    Ghana, Malawi, Uganda, and Mali are examples of good performances. Those
                    countries showed much higher levels of growth and much higher export levels. So
                    there is significant evidence that if you follow the good policies consistently,
                    you do get results.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Now, another problem was, what kind of results did they get? What kind of a
                    supply response? Many of these African countries did not get the kind of supply
                    response we saw in the Asian countries, like 7-8 percent growth per annum. They
                    only got 3-5 percent growth, and if you have an annual population growth rate of
                    3 percent, that doesn't leave you very much per capita growth. The net impact in
                    terms of poverty reduction was very little. So many people were saying, “what
                    have the adjustment programs accomplished, even if those that were implemented
                    on a regular basis didn't show all that much growth?” The problem in Africa was
                    getting the policies right was a necessary but not a sufficient condition. The
                    reason why they didn't get dynamic, robust supply responses was because of the
                    institutional weaknesses. The lack of trained manpower, weak infrastructure,
                    weak banking system, etc. A number of institutional changes were still at the
                    beginning stage for getting a strong supply response. I don't think you can
                    fault the economic policies. It was the poor implementation of the policies, and
                    furthermore policy reforms without structural reforms could not make a dent in
                    terms of poverty reduction.</p>
                <p>If you want to get poverty reduction, then you've got to get per capita growth
                    rates of 3-4 percent, which means annual growth rates of 7-8 percent. In Africa,
                    that's still a major problem. SPA is useful, because it provides a dialogue
                    between the bilateral donors and the World Bank on the broader aspects of
                    development, including how to accelerate growth and reduce poverty. Adjustment
                    programs have to be concerned with the social impact, so efforts are being made
                    to build in safety nets, undertake poverty assessments, and address gender
                    issues. SPA subcommittees were set up to study these issues, and there was a lot
                    of give and take, and aid programs are beginning to reflect these changes.</p>
                <p>SPA is an effective AID coordination mechanism with all the major bilateral
                    donors and international organizations participating in a single forum which
                    addresses the key development issues facing Sub Saharan countries. One donor
                    described SPA as “the crown jewel of aid coordination.”Q: Did African officials
                    participate in the SPA meetings?</p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: No, this was a donor group. However, at the beginning of each SPA
                    biannual meeting, we invited African Ministers, usually from Finance and Plan to
                    address the SPA donors. I guess we've covered about 15 countries now. They would
                    come for half a day, and the Ministers would make a presentation on their views
                    of adjustment programs, how effective they are and what the problems are. There
                    was a good interchange. And I must say there's been a great transformation, and
                    a growing consensus between African leaders and donors on key issues. When we
                    started in 1987-88, there was still a basic ideological difference. The Soviet
                    Union was still going strong, and there were many Africans who felt that state
                    planning was the way to go, with little reliance on market mechanisms.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>One of the points that the African ministers usually made was the importance of
                    these adjustment programs reflecting African ownership; that they are African
                    programs. The other point they were making in terms of ownership was that there
                    was a need to communicate internally to their own people the objectives and
                    requirements of these programs. A lot of them admitted that an insufficient
                    communication effort was made, that adjustment was just something that high
                    level people in the government discussed with the Fund and the Bank and the
                    bilateral donors. There was very little effort to communicate it down to the
                    people. The other thing the Ministers were always stressing was the fact that
                    one had to be flexible about speed or the rate at which some of these structural
                    reforms were put through. It was very hard to fire 7,500 people in the civil
                    service when you have an unemployment rate of 15-20 percent. They were looking
                    for budgetary assistance in working out some kind of safety nets. Although they
                    were saying we need to make the adjustment programs more flexible, most of them
                    felt that these kinds of policy changes were necessary to turn their economies
                    around.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest policy turning points was the devaluation of the CFA franc.
                    The CFA countries were in the SPA program, but they were getting very little
                    adjustment assistance because the Bank and the Fund were in a dialogue with them
                    about devaluing for about four years. CFA countries had decided that was not the
                    way they wanted to go and were trying to make their economies competitive by
                    deflating the economy, trying to push wages and prices down internally, so that
                    they could compete in the international markets. And of course, it wasn't
                    working, and the economies were sliding backward. So in January 1994, the CFA
                    franc countries undertook a major, 50 percent devaluation. It's interesting to
                    see, even though only a year or so has gone by, that their economies, especially
                    Cote D'Ivoire and the Cameroons, are starting to respond favorably.</p>
                <p>There is a growing acceptance by African leaders and economists, that you have to
                    make these policy changes. You can have some major difference of opinion with
                    regard to the speed of these changes.</p>
                <p>To some degree trying to continue these programs and dialogue in Africa, after
                    the French experience this last winter, is difficult. The French government
                    announced they would cut back on the subsidies and significantly reduce the
                    number of employees in the French national railroad and the national airline.
                    There was a huge strike, and the French government had to back down. What this
                    points out that there has to be a dialogue as to how fast you're going to make
                    these policy changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the SPA ever cut off from those countries that were
                        not complying?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Only a couple of countries were cut off — Somalia and Zaire. Somalia
                    because of the civil war, and Zaire because of a complete lack of performance.
                    In a lot of countries, it was stop and go with regard to implementing their
                    adjustment programs. One of the complaints by the ministers was that donors have
                    to avoid stop and go in aid flows, which undermined their efforts to get the
                    program back on track. In the same adjustment operation you have some policy
                    changes and some institutional changes required. Often the country made some
                    progress on the policy changes but they didn't make the institutional changes,
                    which were difficult, and then donors stopped the flow of balance of payments
                    assistance, which undermine the policy changes. For example, it was terribly
                    important to have adequate levels of foreign exchange, if you wanted to maintain
                    an open foreign exchange market, where the government didn't ration it, and
                    importers could get whatever foreign exchange they needed. There were a number
                    of countries which had a bad record of following the program one year and then
                    coming off track in the next year: Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the donors do their part? Often you get countries to
                        conform and then the donors don't ever quite come through the levels or the
                        speed at which ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Overall, SPA donors disbursement performance was very good. About 80%
                    of the funds pledged were disbursed within each three year period. Some donors,
                    the Japanese, for example, would follow the Bank and the Fund policy pretty
                    closely. When the Bank and the Fund declared certain countries off track, and
                    were not releasing a second or third tranche, the Japanese would stop their
                    disbursements. Other donors said, “We want you to keep up the dialogue, but we
                    really think if we cut off all the flows, we are really making the situation
                    worse.”</p>
                <p>But at some point, you must take action against poor performers. For a while
                    Tanzania was the darling of the Scandinavian countries, and they tolerated poor
                    performance. But it got to the point where even the Scandinavians said, “This is
                    taking too long” and substantially reduced their assistance to Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French support SPA and the CFA devaluation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The French were active in SPA. The French did not agree that the CFA
                    franc countries should devalue and they continued to provide their adjustment
                    assistance. But the Fund and the Bank took a pretty hard line — no devaluation;
                    no quick disbursing funding. Very few of the other bilateral donors put money
                    into French-speaking West Africa. In the end, the French did support the CFA
                    devaluation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the European Community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: In the Community, they had one or two strong individuals who managed
                    the Community's non-project balance of payments assistance. They supported the
                    Bank's and Fund's position on the CFA franc devaluation. With regard to
                    conditionality in adjustment programs, the EC was in favor of allowing greater
                    flexibility in implementing policy reforms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the US in this process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The US was in favor of selectivity and felt that countries should
                    implement their programs. When Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia were off track, the
                    US did not disburse. In Kenya, the US, along with several other donors, withheld
                    disbursements because of human rights abuses and corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there issues about the donors' policies in terms of
                        the import programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: That was a very important issue. I must emphasize that a lot of the
                    success for the SPA program goes to Kim Jaycox, who was the Vice President for
                    Africa in the World Bank. He chaired the SPA meetings and provided outstanding
                    leadership. When we were setting SPA up, some people said, why don't we
                    establish some ground rules at the outset for the type of assistance that would
                    be acceptable. Should it be untied, and should we try to have some simplified
                    procurement and disbursement rules? The Bank had a system of retroactive
                    financing of imports that had already taken place, and the only verification was
                    to spot check customs documentation to ensure what was imported was eligible
                    under the loan agreement. Many donors were concerned with value for money, so
                    they ran their own commodity import programs, where they managed the procurement
                    and disbursements according to their regulations. We said, “This is very
                    bizarre. We're telling the recipient countries that they are over managing their
                    economies, and are administering the allocation of foreign exchange and credit,
                    setting prices, etc., which is very inefficient. They should let the market do
                    it.” Yet in delivering their aid, donors didn't practice what they preached.
                    They were administering this aid, and not letting the market decide.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Mr. Jaycox handled this problem by saying, “Let's get started. All types of
                    balance of payments aid are acceptable.” And I remember he used the phrase, “We
                    will take apples, oranges, bicycles, anything. And once we get started, we'll
                    discuss how to improve the quality of this assistance.” So we set up a SPA
                    working group on improving the quality of import financing, which developed a
                    set of guidelines. The guidelines recommended that in countries liberalizing
                    their economies, the donors should respond in kind and liberalize the import
                    financing. And it was the pressure of the group that made it work. I really
                    think if you tried on a one on one basis, with a bilateral donor, they would
                    have insisted on maintaining their own regulations. When the U.K. said they were
                    prepared to untie their assistance and to do retroactive financing, other donors
                    joined them. So it was the pressure of the group. Currently about 85 to 90% of
                    the balance of payments assistance is untied, and largely provided as
                    retroactive financing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the US?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes. Now, there is pressure to move in the other direction, i.e. tied
                    assistance, but I don't know how far that's gotten. At the very beginning of
                    SPA, the US even gave a few cash grants. Quite a bit of work was done on
                    improving import financing. It really was the chicken and the egg syndrome.
                    Donors said, “We run these commodity import programs because we have no
                    confidence that the recipient country has a market-driven allocation of foreign
                    exchange and there's very little accountability of the funds.” But as the
                    countries made the policy changes and demonstrated more accountability, the
                    donors responded in kind. So most of the donors are now doing retroactive
                    financing and letting the market determine the imports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that a major share of resources was from debt
                        relief?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: That was a major breakthrough of the SPA. Historically debt relief and
                    the debt problem was treated as a separate issue from that of mobilizing aid
                    from donors. It wasn't considered part of the development resource envelope and
                    one did not project “required amounts” of debt relief needed if the economy was
                    to grow. SPA recognized that negotiating debt relief is the responsibility of
                    the Paris Club.” However, under SPA for each of these three-year cycles, for all
                    the countries that were eligible, we made a projection of their balance of
                    payments requirements needed to reach a certain growth rate. We put together
                    these tables, they were called pink tables, because we used pink paper, which
                    would indicate the balance of payments requirements, and the types of resources
                    that could be mobilized, including debt relief. For all the SPA eligible
                    countries, we would show the debt relief at full amount eligible under the Paris
                    Club's current terms. We just assumed that the Trinidad terms would be applied
                    to all eligible countries and recommended even more liberal debt relief. The
                    concessionality increased as the Paris Club went from Trinidad to Toronto terms
                    to Naples terms. It was really a major breakthrough in helping to mobilize
                    concessional debt relief for poor African countries. Here again, Mr. Jaycox'
                    leadership was extremely important.</p>
                <p>The Paris Club sets the parameters, and then the borrower has to negotiate
                    bilaterally with each donor. And sometimes that succeeded, and sometimes it
                    didn't. Although there was quite a bit of debt relief, the arrears kept building
                    up. So there is a major debt overhang, despite all this debt relief, which has
                    not been fully addressed. Now there is a new initiative, by the Fund and the
                    Bank, not only to look at the remaining bilateral debt, but also the
                    multilateral debt, and to do more on the commercial debt relief.</p>
                <p>A major breakthrough in SPA was to include debt relief as a means of financing
                    the balance of payments gaps as part of overall development strategy. Ten or
                    fifteen years ago, this would have been heresy. As the Chairman, Mr. Jaycox,
                    repeatedly made the point that the purpose of bilateral aid is not to service
                    the debt, but to finance imports and growth. All monies are fungible. Therefore,
                    while we're saying we're financing imports, in effect we are enabling the
                    recipient countries to pay the debt. This is not what development assistance is
                    all about. There is a great deal of sympathy for that point of view, and Nordics
                    and the U.K. pushed very hard for more concessional debt relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the Bank prepared to reschedule its debt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: There is a new debt relief proposal. I don't know the details of the
                    proposal, but it was discussed by the Bank's Executive Board and got a favorable
                    reply. The IMF's Board, especially the Germans, the Japanese, and the French,
                    are not very pleased at what is being proposed. I believe that one of the
                    problems is that the IMF wants to be made whole, that is they want all
                    outstanding debt to the IMF to be paid. Somebody has to pay for this. Some have
                    suggested that the IMF should sell some gold, and in effect write off the IMF
                    debts by the profit they make on the sale of gold. The problem is that more
                    money is needed to service Bank and IMF debt. If the bilateral donors put up the
                    money in some common fund and it's all out of one budget, and the net result is
                    less bilateral aid, then there's no net gain for the African countries. I think
                    that's the danger. But I really don't know the details. They are supposed to
                    discuss this new initiative in the next Bank-Fund annual meeting.</p>

                    Africa? If you take a longer term perspective, what's happened in the last 15 to
                    20 years, and what's going to happen in the next 15 to 20 years, I think one can
                    be relatively optimistic, that things will improve in Africa.</p>
                <p>Let me start off by saying the most important thing in development, in my view,
                    is participation. You have to have people, the average person, the small farmer
                    and businessman, participating in both the economy and in the political system.
                    In the economy, that means markets that work. We know markets are not perfect,
                    but when people have ready and open access to foreign exchange, credit, and
                    services, that's a far superior system than when the government administers the
                    economy. You get results when average people can participate. We've seen this
                    with individual farmers vis a vis collective farms. I remember a trip to
                    Mozambique in 1983. At that time, they were beyond communism. They were Maoists.
                    However, the government people said, “We make a mistake when we took the limited
                    foreign exchange we had to buy fertilizer, pesticides, and we gave it to
                    collective farms run by bureaucrats, who didn't know what the hell they were
                    doing, and they produced nothing. If we had given these same resources to the
                    individual farmers, we'd have gotten real production, because they know how to
                    farm.” That is the kind of participation, I have in mind.</p>
                <p>You also have to have an open political system, where people can participate in
                    the sense that there is an opposition, and a press to discuss policy options. If
                    the policies are not going right, people should have a voice to make changes.
                    Whether it's a bilateral donor, or a multilateral development bank, in my view,
                    we should not be working in any country where there isn't an open economy, and
                    an open political system, otherwise you are wasting your money.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The World Bank is promoting good governance, improving accountability and
                    transparency, but says it cannot get involved in calling for political reforms.
                    However, if there is a one-party system, and one man is in power for 20 or 30
                    years, and there's no opposition, then there's no accountability. He's
                    accountable to nobody. So we are kidding ourselves that there's going to be
                    efficiency and no corruption, if there's one man in power for 20-30 years.
                    There's no way of checking him when there is no opposition.” So you really can't
                    separate good economic management from political liberalization. Lord Acton was
                    right when he wrote, “Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
                    absolutely.”</p>
                <p>I am, however, optimistic that the current progress in economic and political
                    liberalism in African countries will continue and accelerate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can take that back to Tunisia, because in Tunisia at
                        the time you were there, I don't know what's happened since, they were doing
                        quite well, in a one-party system, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Although Tunisia had a one party system, President Bourguiba was
                    relatively honest. It was a meritocracy. They did let young, competent people
                    come to the top. They didn't have a landed aristocracy. Somebody said that
                    history has a very strange way of handling things. A very capable guy, like
                    Bourguiba gets to be the head of a tiny country, and an incompetent guy, like
                    Chiang Kai-shek, gets to be head of China, one of the most potentially powerful
                    countries in the world. So maybe Bourguiba was a philosopher king and therefore
                    one-man party rule worked. But when we see Mobutu in Zambia, corrupt to the
                    core, or in Tanzania, Nyerere wasn't corrupt, but not willing to have a
                    discussion of options, you see the value of participation and an opposition
                    party.</p>
                <p>Another major factor for development is the expansion of trade and investment.
                    and the role of the private sector in the economy. To get private investment,
                    you have to have a stable political system, and an effective macroeconomic
                    framework. The success of the Asian countries and Latin American economies is
                    due in large part to the private sector, both the local and the foreign private
                    sector. You will not attract foreign investment and accelerate growth, unless
                    you have the right environment, a transparent legal and regulatory framework, an
                    open economy, which allows the people to develop.</p>
                <p>Look at Ghana. It's a relative success story in implementing its adjustment
                    programs. But there has been very little, relatively speaking, private foreign
                    investment, and local private investment. That's understandable because Rawlings
                    is still in charge. One day he sounds reasonable on private investment, and the
                    next day he might say, “I decided to nationalize everything again.” So why would
                    any good Ghanaian businessman risk his capital and energy - instead he moves his
                    money offshore. It will take years before they have confidence that Ghana is an
                    open economy, and that it's going to remain that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Uganda is now doing very well. Initially, Uganda drove out all the East Asians.
                    However, recently Uganda had about $2-3 billion in foreign investments because
                    some 7,000 Asian families have returned. They've returned with their capital,
                    and they are being accepted. The Uganda government liberalized the economy and
                    opened it up to foreign investment. This is terribly important because a country
                    is not going to develop relying only on foreign aid. At the present time, annual
                    direct foreign investment in developing countries is about four times greater
                    than the total annual aid flows. Unfortunately, Sub-Saharan Africa receives very
                    little of this foreign investment.</p>
                <p>The other thing that we neglected in Africa was the population problem. The East
                    Asian miracle countries over the last 20 years have reduced their population
                    growth rates to 1.5 percent-2.0 percent. If Africa continues at three percent
                    annual population growth rate; there's no way they are going to crack the
                    poverty problem. As we know, it's much more than a problem in terms of numbers
                    of people. They have education and health requirements and need jobs as new
                    entrants to the labor force. In Africa, there is a nexus between population,
                    environment, and agricultural production. They are tied together. When Africa
                    had low population growth rates, they could pursue subsistence agriculture, and
                    they could slash and burn, and it was tolerable. But now, with the population
                    pressure, people are moving on to marginal lands and there is a lot of
                    environmental degradation. You also have to improve the agricultural practices
                    and technology to keep up with the population growth rate.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, more attention is now being addressed in many African countries to
                    comprehensive family planning, including education of girls and maternal and
                    infant care.</p>
                <p>It's interesting, when foreign assistance first started in the 1950, and 60's,
                    there was a lot of emphasis on agriculture. In the 1980's, there was a lot of
                    attention on health and education, i.e. investment in human resources. That's
                    important, and it was a key in the development of Asian countries. In Africa
                    there's a need to rejuvenate our efforts in agriculture, because agriculture and
                    the rural development are the basis for growth and for reducing poverty. Rapid
                    agricultural growth provided the resources for industrialization in developed
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Another the reason why I'm relatively optimistic about Africa's future is because
                    the Cold War is over. If a country was not implementing these policy reforms, we
                    really didn't push very had, if they were on our side in the Cold War. Zaire is
                    a perfect example. Mobutu played this Cold War card very well, because he knew
                    what the score was. Furthermore, until the Cold War was over and the Soviet
                    Union fell, you had a lot of academicians in the US and in Europe, saying that
                    there's nothing wrong with statism and state planning, and that the market
                    economy leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of African leaders were paying lip
                    service to market policies and saw state planning as a viable alternative. It
                    was only when the Soviet Union collapsed and people saw how weak their economy
                    was, that they began accepting that you get greater efficiency of resources by
                    relying on the market.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>By the same token, the movement to a market economy from statism needs to be
                    gradual, properly sequenced. When I was an instructor at Columbia in 1957, we
                    used Samuelson's first economic textbook. He spoke of the American economy as
                    the mixed economy and never suggested that it was a completely free market
                    economy. One is struck by the fact that, whereas we accused the Russians as
                    being ideologues in state planning, we seem not to tolerate any deviation in
                    their movement to a market economy. We sound like ideologues in pushing free
                    enterprise and market mechanisms. We insist on immediate dismantling of
                    subsidies. If there's a labor redundancy in the Russian factories of 20-30
                    percent, we say just fire the guys. The idea is that the shock treatment is
                    better. I think that we've overdone it. We have a mixed economy. We have a hard
                    time getting rid of farm subsidies. We're not prepared to get rid of some of
                    these corporate subsidies. The same problem exists in Africa. How fast should or
                    can they proceed with major reforms and make the necessary transitions.</p>
                <p>Another area which needs improvement in Africa is aid coordination. SPA focused
                    on coordinating donor support for adjustment programs, but at most only 20
                    percent of the aid from the bilaterals and the multilaterals went into
                    nonproject assistance. Eighty percent of the aid was still financing projects.
                    The point is that the projects won't be very effective if the macroeconomic
                    policies are counterproductive.</p>
                <p>However, the way project aid is being provided is part of the problem, not the
                    solution, because of all the fragmentation caused by donor-driven projects. The
                    Bank did a review in Tanzania two or three years ago and found that there were
                    800 individual donor projects. So donors were competing and chasing limited
                    budget resources, and the limited number of trained people. The way a donor
                    handled this problem, if his project wasn't being implemented, was to set up a
                    project management unit, paid twice the going wage rate, and pull the best
                    people out of the civil service to run his project management unit, and the hell
                    with the rest. There's been a lot of discussion in SPA on how to best address
                    this problem.</p>
                <p>Attention is being focused on a country's public expenditure program, including:
                    both the investment and the recurring costs. The balance of payments, hopefully
                    will get corrected as exports are expanded and if we solve the debt problem. If
                    you're concerned about whether a country is doing enough in human resource
                    development; environmental protection; and infrastructure maintenance, the best
                    place to review all these items is in the public expenditure program. The Bank
                    conducts public expenditure reviews, but most of those reviews were on the
                    planning aspects, with very little review on the actual budget outturns. The
                    reason for that was that the outturns are likely to be two years late. But if we
                    had been doing this for the past 20 years, despite the late budget outturns,
                    we'd now have 20 years of experience on these outturns and a better idea of what
                    actually transpired.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>It has been recommended that the whole focus of foreign assistance ought to be on
                    the public expenditure program. It should be the country's program, and then
                    seek donors' support on agreed priorities. The British are experimenting in
                    Zambia supporting the public expenditure program, with time slices of funds not
                    related to a project or any particular operation, but to the overall performance
                    budget or public expenditure performance.</p>
                <p>Many other donors want to be aligned with certain sectors, for example public
                    health. So, they prefer the sector approach, where the government and donors
                    agree on policies and funding required for a specific sector. The public
                    expenditure program is made up of the individual sectors, so the sum of the
                    parts should equal the whole. The emphasis is strengthening public expenditure
                    programs and providing sector financing. One problems is to eliminate all those
                    old donor-financed projects that are not working. The Bank is closing down
                    projects which were Bank driven, and weren't going anyplace. Some donors,
                    particularly the French, are saying this coordinated sector approach is ganging
                    up by the donors. But I believe many Ministers would accept this approach if all
                    donors agreed on a sector program and supported it, and stop doing their own
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other ministers don't particularly like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes, because they want to solicit support from every donor possible,
                    even if it results in poor management and duplication. There is another
                    coordination problem. It is much easier to get donor coordination on
                    macroeconomic policy because bilateral donors are prepared to defer to the Fund
                    and the Bank on, for example, the appropriate exchange rate. But when it comes
                    to the sectors like health and education, and what the priorities should be,
                    there are a lot more differences among donors. If you are talking about an
                    infrastructure, like road construction, it's easier to coordinate. There is a
                    very comprehensive road program in Tanzania, which covers the whole country, and
                    donors have bought into it. They can fly their flag, and finance road A or B, as
                    long as it's still part of a comprehensive program. But when we get into sectors
                    like health, education, there are many more subjective judgments, whereas a road
                    is a road is a road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also involves the question of capacity to implement,
                        not just to decide a priority.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: In the past there was a lot of emphasis on financing the physical
                    projects, for example, a series of hospitals or clinics. The idea was the
                    recurrent costs, the salaries, the aspirins, and the Band-Aids, that was the
                    government's responsibility. Often, they didn't have sufficient resources to
                    handle these costs and the facilities were underused. Now, if we agree on a
                    sector program, not only investment requirements, but the recurrent costs are
                    also included. Donors are prepared to finance some of these costs if there is a
                    program to step up domestic revenues so that the donor assistance for recurrent
                    costs can be phased out. If you're really concerned about development and
                    poverty reduction, you should support the public expenditure program, and
                    provide the kind of resources they need. Donors came up with all these labels —
                    this is a capital project, this is technical assistance — all these little
                    boxes. And that's not the way the real world works. Efficient development needs
                    resources that are fungible. You want to emphasize output, and performance,
                    rather than measuring the inputs and managing the inputs with these nice little
                    labels that we came up with. It took us 20 or 30 years to adopt a more
                    comprehensive approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is the US assistance program in that reform
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I think AID would say, “We've been talking about sector programs for a
                    very long time,” US assistance programs have shown much more flexibility in
                    trying different things than a lot of other donors. I would like to point out
                    the differences between the World Bank and my experience in USAID. Until about
                    1987, when they had the reorganization, the Bank was primarily financing
                    projects. The guys who called the shots were the project managers: in power, in
                    water, and transport. There is a distinction between being a bank which looks
                    for bankable projects, and being a development institution. In the latter,
                    you're more concerned with institution building and training people in addition
                    to key policy issues. You can build a good farm to market road, but if the
                    agricultural pricing policy acts as a disincentive, very little production is
                    going to move along that road. AID, for a long time, has been aware of the need
                    for an integrated country approach. Starting in the '50s and '60s, AID field
                    mission developed a country program. Whether we succeeded all the time in
                    integrating all the elements was another thing. We were doing more than just
                    capital project financing. AID was involved in major institution and capacity
                    building and trained literally tens of thousands of people.</p>
                <p>I spent almost nine years in the World Bank. It was interesting because I could
                    make comparisons between AID and the multilateral institutions.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that struck me was that in an international financial
                    institution like the World Bank, all countries are members. As a member you have
                    entitlements and can tap the institution's resources. In a bilateral program
                    like AID, this is a matter of foreign policy and choice. We decide, on a
                    political basis and concern with economic objectives, who receives assistance
                    and which countries are excluded.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>When SPA was about to start up, Mr. Conable's well-known Congressional
                    Representative from upstate New York, was the head of the Bank. He made a
                    presentation at the Bank's annual meeting to the African governors. He
                    introduced the idea of a Special Program Assistance for African countries with
                    three criteria for eligibility. As mentioned before, to be eligible, you had to
                    be an IDA only country, have a major debt problem and implementing an adjustment
                    program supported by the IMF and the Bank. Almost to a man, African Governors
                    said, “No, you can't do that. You can't establish some additional criteria for
                    access to Bank funds. We are all eligible by being members of the Bank. Well,
                    despite these objections, SPA went forward and there is increasing recognition
                    of the need for more selectivity and providing assistance to good performers.
                    One of the biggest differences is in the operating style. The Bank is a
                    Washington headquarters centered organization, while AID and a number of the
                    other bilateral programs are field centered, and field operated. The Bank is now
                    talking about improved communication with the recipients and greater
                    participation by them — more country ownership. It is so much easier to do this
                    when you have a field mission with staff living in the country, working with
                    local people, than when you're a headquarters based organization. Even if you go
                    to the field every six months, it's still not the same thing. Because AID had
                    field missions, and the responsibility was in the field mission to develop the
                    program in country with their counterparts, I think we got a different kind of
                    program.</p>
                <p>In the Bank, when you ask certain people who is the client, the response was not
                    the recipient country, but the Executive Board. About 80% of the Bank's staff
                    time went into appraisal and the preparation of the President's Report to the
                    Board, to demonstrate that the project was technically and economically sound,
                    that the cash-flow was positive. Furthermore, the approach was, we'd identified
                    a bankable project, and now we turn it over to the borrower to implement. One
                    has to disaggregate the world. In Korea, Turkey, and Brazil today this is a
                    workable approach. In Africa, this was not a workable approach, because of the
                    lack of trained manpower, and weak institutions. A real effort is needed in
                    Africa in supervision and monitoring implementation, because what you presented
                    to the Board was just on paper, describing how it should go, and the reality in
                    the field often was quite different.</p>
                <p>Promotions largely depended on how many projects you brought to the Board, and
                    how well you did in presenting those projects. Little emphases or rewards were
                    given for being a good manager. In the last few years, the culture in the Bank
                    has been changing. There is a movement toward moving responsibility to field
                    missions. They do have field missions, but they still haven't given the Resident
                    Representative real authority. The Bank's country director in Washington is
                    trying to be both what we in AID would call the mission director and also the
                    chief Washington desk officer or country officer. However, in Mexico and in some
                    other countries, the Bank is trying an experiment — the country director is
                    resident full time in country.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>These are other differences. When they talk about pipeline in the Bank, they are
                    talking about pipeline of new projects. When when we talk about pipelines in
                    AID, we meant the undisbursed funds; the money in the pipeline. The Bank has an
                    allocation system for deciding what new funding would go to each country based
                    upon various performance criteria. During my first days in the Bank, I asked if
                    they included the amount of undisbursed funds? The answer I often got was, what
                    do disbursements prove? It's true, you can have a high rate of disbursements,
                    and still have a lousy project. But if you have a low rate of disbursements,
                    that's a red flag that something is wrong — either the design is wrong, or their
                    is a lack of communication. There was a laissez-faire attitude, some Bank
                    country directors would have a periodic review of the undisbursed amounts, and
                    identify the reasons. But I found it very strange that, in the main criteria for
                    allocating new funds, the pipeline of undisbursed funds was not given very high
                    priority. This too has changed in the last few years and much more attention is
                    being focused on undisbursed funds.</p>
                <p>Another thing that one has to take into account, is that in a bilateral
                    organization, there is basically one culture. People understand each other. A
                    senior official from the USDA, a very respected ag-economist, was in charge of
                    the Bank's technical department for agriculture, which backstopped all the
                    country desks for Africa. He related that, at his staff meetings, something like
                    10 different countries or nationalities were represented. He said “I thought I
                    was presenting something very simple in terms of program objectives and how I
                    wanted the department to operate.” He said he was amazed later how this was
                    interpreted, depending upon the person's culture. He thought he was saying
                    things that were pretty straightforward, but people would read very different
                    things into them. Effectively managing an institution, and to get a common
                    understanding when you have different cultures is quite a challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were talking about field missions. What do you
                        think are the particular merits of having field missions in AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The problem is that it is costly, which is one thing that bothers the
                    Bank. Furthermore, if the mission gets too big, maybe you had that experience in
                    Nigeria, it was happening in Tunisia when I was there, the administrative
                    support for the mission becomes an end in itself. You have to have a motor pool
                    officer and administrative officer. We also had great difficulty to get
                    technicians to work outside of Tunis, because the facilities weren't there - no
                    schools, no commissary, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Being stationed in the field helps you to understand something about the country,
                    something about the culture; and enables you to provide some direct and indirect
                    training and technical assistance. However, even when we had field missions, we
                    didn't always succeed in gaining this understanding. In contrast, someone in the
                    Bank was telling me that they put together a stabilization program for Chad, and
                    he wasn't sure how many people in the ministry understood what had to be done,
                    as it involved some fairly complicated policy changes. This was discussed over a
                    two week period, and the Bank technicians left. They were coming back in four to
                    six months to see what progress was made. What struck me was that those poor
                    guys in Chad needed for the Bank staff to stay there during the next four
                    months, and live through the daily problems the Chadians will have in
                    implementing the program, make on the spot adjustments with them. I couldn't
                    believe what he said, “We laid out a very good program for them, and it's up to
                    them to implement it.”</p>
                <p>I can't imagine that a hell of a lot of progress was made, because at that time,
                    the technical competence in Chad was not very strong.</p>
                <p>Another anecdote involves disbursement problems. The local people didn't always
                    properly prepare the withdrawal applications, required by the Bank to release
                    funds under a Bank loan. Some good loan disbursement officers were stationed by
                    the Bank in Nairobi, and in Abidjan. I understand that this made a big
                    difference. The loan officers were working the circuit, they were going around
                    to these different countries getting to know which people in the various
                    Ministries had to move which pieces of paper, and explaining Bank procedures and
                    disbursements improved substantially. Then I heard that the loan officer was
                    moved out of Abidjan. There was a big fight — whether he would be charged to the
                    Bank's West African Department's budget, or to the Bank's loan disbursement
                    department's budget, which was a central office. They couldn't agree, so the guy
                    was pulled out. To me it shows a lack of understanding of good management,
                    because I would have fired or transferred an economist or an engineer, if
                    necessary, and kept the loan office because with weak institutions and fairly
                    complicated disbursement procedures, you've got to make sure you have people out
                    there who can help manage the loan disbursements effectively.</p>
                <p>I believe Americans have a better concept of management. Some people would accuse
                    us of too much hands on. Supposedly in Vietnam, we worried more about the
                    potholes in the roads than the Vietnamese, and maybe that was true in Tunisia.
                    But we do have a certain concept of management and follow-up. In the World Bank,
                    not only are there various cultures, there are also a variety of missions. Parts
                    of the Bank are more like a university and hands-on management is not a top
                    priority.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Now there is a big effort to get better results from the field, participation by
                    the recipients and better management. Mr. Wolfenson, the Bank's president, is
                    making better management a key effort. They are sending 60 people to Harvard
                    Business School for management courses. He's bringing in people from the private
                    sector to work in the Bank and sending people from the Bank to the private
                    sector.</p>
                <p>For me, the best part of AID was serving in the field, and learning from these
                    people as well as trying to convey some new ideas and better methods from our
                    training and experience. AID has always been concerned with training people,
                    building institutions, and to develop an integrated country program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you seen any fundamental change in the world
                        situation, or in bilateral programs like AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I was looking at the DAC report for 1992, which reports on the
                    different bilateral programs and the relative contributions or burden-sharing
                    among donors. In terms of ODA flows, the US increasingly looks like a very poor
                    performer. We are now down to 0.15 percent of GNP in our ODA flows.</p>
                <p>Total private flows to developing countries was something like $41 billion in
                    1992. The United States accounted for something like $17 billion. Nobody was
                    close. The next figure was $5 billion for France. So we were like three times
                    higher. Therefore, just to look at the US share in ODA is a very incomplete
                    picture of the US “contribution” to development in the Third World. Almost all
                    of these private flows went to Latin America and East Asian countries and
                    contributed significantly to their growth. Incidentally, by 1995 private flows
                    including direct investment jumped to $150 billion worldwide and are now over
                    $200 billion.</p>
                <p>I just read the AID director Brian Atwood's latest statement to the Foreign
                    Policy Association. He makes the point that ODA (Official Development
                    Assistance) ought to be concentrated on the poor countries in Africa, as well as
                    to Bangladesh, Bolivia, and Nicaragua. A large number of countries in Asia and
                    Latin America don't need ODA and the US is providing private flows in very
                    significant amounts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there areas where bilateral type assistance is
                        required, because even private direct investment doesn't cover every
                        aspect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I think we should continue to support the National Academy of Science
                    and similar institutions that do research on global problems. AID for years put
                    money into producing a malaria vaccine. If they can get a vaccine for malaria
                    that works, it would be a fantastic breakthrough and I understand such a vaccine
                    has been developed.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>For years AID was putting money into developing a wheat variety which would have
                    a root system like clover, which could take nitrogen from the air. This would
                    save billions in fertilizer applications currently used on wheat fields. I think
                    AID should support further research in inexpensive methods for desalinization of
                    salt water, and more economic methods for producing solar energy — with
                    applications for the developing countries. Breakthroughs in these areas could
                    make an enormous impact in reducing poverty in the developing countries.</p>
                <p>In the use of ODA flows, we should be very selective and concentrate on the poor
                    countries where there is a participation and an open economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, you talk about poor countries, a lot of these
                        countries are a little better off, but there is massive poverty in these
                        countries, Brazil for example, and so on. Is there a role there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I think Brazil and India are alike. India is showing a hell of a lot of
                    growth now. They finally increased their exports. I remember when Korea had
                    twice or three times the level of exports that India had. I believe, despite
                    India's substantial growth, the absolute number of poor in India has probably
                    increased, and as a percentage of the total population, the poor are increasing.
                    These figures suggest that the Indian ruling parties are not concerned with
                    reducing poverty. I don't believe we have much leverage to get them to do more
                    to address their poverty problems. However, the people are much better informed
                    now in Africa and also in India, and are demanding more of their leaders in
                    terms of economic and social development. They want better results. What Kaunda
                    in Zambia, or Banda could get away with in Malawi, people will not tolerate it
                    anymore. In many African countries, there is a major political transformation
                    with the people participating in elections and calling for change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the rationale for foreign assistance...Two questions:
                        Was foreign aid effective in meeting the objectives of the State Department
                        in the political/security area. The rationale was it was used to further US
                        political objectives, and second, has that now simply evaporated and the
                        foreign aid is not required to address that kind of a question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Surely, we don't need foreign aid now to address the Cold War battles
                    of containing communism when foreign aid was used together with military aid to
                    strengthen our allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was foreign assistance effective in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I think that Korea was a success in terms of our objectives. Here was a
                    country invaded by the communists, the North Koreans and the Chinese, and became
                    a major recipient of our economic and military aid. They fought off the
                    communists and over the past decades developed a flourishing economy. Initially,
                    it was a repressive regime. They weren't open politically, but with economic
                    progress, their people are insisting on a more democratic society. Turkey was
                    also on the front line and threatened. We put a lot of aid into Turkey and the
                    country remained independent. In Turkey, economic development is still kind of
                    fragile, but it has made significant progress economically and in terms of a
                    more open society. In countries that were on the front line in the battle with
                    the communists, we provided substantial amounts of assistance, military and
                    economic, to Greece, Turkey, Korea and it worked —US foreign policy objectives
                    were realized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Africa? You spoke of Mobutu in Zaire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: The Cold War hurt African countries. They became pawns in the Cold War.
                    In little Somalia, we were competing with the Russians to gain control. The
                    Russians build a base, we build a base. Everybody dumped arms in there, and no
                    doubt contributed to Somalia's civil war. In Ethiopia, first the US supported
                    Haile Selassie, then the communists and Mengistu took over and the Russians and
                    East Bloc moved in. For the U.S. and Russia, it was a marginal involvement, but
                    for the Africans, it cost a lot in blood and treasure. Mobutu just hoodwinked
                    us. We convinced ourselves that somehow he was going to contain the Cubans in
                    Angola, and in some other places in Africa. So we tolerated his corruption, and
                    now the country is in shambles. In retrospect the “possible” danger of communist
                    takeover in Africa was not going to effect the world's future - it wasn't the
                    twilight battle for the Western World. We just want to make sure we had more
                    guys are our side than the Russians did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what's the rationale now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: What Brian Atwood is saying makes sense. In the poor countries, whether
                    it's a question of disease, famine, civil strife, it's a worthwhile investment
                    to help them address these problems, because if they multiply, the costs will be
                    greater in the long run. So that if the African countries are trying to reduce
                    poverty, disease, and hunger, we, as a major power in the world, and the leader
                    of the “free world,” have an interest and obligation to help them, especially
                    those countries with very low per capita incomes who need external resources.
                    The amounts of aid required, relative to our GDP, are not very large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is it in our interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: You can also make the case about the global economy and increasing
                    trade. As developing countries grow they become potential markets for the US But
                    I think the main reason is to prevent degradation: economic, environmental, and
                    of people. I believe we do have also a moral obligation. We've made human rights
                    an important part of our foreign policy. But we should only respond to countries
                    that are making a effort. We were talking about India and Brazil and the failure
                    of their leaders in addressing the poor in their country. In that situation, a
                    $20 million AID program or, even $220 million program will have little impact.
                    However, we've raised the social consciousness of the world with our being
                    concerned about poor people, and giving them economic and political
                    opportunities to develop. We put this on the development agenda, and I think
                    it's something Americans should be very proud of. Some people are always harping
                    that money has been wasted, but I believe, if you take a longer perspective, one
                    will see increasing improvements, even in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any concluding comment you would like to make
                        about your career in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I think the one point I'd make to young people who are listening is
                    about responding to life's chances or opportunities. My dad had a small textile
                    business, and I guess his idea was I was going to join him, and that's probably
                    the reason I took business administration at Rutgers. I didn't wind up in the
                    business with him, but in the US foreign aid program. So the point is you never
                    know where life is going to take you, and one should be open to unforeseen
                    opportunities. For me, working in development was a very good decision. I always
                    enjoyed the work and the people we worked with, my AID colleagues, and my
                    foreign counterparts. I still have very fond memories of people we met in the
                    Tunisian and Moroccan government, and then working in IFAD and the World Bank
                    was quite a rewarding experience. It was a career that I and my wife enjoyed. My
                    sons were a product of AID. One was born in Tunisia, and one in Algeria. We were
                    very fortunate, but I don't know if the AID program will continue to be as
                    exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there similar opportunities for young people
                        today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: Yes, because the IFIs will continue. The U.N. needs some good people,
                    and I believe there will continue to be a US bilateral program. I'm not one who
                    is hung up whether it is integrated into State, or a separate agency. I know a
                    lot of people felt that with the Vietnam War the AID program was compromised and
                    became too politicized. As I said at the outset of our discussion, I always
                    believed that foreign aid is part of our foreign policy. If the program is
                    integrated into the State Department, I don't think it would change very much.
                    Senior officials of AID are now part of the Senior Foreign Service. I ended my
                    career as a Career Minister.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that AID or the foreign assistance program in
                        the US was a pioneer in the whole development set of issues? Would you go so
                        far as to say that AID led the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIRNBAUM: I would say that so. The history of AID reflects that we were in the
                    forefront of many key development issues. Program assistance in AID goes back to
                    the '60's, when there were large program loans in India to get them to change
                    their trade and foreign exchange regime. AID was in the forefront of family
                    planning, before that was turned around in the Reagan Administration. People now
                    talk about capacity building as essential for growth and poverty reduction. One
                    of the great successes were AID's training programs. I don't know how many
                    hundreds of thousands of people were trained. There is the well known example of
                    the AID trained economists who went back to Indonesia and turned their economy
                    around. In terms of institutions, the agricultural university system in India
                    was made first rate with the help of US assistance. In Africa during 1960-70,
                    AID helped strengthen existing universities and helped establish new
                    universities in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia, as well as
                    scores of health clinics with the assistance of US land grant universities. The
                    Bank is just now talking about using a logical framework for developing
                    projects. How far back does that go in AID, 25 years ago?</p>
                <p>AID has been in the forefront of many of the changes in development programs. I
                    believe it's an American trait, when something doesn't work, or there's a
                    problem, we look for an answer, and we are prepared to take a risk and try
                    something new.</p>
