                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter, could you give me a little about your background,
                        where you came from, how you were educated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I went to Hamilton College where I got my B.A., majored in English and
                    French, which seems unlikely for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you use a lot of English...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: You use a lot of English, yes. And then after two years in the Army I
                    went to graduate school and did a Masters at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
                    International Studies (SAIS), and in the meantime had taken the Foreign Service
                    exams, and in 1957 came into the Foreign Service by way of a year with the
                    Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had interested you in the field of foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, I have to be very frank about this. I was just a young man
                    finishing college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you graduate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Summer of '53. My senior year I just had very little idea of what I
                    wanted to do. I thought about law school and decided not to do that. It was
                    sometime in the spring of my senior year when I saw a notice on the bulletin
                    board about the Foreign Service exams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was not something you'd been preparing for all
                        your life.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, not at all. The preparation really came later when I realized how
                    ill-prepared I was that I went to graduate school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at that point you began to think much more in terms of
                        graduate school as a beginning to focus on foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, the focus really came from the moment I decided to take the
                    Foreign Service exam. In those days it was the old exam, three and a half days,
                    and I was just totally unprepared for that.</p>
                <p>So after graduation I went to summer school right here at Georgetown, where they
                    ran a ten-week preparatory course for the written exam and tried to fill in
                    great chunks, the gaps in my own preparation: economics and history. At that
                    point I became much more interested in the process and began to learn a lot
                    about foreign affairs and diplomatic history as part of my preparation for the
                    areas where I had very little information, experience before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you enter the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Not until January of '57, because after that summer in Georgetown and
                    taking the written Foreign Service exam (you may remember it was a period when
                    there was no recruitment going on, a period of two or three years) I went in the
                    Army. I was drafted in the Army and spent two years in the Army.</p>
                <p>As I was coming out of the Army, I was really out of touch with Washington and
                    what was going on in the Foreign Service, and I assumed that there was still a
                    long waiting period. I had not taken the oral exam in any event. So I applied
                    for graduate school and was accepted. At the end of the first semester at SAIS,
                    I was called for the oral exam. That was the moment (it started really probably
                    a year before) they started recruiting very heavily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about 1955? I know I came in, in July of '55, and
                        we were the first class. In fact they called it Class Number One, the first
                        one they got together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, I was just getting out of the Army a couple of months after
                    that, and I started at graduate school. In early '56 I took the oral exam. And
                    when I passed it, they said, “Well, come right in.” They wanted me right away
                    because they were doing this expanded recruitment. I had just accepted a job. I
                    was bored with graduate school, frankly, and I had accepted a job on the Hill
                    and felt obligated to stay for a year. So then I didn't come in until early '57,
                    although I could have come in earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked just a minute about the Hill. What were you
                        doing on the Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: In those days Senators' staffs were really quite small. I worked on
                    the staff of a Senator from Maine, Paine of Maine. My title was Research
                    Assistant, but I did the functions that are now done by a Legislative Assistant.
                    I handled all his work in a number of areas. I did all the foreign policy
                    things. He was particularly interested in foreign trade and textiles. And then I
                    did work on his behalf on the Banking and Currency Committee, which had a
                    Housing Subcommittee that he was a member of. He was very interested in public
                    housing issues at that time. So I did kind of the whole range of legislative
                    activities for a Senator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working in the Senate just at the time when the
                        whole McCarthy thing was winding down. Did you get a feel about the attitude
                        within the Senate towards the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Not particularly towards the Foreign Service. McCarthy was still in
                    the Senate at that time, although he was a much diminished figure. One saw him
                    on the floor, and he was obviously an ill man and a broken man. But there were
                    still a number of very outspoken, Right Wing, Republican Senators: Welthur and
                    Capehart and Jennings, who were on the rabid Right. Their foreign policy views
                    were arch conservative, in fact radical conservative I would call them. So that
                    was still very much a part of the political scene at that time. I don't recall
                    getting a feel about Senators' views on the Foreign Service, but I certainly did
                    experience first-hand this very reactionary view against any kind of
                    internationalism and the Red scare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about within the senatorial staff workers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I did not sense that particularly. Now, my Senator was not on the
                    Foreign Relations Committee, so I was not working primarily or full-time on
                    foreign policy issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in then in '57?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Early '57, end of January.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: About 32, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could characterize it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, it very much reflected the effort to broaden the recruiting
                    base, at least geographically, not that we had a lot of minorities. There were
                    four women in the class, but there were no Blacks or Hispanics. That part of the
                    broadening was to come later. But the geographic broadening was in full
                    swing.</p>
                <p>The class came from all over the country. A few people who were just fresh out of
                    college, several others who had been around awhile doing various things, either
                    working or graduate school. Most had, most of the men, anyway, had military
                    experience.</p>
                <p>There were three or four in the class who had already spent some time working in
                    the department, had come into IR as civil servants, spent a year or two and then
                    gotten themselves somehow transferred into the Foreign Service and were in this
                    class also.</p>
                <p>I would say that it was probably an average group, and by and large it did not
                    particularly distinguish itself. By the time we hit the middle ranks, probably
                    half the class was gone for one reason or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This might be a little difficult, it's hard to recreate
                        the past, but was there a spirit at the time of the United States having a
                        mission, or was this the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I would say that was very much mixed. I think some people came to this
                    with the sense of mission, and others came to it as a job. The latter ones were
                    probably the ones who peeled off first, fastest. When they got their Foreign
                    Service experience stamping visas in Tijuana they decided this wasn't even a
                    good job, and off they went into something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first two posts, because we're going to concentrate
                        more on your senior times, but first was Vigo, Spain, from 1959 to '61, and
                        then you were in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, from '61 to '64 as a Political
                        Officer. What was your impression of your first post in Vigo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, it was a very isolated thing — you might as well have been in
                    the Third World somewhere. Spain had still not come out of the Civil War and
                    World War II experience. They were desperately poor, and economic recovery had
                    not really begun. It was just in its initial steps and was not even evident out
                    in the provinces.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>We had a two-man post there, which was closed three or four years later (probably
                    should have been closed earlier). There wasn't an awful lot to do, frankly. The
                    advantage of the post, from a personal point of view, was its isolation and that
                    there were very few English-speaking people about. Spaniards didn't speak
                    English, so I really learned Spanish there. I might have done that somewhere
                    else where I could have been more... I got some reporting experience and that
                    kind of thing. I don't suppose the reports were ever read by anybody, but at
                    least I learned how to write them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in Tegucigalpa as a Political Officer, was this a
                        different experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Oh, indeed it was. It was a particularly interesting time in Honduras.
                    It was the Alliance for Progress period, rather intense US interest in Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>An elected government was coming to the close of its term. It was the first
                    elected government that Honduras had had in donkey years or maybe ever, I can't
                    quite remember now. And we were very hopeful that there could be a peaceful
                    transition to a second elected government and begin to establish some roots for
                    democratic institutions in Honduras.</p>
                <p>In the event, that did not happen, and there was a military coup in late '63. One
                    of a series of coups in Latin America that put the finish to the political side
                    of the Alliance for Progress and our hope that we could somehow foster
                    democratic institutions in Latin America over the short term. That's something
                    we've only come back to in recent years. For about 20 years, that was just
                    a...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you react, or the embassy react, during the coup
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We did all the things that we could think to do to try to encourage
                    this transition via another democratic election. We made it very clear to
                    everyone that that's what we wanted to see happen in Honduras.</p>
                <p>It became evident in the months prior to the elections that there was a coup
                    fever abroad. One of the political parties, the conservative party, was
                    encouraging the military to undertake a coup. The ruling party itself was
                    somewhat split over the question of succession. And the man who won the party
                    nomination was not universally liked, even in his own party. So there was a
                    tremendous amount of factionalism, which provided a base for a coup, because the
                    political fabric was so sundered there.</p>
                <p>We did what we could through our representations to the parties, to the military,
                    to the friends of the military who would drop in to the embassy and say, “Gee,
                    doesn't the United States want to see a coup here?”.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Part of the background to all this was what was going on in Cuba and Fidel
                    Castro's efforts to export his own revolution through Central America and Latin
                    America, generally. And that provided for the US government a certain degree of
                    pause.</p>
                <p>It is possible that we were not as forceful as we should have been in batting
                    down any suggestions of coups, although all the representations that the
                    Ambassador made that I was involved in it were really quite, quite strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador, Chuck Burrows?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, he's now dead.</p>
                <p>Through the department we got the OAS to send an election observer team down to
                    Honduras to verify that the election procedures were all in order, that the
                    registration process was a clean one, that the balloting procedures set up by
                    the government were adequate.</p>
                <p>What we had hoped was that team would stay in Honduras through the elections and,
                    as an international presence, certify that the elections had been honest and try
                    to pull away a potential rationale for the military to make a coup.</p>
                <p>That may, in fact, have speeded up the timetable for a coup, because the military
                    moved just before the elections were held so that there could be no question of
                    their overthrowing someone who was popularly elected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize that you were a relatively junior officer at the
                        time, but did you have a feeling then that either the CIA or the military
                        was not really fully on board with this policy, because, again, we were
                        looking at Cuba. Cuba was a major preoccupation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I have no reason to believe that any element in the US government was
                    actively supporting a coup.</p>
                <p>There were, as you note, varying degrees of enthusiasm for the democratic
                    process. In certain parts of the government the primary concern was resistance
                    or opposition to Cuba and to Fidel. And that, obviously, colored certain
                    views.</p>
                <p>After the coup, some of these views came out in a clearer way. The
                    Administration's reaction to the coup was to recall the Ambassador, suspend
                    economic and military assistance. There were a number of voices on the country
                    team who were outspokenly opposed to that and thought we should simply get on
                    with the job of dealing with the man who was a committed anti-Communist.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, I liked it a lot. I liked it a lot. I was really enjoying myself,
                    particularly this second post, Honduras, and it was an ideal job for a junior
                    officer. It was a small embassy, a small political section. I had a boss whose
                    Spanish (he was a Wristonee) was not very good, so I really got the Wristonee
                    section in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add, for those reading, the Wriston Program was
                        one which brought basically civil servants who had been stationed in
                        Washington in the State Department into the Foreign Service. Often these did
                        not have the same training or experience at the level they came in that
                        would be expected of a Foreign Service officer. They were called Wristonees.
                        You came back to the State Department in '64, and you spent about a year in

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: In the Near East-South Asia Bureau. I wanted to make a switch at that
                    point from Latin American Affairs. Not that I had anything particular against
                    service in Latin America, but the word around at that time was once you got into
                    that you never got out. I wanted to experience something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to ask you how you felt, because we are pretty
                        much contemporaries, and the word was that Latin America was somehow second
                        rate, as opposed to exciting things in Eastern Europe or Africa at the time,
                        or the Near East, or the Far East, and Western Europe was more for the
                        sophisticates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Right. Never made that float.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Oh, very definitely. There was definitely a feeling in the department
                    that ARA was a second rate bureau and had second rate, retired people. The
                    bureau itself was trying to do something about that. A lot of very able, younger
                    people came into the bureau about that time, and, obviously, their intention was
                    to hang onto them. I just didn't want to get set in that mold for the rest of my
                    career. It seemed to me there was a big world out there, and I was very young
                    and new, and I wanted to see more of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what sort of work were you doing as a Staff
                        Assistant and who were you working for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I had been recruited for the job by Phillips Talbot, who was a
                    political appointee. Just about the time I came on board, he was on his way out
                    as Ambassador to Greece. Raymond Hare replaced him as Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>Now, Hare didn't know me and hadn't recruited me, and I had no experience at all
                    in Near East-South Asia. I think he had his doubts about whether I could do
                    this.</p>
                <p>Well, you know what a Staff Assistant's work is. You handle all of the paper that
                    flows in and out of the bureau that needs the attention of the Assistant
                    Secretary or the Deputy Assistant Secretaries.</p>
                <p>So you play a very important role in rationing his time, and you are one of the
                    important interfaces between the bureau and the Seventh Floor, the Secretary's
                    office and the Under Secretary's. If you're doing the job right, you make sure
                    that that interface is operating effectively and that the bureau is serving the
                    needs of the Secretary and his principal deputies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of effectiveness, looking back now, how did you
                        evaluate Raymond Hare as an operator within the Washington system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, I thought he was very good. This was really at the end of his
                    career. He had been Ambassador in a number of places, had been Director General
                    of the Foreign Service. I thought he was superb.</p>
                <p>He felt very keenly that the Seventh Floor and Secretary Rusk's time was taken up
                    almost exclusively by the Vietnam War. And so he was very, very careful and
                    solicitous of the Secretary's time, and did what he could to keep problems from
                    impinging on the Secretary's preoccupations with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Hare was a man of such stature in the service and in Washington that he wasn't a
                    man who had to barge around with elbows flying, because people respected him and
                    knew him. He had a long and very distinguished career.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any of the pressures or observe any of,
                        probably the most effective of the various ethnic lobbies, the Israeli
                        lobby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Oh, sure. Yes, I was very conscious of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did one deal with this and yet maintain a broad-based
                        foreign policy in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The bureau may have, over the long term, suffered for this, but the
                    bureau's view was that dealing with the lobby that represented Israel's
                    supporters was essentially a political job for another level. This was a job for
                    the Secretary, for the President, for the Congress, and the bureau's job was to
                    serve up to the Secretary and the President recommendations that did not really
                    take that into account.</p>
                <p>Now, inevitably, some knowledge of the force and strength and positions of an
                    important lobby have to affect to some degree the way you frame issues. But NEA
                    resisted that very hard, and hence became known to the lobby and to the lobby's
                    supporters as pro-Arab, which I think was always a canard against NEA. But it
                    reflected an effort to step back one and not be influenced by the lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel that? Here you were, in some ways, in a
                        good position. You came up really from more the Latin-type atmosphere, so
                        you weren't committed within the bureau to be either an Arabist or an
                        Israeliist or something. Did you feel that there were competing forces
                        fighting within the bureau, or were the Arabists vehement against Israel?
                        How did you see this view at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I don't think so. I don't think it broke down quite that way, that
                    there was a pro-Israeli group or a pro-Arab group. There was a strong tradition
                    in the bureau that we had important interests with Arab countries, which were
                    not very well known in the United States and had no particular resonance in any
                    of our domestic concerns, and that there was a job to be done to maintain
                    relationships with them, and that our relationships with Israel had their own
                    particular momentum and rationale, and that those were important to protect,
                    too. But the bureau's job was to find ways to do that, that would not impinge
                    upon our ability to maintain relationships with an important set of countries in
                    the Arab world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you? You obviously applied and took Hindi,
                        Urdu training from 1967 to '68. Why there? What were you getting about the
                        subcontinent? Because NEA seemed so concentrated on the Arab-Israeli problem
                        that one always suspects that the subcontinent doesn't quite get the
                        attention maybe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: It often seems like that, because there is so much focus on the
                    Arab-Israeli dispute, but there are a lot of people in the bureau who are
                    dedicated full-time to the South Asian problems.</p>
                <p>I'd only been in the bureau about two days when war broke out between India and
                    Pakistan, the '65 War. And so, inevitably, I got involved in (just in reading as
                    papers crossed my desk) a lot about the subcontinent and got interested in it. I
                    had done reading on my own about India and Pakistan, which I found interesting
                    before.</p>
                <p>One of the things I had had in mind when I came over to NEA as Staff Assistant
                    was that I might go on to some posting in South Asia. As I looked around, I
                    realized there were a lot of people interested in it at that time, probably more
                    so then than is the case now, and that the sure route to getting an assignment
                    as a Political Officer in South Asia was to take the language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the '65 War, did you have any feel at that
                        time within the bureau... How did the people within the bureau feel about
                        the war? Were they siding with India or Pakistan or saying, “Oh, my God, a
                        plague on both your houses?” What did you feel that the attitude was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Some of this may be retrospective reflection, really, rather than
                    feelings I had at the time, because I was so green and probably wasn't sensitive
                    to all the nuances at the time.</p>
                <p>Certainly overall in US policy there has been a bias towards Pakistan, with some
                    fluctuations in that occasionally towards India. Now a number of people who
                    worked on these problems personally felt that the kind of policy that had been
                    first constructed by John Foster Dulles of including Pakistan in CENTO and a
                    bilateral commitment to Pakistan's security was a mistake, that India was the
                    big cheese in South Asia and we should have cast our lot with India. So there
                    were many people who felt that at the bureaucratic level, at the lower levels in
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>But at the policy level, by and large, it remained rather consistent with what
                    Henry Kissinger came to call a tilt towards Pakistan, partially for strategic
                    reasons and, secondarily, because India never wanted to have the kind of
                    relationship that we would have sought as a substitute for the relationship we
                    had with Pakistan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That's right. But it was deeper than that. It involved our view of the
                    Soviet Union, our view of China, India's view of those countries, views of the
                    Third World. There were a whole series of issues in which we and India simply
                    did not view things through the same prism.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: We had a consulate general there, and I was the Political Officer on
                    the consulate staff and also the Deputy Principal Officer. The fun part of what
                    I did was the political side. Lahore is located in the Punjab, and the Punjab is
                    really the major province in Pakistan.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: No, it's really quite south of that. It's right next to the Indian
                    border, about 20 miles from the Indian border in the heart of the Punjab. The
                    Punjab is the most populous province in what is now Pakistan, so it was a key
                    political center. Islamabad was a brand new, artificial capitol, so the embassy
                    was really rather isolated. They didn't have many people up there to talk
                    to.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: They'd just moved up from Karachi, so they were way off in an isolated

                    consulates was especially important because it was very hard for Islamabad to
                    stay in touch.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Pakistan in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Field Marshal Ayub had been President for ten years in a rather
                    authoritarian government, which he characterized as democratic. But the election
                    process was a contentious one in the indirect election process, in which there
                    were real constraints on the opposition. His leading opponent at the time that I
                    arrived in Pakistan was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in West Pakistan and then Mujib in
                    East Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Everybody thought that Ayub's government was quite stable, but there were some
                    things going on underneath the surface that erupted shortly after I reached
                    Lahore. Some of these were fallouts from the '65 War, which was something of a
                    psychological disaster, a political disaster for Pakistan and for the leadership
                    in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>It was after that war that Bhutto broke with Ayub. Bhutto himself may have been
                    as responsible as anybody for the major error that Pakistan made in starting
                    that war, goading Ayub into doing it. But he managed to walk away from it,
                    dropping all of the blame on Ayub, and he himself came out rather clean in a bit
                    of an heroic posture, which he then used to exploit against Ayub.</p>
                <p>The process of street demonstrations started in Pakistan. The most important ones
                    were in Lahore and in Dacca in East Pakistan. Eventually, after three or four
                    months of this, they brought Ayub down in a military coup and led to another
                    whole new process, which ended with the separation of East Pakistan and the war
                    with India in '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see the situation, as you saw our operations
                        there, the political thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We had a political Ambassador at the time, a very fine man.</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, at first in '68 it was Benjamin Oehlert. He felt very strongly
                    that his mission there was to support Ayub. Now I think others would have
                    defined our relationship with Pakistan as the thing that we wanted to preserve
                    and promote in some way. But he interpreted this as a commitment to an
                    individual, to the then-President Ayub. So he was increasingly distressed as
                    Ayub was weakened and eventually brought down. I think others of us tended to
                    see that not so much as tragedy, the end of Ayub.But other problems that came in
                    the wake of that were serious problems: the divisions between East and West
                    Pakistan, which eventually led to the secession and the war with India, but that
                    our policy should not have been hinged on one man. Not that there were serious
                    consequences of that, because, as in so many situations where a leader is
                    brought down by the will of his own people, the revolt of his own people, there
                    was very little we could do about it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: '68 was the end of the Johnson Administration. Oehlert had been sent
                    there by Johnson. He used to say that Johnson had told him when he went out
                    there to take care of Ayub.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Ayub had given him quite a welcome as Vice

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, Americans were...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Camel driver [?]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, exactly. Americans were very fond of Ayub. Ayub was quite a
                    distinguished-looking person, spoke forcefully, stood ramrod straight, and spoke
                    a language that was music to the ears of American political leaders. He was
                    anti-Soviet and a good military type.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm a little confused. Ayub came down when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Early '69.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the war come about that separated
                        Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Not until '71. But it all flowed from this event as the political life
                    opened up with the collapse of Ayub, even though there was a martial law
                    administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The martial law administration was regarded as a rather weak one. General Yahya
                    promised political reforms and democratic elections, which indeed were held in
                    '70. And they were free and fair, as nearly as anybody could tell.</p>
                <p>But the results were a political disaster, because Mujib, the Awami League, won a
                    massive victory in East Pakistan. I think they won all the seats but one.</p>
                <p>And Bhutto emerged as the largest vote-getter in West Pakistan, although he
                    probably would not have had a majority. I can't recall the figures now, but
                    anyway he was clearly the leading political figure in West Pakistan.</p>
                <p>A struggle for dominance of the center in Islamabad by the Awami League began.
                    The West Pakistanis had always dominated the central government. The East
                    Pakistanis had regarded this as disadvantageous to them. By winning a majority,
                    Mujib had had a majority for the center. But there was great consternation in
                    West Pakistan, because, for the first time in the brief history of that country,
                    the West Pakistanis were going to have to subsidize the East. In the past, it
                    had worked the other way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are in Lahore, you're in West Pakistan. In the
                        first place, how did you view Bhutto, you, personally, but also the
                        consulate general? You were reporting on this man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I think, with some suspicion. I will say that we did not realize how
                    popular Bhutto had become out in the boondocks, how forcefully his message had
                    been received by peasants who were going to vote for the first time. To some
                    extent we accepted the view that old feudal patterns would still prevail when
                    the votes were finally counted, that even though elections were ostensibly fair,
                    the influence of landlords over their tenants would still be very strong in the
                    polling place.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, that wasn't true at all. They completely ignored the views of
                    the landlords and voted for Bhutto as a political revolutionary who was going to
                    change land tenure systems, abolish feudalism, abolish the great industrialists
                    who controlled so much of the wealth of the country. He campaigned with a
                    revolutionary message, and it took. He won a stunning victory in the Punjab.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had looked upon Pakistan as being a rather firm ally to
                        us and our anti-Soviet stance. Was there the feeling that here was somebody
                        who would not be as strong? Were we doing anything maybe not to change the
                        thing at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No. There was a lot of concern about Bhutto being too opportunistic,
                    too antagonistic to India, perhaps a little bit too slippery. But I don't think
                    there was fundamental concern that he would lead Pakistan away from a
                    relationship with the United States that we valued. The concern about him was
                    not so much in foreign policy terms but in the quality of the man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling of almost localitis — there you were
                        sitting in a major post in West Pakistan, and things were happening in
                        Dacca, in Bangladesh, which was Bengali, which was almost a thousand miles
                        on the other side of..., separated — that there were completely different
                        dynamics over there? Was there much interaction between our two posts or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: There was a lot, and I credit the embassy for being very open this
                    way. Even though initially when I was first there and there was agitation
                    against Ayub, Ambassador Oehlert was less than pleased about the kind of
                    reporting that was coming from the consulates, because we were predicting that
                    Ayub would go under.</p>
                <p>Oehlert didn't see it that way and really didn't like that going to Washington.
                    But he didn't do anything to stop it, to his credit. He came down and talked to
                    us and tried to argue his case with us, but he didn't interfere with the
                    reporting. Subsequently, when we changed Ambassadors and the martial law
                    regime...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The new Ambassador was Joseph S. Farland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: There was a tremendous amount of interaction between the consulates
                    and the embassy. There was a regular process of having Political Officers and
                    principal officers from the constituent posts go up to Islamabad, meet with the
                    country team and thrash through the issues. All the reporting from the
                    consulates was shared with each other, so that we had full access to what they
                    were saying from Dacca, what that point of view was. I thought that part of the
                    operation was very good, it was really excellent.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until '71, when Yahya ordered a military crackdown in East Pakistan,
                    that the harmony within the country team began to fly apart, because the
                    perspective from Dacca became dramatically different from the view of the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. The crackdown started in March of '71. I left the post in May of
                    '71 and then came back to Washington on the Pakistan desk, so I was still
                    working on it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: At the time of the crackdown it was Arch Blood. And he stayed sometime
                    into the summer, I think.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I think they felt that in the embassy. And I think they felt that back
                    in Washington, that he had taken, that the consulate and the reporting had taken
                    too pro-Bengali a view, which I don't quite agree with. They felt very strongly
                    that what the Pakistanis were doing, one, would be unsuccessful, would ruin the
                    country and therefore was not in the US interest and, two, that it was barbaric,
                    and they were really shocked by what was happening there.</p>

                        together, or saying, you know, this is going to go, this is never going to
                        hold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Views were really quite different, and they operated on a number of
                    levels. I'm not sure the different levels entirely understood the views of the
                    other levels and why they were held the way they were.</p>
                <p>But the time was 1971, and we were in a period of domestic uproar over Vietnam
                    and Cambodia, a feeling that the United States was somehow over-committed around
                    the world, and that we were sticking our nose into things and we shouldn't be,
                    and that we should be in a period of retraction, get out of Vietnam and bury our
                    heads in the sand. Some of this affected our people around the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Prior to the actual crackdown, when there was a period of negotiation going on
                    between politicians in East and West Pakistan, the embassy's view generally was
                    that we should stay out of this, let them settle their own hash, and that no
                    vital American interests were involved in this. We argued from Lahore that it
                    wouldn't cost much for us to involve ourselves in a low-level way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doing what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Talking to leaders on both sides to see if there was any kind of a
                    mediation that might help them to get to a political settlement and reach
                    agreement on a continuation of a united Pakistan, but with some modifications
                    for greater autonomy for the provinces, some formula like that. Formulas which
                    were being discussed and which came close to success, but didn't quite make
                    it.</p>
                <p>But the embassy and indeed the department didn't accept that view. And even in
                    East Pakistan, our people felt that we should just keep our nose out of
                    this.</p>
                <p>I think, in retrospect, we should have had our nose in it, because once the
                    separation became a serious problem and there was a military crackdown, there
                    was a furor in the Congress.</p>
                <p>Henry Kissinger's view of this was not so much that a united Pakistan was
                    important to us, but that we had very important incipient relations with China
                    that were involved in what happened to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Pakistan was China's oldest and closet friend. They were one of the first to
                    recognize the Communist regime and had developed a very close relationship with
                    China. That was important to China.</p>
                <p>Henry Kissinger saw what was important to China as being important to us if we
                    were going to develop any kind of relationship with China. We had to persuade
                    the Chinese that we understood their interests and could support some of their
                    interests elsewhere in the world, and that there would be a value in having a
                    relationship with us.</p>
                <p>But this was not understood in the department, because it was not articulated at
                    all. Henry was running his own Pakistan policy over in the White House.</p>

                    feeling this constant heat from the Hill and from the press: Why are we
                    supporting Pakistan? Why haven't we cut off all arms shipments to them? Why
                    haven't we cut off all assistance to them? Here they are butchering Bengalis in
                    Dacca, and you're carrying on. India, in any event, is the important country in
                    South Asia. They're opposed to what's happening in Pakistan and yet we're
                    kicking them in the groin. Why are we doing these things?</p>
                <p>Henry was not in a position at that point, because up until August he hadn't even
                    visited China, they were just trying to get something...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So behind the scenes there was this using Pakistan in
                        order to get us into China, and actually it did work that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: It did work that way, yes. None of us could understand what the hell
                    was going on really. Why was Henry so determined to tilt towards Pakistan?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a very famous phrase, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, a phrase he used in an NSC meeting that was then leaked to the
                    press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That we were going to tilt towards Pakistan and yet we
                        had, you might say, bigger fish to fry. But it still poisons the well as far
                        as India's concerned today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: To some extent I suppose it does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least it's always there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: On that level you had a strategic concern about the breakup of
                    Pakistan. Not so much for what the breakup per se was going to do to Pakistan or
                    to our interests, it was the way it happened, and how it happened, and how could
                    this be managed so that what Nixon and Kissinger were trying to do with China
                    would not be damaged.</p>
                <p>And I must say they handled it brilliantly. They tilted a bit towards Pakistan.
                    We weren't shipping them any arms of any consequence, and before the war broke
                    out we really had closed the pipeline down entirely.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We made an attempt to see if there was any way to mediate between Yahya and
                    Mujib, who was in jail in Calcutta. That collapsed in the course of the months
                    that we were trying to do it, to see if there could be a peaceful
                    resolution.</p>
                <p>When that was impossible, we tried to get the Indians to hold back and not invade
                    East Pakistan. That was not successful. As anyone could have foreseen, the
                    Indians cleaned up East Pakistan fairly quickly and liberated Bangladesh. The
                    issue then was would they invade West Pakistan.</p>
                <p>I don't know to this day what the Indian intentions were. There was an
                    intelligence report floating around that there had been a Cabinet discussion of
                    launching an attack on Pakistan and ending the threat from the Pakistanis once
                    and for all.</p>
                <p>Henry Kissinger seized on this and later claimed that he was convinced that that
                    was the intention of the Indian government. I think it wasn't so clear. But he
                    then went into a kind of diplomatic tour de force of warning the Indians off
                    from this, sending the Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Enterprise being our nuclear carrier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: And also (although I'm not sure of this) warning the Soviets against
                    any further Indian attacks against Pakistan. The upshot was a cease fire and the
                    end of the war.</p>
                <p>Now, all of this, I'm convinced, was done for the purpose of assuring the Chinese
                    that we took their interests in South Asia seriously.</p>
                <p>After the war, Shulzberger went to China. (He was a pundit for The New York
                    Times.) He went to China, and he also visited in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the Yahya government, defeated by India, collapsed and Bhutto
                    came into power in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>But Shulzberger did a column in The New York Times, which I thought was quite
                    fascinating. Bhutto told Shulzberger that the United States saved Pakistan by
                    warning the Indians off from an attack against the West. And how did he know
                    this? The Chinese told him. The article doesn't say how the Chinese knew, but
                    one suspects that Henry told them.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>So it was a very brilliantly constructed policy. But it was a hidden-hand kind of
                    policy, and it was very difficult for the people who were working in the
                    vineyards to understand what was going on and why, and why the moves were
                    constructed the way they were. And not just difficult for us, it was difficult
                    for the Congress and for the press because none of this was articulated, or
                    could be articulated. It would have been blown out of the water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were back in Washington on the desk by this time. You
                        were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Just in the dark. We went on doing our business. We ran from our
                    office the effort to do a mediation between Yahya and Mujib. We wrote the
                    telegrams on that, the instructions and so on. But we didn't understand how they
                    fit into a larger view. And we really didn't understand very well why there was
                    such a pronounced tilt towards Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fascinating. Well, you came back in spring of '71,
                        and you were then, I suppose, probably immediately co-opted onto the desk,
                        weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Right, I'd come back to go on the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The desk was India-Pakistan desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: There were two different offices: an India-Nepal-Sri Lanka office and
                    a Pakistan-Afghanistan office. Subsequently, that became
                    Pakistan-Afghanistan-Bangladesh office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From that vantage point, you were there from '71 to '72,
                        how did you see the threat of the Soviet Union in that area, including
                        Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: In that period we saw it as not terribly great. The one element in the
                    Soviet threat that was important to us was the Soviet relationship with India.
                    That was formalized in the summer of '71 in a friendship treaty. Not that
                    anybody thought that India was going to go Communist or become a handmaiden for
                    the Soviets, but we didn't like the relationship with the Soviets. And we didn't
                    like it when they formalized that in a treaty relationship. And, in general, we
                    didn't like lots of elements of Indian foreign policy that seemed to us to be
                    too close to the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, at the time India was not... Part of this

                        International...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We didn't like the role they played there I don't believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We always felt that at least there were the Poles, the
                        Indians, and the Canadians, and we felt at least we knew where the Poles
                        were. But the Indians pretended to be neutral and yet they were very
                        pro-Soviet. Did you feel any conflict, internally in the Near East, in
                        dealing with South Asia on the thing? I mean did you have Indianists and
                        Pakistaniists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: To some extent we did, yes. Although in '71, people were so appalled
                    by what the Pakistanis were doing in East Pakistan that we all became a little
                    bit anti-Pakistan in that period and a little more pro-India. India got the ten
                    million refugees, and we were sympathetic to that dilemma. But our biggest
                    problem was this different views at different levels, and our inability to
                    comprehend what the rationale was that was driving the Kissinger part of the
                    government, which was in control of policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at a juncture where one could feel the tremors,
                        the difference between Rogers and Kissinger, too, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: This became a junior feud in terms of military supply policy. After
                    the '65 War when we embargoed arms sales to both India and Pakistan (it was more
                    important in the Pakistan case, because we had been a principal supplier to
                    Pakistan up to that point), we had restored some military sales to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>It was a very modest program, and we weren't all that important to them. Certain
                    kinds of spare parts were key, because we had supplied airplanes to them and so
                    on. They had long since turned to China and to international markets as their
                    major suppliers.</p>
                <p>But when the trouble started and the crackdown occurred in East Pakistan, there
                    was a huge hue and cry from the Congress and from the press: Why are we
                    supplying any arms to these butchers? And it was a good question.</p>
                <p>Rogers wanted to shut down any arms sales to Pakistan. And Kissinger was opposed.
                    This went on for months and months. Rogers ostensibly prevailed and turned off
                    any new sales.</p>
                <p>Then there was the issue of the pipeline. He [ROGERS OR KISSINGER?] would say
                    nothing was leaving, then The New York Times would discover some ship had sailed
                    out of Baltimore Harbor loaded with arms for Pakistan. This was a lesson to me
                    on how hard it is to control something within our government.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, the policy still allowed for certain limited sales. Rogers kept
                    driving at this, and driving at this, and driving at this, trying to get this
                    shut down. And Henry kept resisting, and resisting, and resisting. We were
                    caught in the middle and not comprehending why the resistance was so great from
                    the White House.</p>
                <p>So I think the most important service that I did to Rogers and to Joe Sisco, who
                    was then Assistant Secretary, was to figure out some tricky little way that we
                    could close down the remaining things that we were shipping to Pakistan without
                    getting the Pakistanis too mad at us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Oh, I can't remember. It was a letter that I think Rogers sent to
                    Yahya explaining why we had to do this and trying to put the best light on it.
                    It was a drafting exercise, essentially, but the Pakistanis took it in good
                    grace. What we were cutting off at that point was very marginal. So we were able
                    to finally say, and it satisfied Rogers, that we were not shipping any more
                    military equipment to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'll have to remind me on the dates. When did Nixon make
                        the announcement that he'd gone over to China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That Kissinger had gone. You see, Kissinger went in August of '71. He
                    flew secretly from Pakistan to Beijing. Nobody knew he'd done it until he got
                    back and announced it a few days later, and at that time announced that Nixon
                    would be going in January. Now if we hadn't been so dense, it was at that point
                    that we should have understood a little bit better exactly what...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask, the light bulb did not really go
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The light bulb went on in a sense, but I don't think any of us really
                    quite got our arms around the whole rationale that Kissinger felt, and Nixon
                    felt, it was important to somehow satisfy Pakistan's Chinese interest in
                    Pakistan through this period. I don't think we saw all of that — the little
                    maneuvers that were never explained, the tilt towards Pakistan. Some elements of
                    it still were hard to rationalize during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, isn't there a certain amount of style, at least from
                        what I've heard, that Henry Kissinger enjoyed doing this thing? I mean it
                        was a constant thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, I suppose. Although I think he really did feel that he had to
                    play a hidden hand here, while temperamentally that was his inclination anyway.
                    But I think in this instance he was right, that to have stated the rationale,
                    revealed the rationale, he'd have been blown right out of the water. And Nixon
                    maybe would never have gotten to China. It would have been seen in the Congress
                    and in the press as a very high price to pay for a toast in the Great Hall of
                    the People. It was a very difficult policy to get through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, to move on. We're obviously going to come back
                        to this area. You went to the War College from 1972 to '73. In this time,
                        without going into all the particulars, did you notice a difference in
                        attitude between the military men above the Colonel level, who were on their
                        way up? Did they understand the State Department and how we operated,
                        diplomatic things? I'm saying this in context of the misunderstanding we've
                        had in recent weeks about the diplomatic role in our little invasion into
                        Panama, which was militarily fairly well done, diplomatically an absolute
                        disaster. I'm just thinking about your view of the military mind and the
                        State Department mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: There were very pronounced and sharp differences. The military
                    population in the War College, by and large, were people who had no experience
                    of any kind in the international arena. They might have served in Germany as
                    part of forces committed under NATO, but unless they had done staff work in some
                    international organization or the JCS, I think they had a very limited world
                    view.</p>
                <p>They tended to be rather hawkish, quite defensive about Vietnam at that time,
                    disturbed by the way Vietnam was ending, understandably. State Department people
                    were quite dovish in that period. Therefore, their views and the views of the
                    military at the War College were quite divergent on a lot of foreign policy
                    issues.</p>
                <p>The dialogue was not always (sometimes it was) a terribly sophisticated one,
                    because the background that the military people brought to the discussion was
                    too limited.</p>
                <p>This was a real difference that I noticed later in my career, particularly when I
                    started doing the peacekeeping thing in the Middle East, that American officers
                    who reached the Colonel level very often are there with no experience at all in
                    any kind of international environment or affairs. Whereas those in the British
                    Army, Norwegians, Europeans, generally, had had quite a different experience and
                    arrive at the Colonel level with a much greater degree of sophistication about
                    foreign affairs than Americans do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is true. Also, most Foreign Service officers,
                        certainly of our generation, have had a good, solid injection of military,
                        albeit maybe at the enlisted ranks, but they have served in the military and
                        have some idea of the military. Whereas the American military just does not
                        have, generally, any feel, and it causes real problems in having dialogues I
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That is true, that is true. I don't know quite how this played out in
                    the example you just cited of Panama and the diplomatic snafus in Panama, but
                    the one thing that always struck me about the military is they accept, in
                    principle and fervently, the notion of civilian command, that their orders come
                    from a civilian chain: the President, Secretary of Defense, and so on.</p>
                <p>For Foreign Service officers, Ambassadors dealing with military on the country
                    team, or Deputy Assistant Secretaries or Assistant Secretaries dealing with
                    people in the Pentagon, it's a tremendous advantage that they understand
                    civilian authority and accept it. Civilians don't always know how to use that
                    and how to convey that to the military.</p>
                <p>I had a friend who always said that if you want to really convey something to the
                    military, put it in writing, because they not only respect civilian authority,
                    but they respect the written word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have a tendency to give our instructions almost by
                        indirection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, indeed, we're always clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the diplomatic style. Well now, you came right
                        back. You certainly had your concentration in the area we're talking about,
                        the subcontinent. After the War College, I have you from '73 to '76 as the
                        office Director for Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. What was the
                        situation there at that time, the '73 to '76 period? The Nixon
                        Administration, Vietnam, fell in that period, and the United States was
                        reeling a bit from world commitments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, indeed, indeed. Things were settling down in South Asia after the
                    '71 War. West Pakistan seemed to be pulling itself together under Bhutto's
                    leadership, and with a good deal of support from us. In Bangladesh, the worst
                    disasters were being avoided, again with massive assistance from the US,
                    primarily in food.</p>
                <p>An interesting political change in East Pakistan, in Bangladesh, was occurring,
                    which in some ways made things easier. After the flush of liberation, the more
                    natural concerns began to play themselves out, and the Bengalis began to resist
                    Indian influence. One way for them to do this was to reconcile themselves with
                    Pakistan and, through Pakistan, the rest of the Islamic world. And that was very
                    good for Pakistani morale.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>In, I think it was '74, Mujib flew from Dacca to Lahore to an Islamic conference
                    meeting with Bhutto. It was a reconciliation, which one could not have expected
                    in such a short time. It was an amazing turnaround. But it was good both for the
                    Bengalis and for the Pakistanis. The Indians were licking their wounds after we
                    had kicked them around in '71, but things were gradually getting better, and
                    some of those wounds were healing.</p>
                <p>It was not a period of great activism for US policy in South Asia. Things began
                    to unravel a little bit in Afghanistan in ways that we did not fully understand.
                    The monarchy was abolished, and a member of the King's family declared a
                    republic, and so President Daoub (inaudible). And this was to come back and
                    haunt us later when the King himself was thrown out in the Communist coup. What
                    we understood, but didn't necessarily fully appreciate what the ramifications
                    would be, was that with the abolition of the monarchy went probably the only
                    Afghan institution that was capable of reaching or covering such disparate
                    ethnic and tribal elements in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>Kissinger, by then Secretary of State, continued to have a very warm place in his
                    heart for Pakistan. And we had to deal with, again, one of the aftermath issues
                    from the '71 War.</p>
                <p>Secretary Rogers had succeeded, finally, in closing down the military supply
                    relationship. I think all of us who worked on Pakistan issues felt that that was
                    not a suitable policy for us to be pursuing. Not that we wanted to stimulate an
                    arms race in South Asia, but Pakistan was a friend, and that we should open it
                    up a bit, which we succeeded in doing, I think it was in '75.</p>
                <p>But at about the same time a new issue loomed on the horizon, which came to
                    dominate our relationships with Pakistan over the next three years — that was
                    Pakistan's nuclear program.</p>
                <p>The Indians had in '72 or '73 [1974] exploded a nuclear devise. This was a
                    terrifying thing to the Pakistanis, whose security concerns revolved mostly on
                    what they perceived as a threat from India. For the Indians not only to have an
                    overwhelming advantage in conventional weapons, but to supplement that with a
                    nuclear capability was, indeed, genuinely terrifying to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>So Bhutto vowed that they would do whatever they could to duplicate India's
                    capability. I think nobody took that too seriously initially, because Pakistan
                    was not believed to have the resources or scientific capability or financial
                    resources to pull off a program like this. Again, we underestimated them very
                    seriously, because they went at it hammer and tong.</p>
                <p>By various feats of chicanery and some smart diplomacy, they set into train a
                    two-pronged program: one, to reach a nuclear explosive capability by way of
                    reprocessing plutonium and, two, by uranium enrichment.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The plutonium reprocessing plan was well known, because that was dependent on
                    assistance from the French. The French had agreed to build a plutonium
                    reprocessing plant in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>We became concerned about that capability. There was no real reason to reprocess
                    plutonium in Pakistan except for weapons capability. Pakistan had a reactor in
                    Karachi, a Canadian-built reactor, which would produce plutonium to [?], then
                    had to be reprocessed in order to be useful in building the bomb.</p>
                <p>So we started working on the Pakistanis, in various diplomatic representations,
                    to cancel that reprocessing program. And we started working on the French.</p>
                <p>The Congress got very interested in this issue and passed legislation that would
                    require the US government to cut off assistance to Pakistan, economic and
                    military assistance to any country that developed a reprocessing capability. So
                    we were in that kind of a bind with the Pakistanis.</p>
                <p>The dialogue went on for a couple of years with the Pakistanis and with the
                    French. Ultimately, the French were persuaded that the only rationale for this
                    was for a bomb, a nuclear bomb in Pakistan, and they canceled the contract with
                    the Pakistanis.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, under the pressure of the Symington amendment, we were obliged
                    to cut off economic and military assistance to Pakistan. This came later. I'm
                    really getting ahead of myself to when I was in Pakistan, back in Pakistan in
                    '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anybody in the State Department saying: After
                        all, if the Indians have got the capability, the Pakistanis certainly need
                        this for stability?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I don't think anybody said that they need it or that it was desirable.
                    There were lots of people who said initially: Well, this can't be serious. They
                    may be trying it; they'll never make it. They don't have the capability to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>That was certainly, I think, Kissinger's view at the beginning, that this can't
                    be serious. I don't know his innermost thoughts on this, but he didn't like the
                    issue and wished it had never come up, I do know that. There were many arguments
                    about how we should deal with it, but I don't recall anyone ever suggesting
                    that: Oh well, it's Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any way of trying to work on the Indians to do
                        anything, or was the cat out of the bag?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, yes, we did. We did. We did, but it was not easy. And, in fact, I
                    felt that the Indian position was just awful on this. They saw us working over
                    the Pakistanis and trying to beat them, the Pakistani program. And their
                    attitude was: Well, we don't concern ourselves with that.</p>
                <p>And it was the most cynical sort of policy — of course they were concerned. But
                    they were just happy to have us do all the beating.</p>
                <p>We tried it from different directions: Well, we aren't going to get anywhere
                    bilaterally with Pakistan, we need to do this in a South Asian context. We need
                    to get India and Pakistan to have some kind of a mutual standdown. The
                    Pakistanis were willing to entertain that kind of a policy (or so they said). It
                    never got very far, so they were never completely tested on this.</p>
                <p>But the Indian view was, and not surprisingly: Well, we're not concerned about
                    Pakistan, we're concerned about China. China's got a nuclear capability and
                    missiles that will reach us, but, by the way, our program is entirely peaceful.
                    But we're not going to make a bilateral standdown deal with Pakistan. If you can
                    get China in it, we might be interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in this period, I take it, outside of this issue,
                        relations with India were not particularly warm, close, or proper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, but they weren't bad. They were a little better than proper. I
                    think, a couple of hard knocks with the Indians... The Indians got a little more
                    realistic about us and wanted to improve relationships. And so, on certain
                    specific issues, we probably made more progress with the Indians at a time when
                    relations on a political level weren't very close or very warm. We did more real
                    business with them than we had previously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Bangladesh, was it the view that this was a basket
                        case, or that we do what we can, but this is going to be a minus in whoever
                        tangles with this problem, because of its economic problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, yes, I mean that it was going to cost money. In that sense it
                    was a minus, because there was nothing much to be gained. We had no great
                    strategic interest in Bangladesh, political axes to grind or objectives to
                    promote there. It was a humanitarian issue, essentially, but on a scale that was
                    important to us. We could not stand back and watch 75 million Bengalis starve,
                    go though that kind of a wretched process.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>So we did crank up a very substantial relief and assistance effort there, which
                    continues to this day. Although I must say they've made remarkable progress
                    towards self-sufficiency and food. They're not there, probably not close to it,
                    but they have increased their rice and wheat production enormously over this
                    period. So it's been money well spent.</p>
                <p>Henry said, “Bangladesh will be a basket case, but it won't be our basket case.”
                    Of course he was wrong. It has inevitably become ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in 1976 you went to Islamabad in Pakistan as
                        Deputy Chief of Mission. Your Ambassador was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Henry Byroade for the first year and then Arthur Hummel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had two real professionals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Two real professionals. Couldn't have been more different styles, but
                    they were marvelous people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they use you, and how did you see these two men,
                        because these were important people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, Byroade was the kind of person who had his own very special way
                    of operating. As far as he was concerned, the DCM ran the embassy and all the
                    housekeeping stuff, took care of morale problems and coordination problems, and
                    all the things that DCMs do.</p>
                <p>Byroade had been an Ambassador many times and was not interested in doing any of
                    that stuff any more (if he ever had been, I don't know). His principal concern
                    was his relationship with the leader of the country. He had done this in Egypt
                    with Nasser, he had done this in Afghanistan with the King, he had done this in
                    the Philippines with Marcos.</p>
                <p>He came to Pakistan and the relationship that he concentrated on was his
                    relationship with Bhutto, who was then Prime Minister. And he had a very good
                    relationship with Bhutto. Bhutto liked him a lot. It was sort of an avuncular
                    relationship, because Bhutto respected him, maybe even was a little intimidated
                    by him in a sense.</p>
                <p>Byroade was intimidating in the sense one felt, always, that Byroade was a
                    presence, and he was somebody who really had been around, knew a lot, had a very
                    shrewd appreciation of people and their motives, and the way things worked. So
                    he was very successful in Pakistan because of this relationship with Bhutto.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Now shortly after he left, Bhutto went under. The same kind of street
                    demonstrations and agitation that had brought Ayub down came back again to
                    Pakistan's political life and brought Bhutto down.</p>
                <p>So when Hummel came, Bhutto was gone. There was again a martial law
                    administration with General Zia. Hummel's style was totally different from
                    Byroade's. It was not as personalized. He did not play it that the key was a
                    one-on-one relationship with the chief of state. He tended to work in what I
                    suppose one would call a more traditional way, working with foreign office
                    people, occasionally seeing the chief of state on a business matter, and so on.
                    I don't know how Hummel might have played it in a different situation. If he'd
                    been there when Bhutto was there, I don't know, he might have done some personal
                    things.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, our policy at the beginning was that there ought to be a

                    was that element in it, too, probably. But I also sense (I could be wrong) that
                    this was the way Hummel would do it anyway.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, let's go back to when you first got there and
                        Bhutto was in. How did the embassy view Bhutto? You were getting from
                        Byroade and from others...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Very positively. We were disturbed by the nuclear issue. By the time I
                    got to Pakistan, summer of '76, this had moved up to the front rank of our
                    concerns with Pakistan. It was beginning to get publicity.</p>
                <p>I had only been there about a month when Kissinger made his farewell visit to
                    Pakistan at the end of the Ford Administration. He had to raise the nuclear
                    issue with Bhutto as the central issue. He didn't want to, but he had to,
                    because the Symington amendment was on the books, and our hand was being forced
                    by the Congress, if for no other reason. Also, in the election campaign, Carter
                    was making an issue of nuclear proliferation. So the heat was on.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>But we thought well of Bhutto. Bhutto had done well. He had picked Pakistan up
                    off the floor. In a political sense he had given it back some self-respect. We
                    had our own questions about the way he ran his government. He tended to be a
                    little bit more authoritarian than perhaps he needed to be, or we would have
                    liked, but it was not something that we ever raised as an issue with him. We
                    didn't consider it essentially our business.</p>
                <p>And we didn't think his economic policies were very effective. In fact, to the
                    contrary, we thought he'd kind of made a hash on the economic side. But we
                    thought he had been good for Pakistan. And in a foreign policy sense we were
                    very close. So we were happy with him. He came to believe we weren't. We were
                    disturbed by the nuclear issue, but we didn't really pin that tail on Bhutto,
                    although we might have, because it really was his program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did we feel that he felt that we were trying to
                        destabilize him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That came later. He got into trouble. They had elections early the
                    following year, early '77. We were surprised, as was the opposition itself, by
                    the strength of their support that became evident in the early months of the
                    campaign — a great outpouring of dissatisfaction with Bhutto and his government,
                    and support for this rather motley opposition.</p>
                <p>They had not expected this themselves. They thought that they could get a few
                    seats and they could do their best with that. But for awhile during the campaign
                    they thought they might even win it.</p>
                <p>By the end of the campaign, Bhutto and his people had rallied. And it was our
                    assessment that he would win the elections, but probably with reduced majorities
                    in the Parliament. Apparently what Bhutto was after was a two-thirds majority so
                    he could amend the constitution at will. Exactly what he had in mind we're not
                    quite sure, but we think he probably wanted to strengthen the position of the
                    Prime Minister, or become President again instead of Prime Minister, and maybe
                    set himself up for a more autocratic government.</p>
                <p>But to get that two-thirds, either he ordered, or some of his minions did it on
                    their own initiative, rigged the elections in the Punjab. And he won more seats
                    than he probably was entitled to. At least that was our judgement. And certainly
                    that's what the opposition thought, that they had been really cheated. So, this
                    was January of '77, the elections were held.</p>
                <p>By February, the opposition was organizing street demonstrations against Bhutto,
                    and they began to grow in size and effectiveness.</p>
                <p>One element in this was the Islamic orthodox groups, who were part of the
                    opposition but became very effective in the streets and in organizing street
                    demonstrations against Bhutto, and putting Bhutto, who was himself quite
                    secular, very much on the defensive.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>There were silly things that became issues in the election campaign. Later when
                    Bhutto came to Washington on an official visit and was entertained at the White
                    House, Mrs. Bhutto danced with President Ford, and there were pictures in the
                    Pakistani papers. Well, a Muslim woman is not supposed to dance with anybody who
                    isn't her husband, probably not supposed to dance at all, certainly not with a
                    man who's not her husband. And this was that kind of low-blow, but effective,
                    anti-Bhutto, Islamic stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like one of our campaign people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We were talking about the relations with Bhutto. I wonder if you could go back
                    over what was happening during the election period, what was our attitude
                    towards the election, and then how did this develop?</p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We liked Bhutto. We had a good relationship with him. We didn't like
                    his economic policies, but he was saying the right thing, that he was going to
                    change these in his second administration. So we were happy about that, that
                    they might get themselves together economically.</p>
                <p>We had this developing nuclear issue, but that was no reason for us to favor any
                    change in leadership in Pakistan, because we were convinced that any government
                    was going to be difficult to deal with on the nuclear issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we were talking about your contacts with the
                        opposition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We were in close contact with a broad spectrum of political leadership
                    in Pakistan. One point I was making was that this always caused
                    misunderstandings in a society like Pakistan's, where their experience with
                    democratic institutions was not very deep.</p>
                <p>The opposition itself tended to exaggerate the importance of their contacts with
                    us, and tried to interpret them as meaning that we favored the opposition
                    somehow or that we were unhappy with the government.</p>
                <p>The government viewed them with similar alarm, that we were somehow encouraging
                    the opposition, and that by just the very nature of seeing their opponents we
                    were giving them encouragement and undermining the government. And this came
                    back later, after the elections, to haunt us in a sense. Not that I would have
                    changed our way of doing this at all, but it has its risks and costs.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We thought, at the start of the campaign, that Bhutto was an absolute shoe-in
                    during the elections. And we were surprised, as was the opposition, when the
                    campaign was started, how much support the opposition seemed to have. People
                    came out in huge numbers for the opposition rallies at the beginning of the
                    campaign.</p>
                <p>This panicked the government, panicked Bhutto initially. They seemed quite
                    demoralized in the early stages of the campaign, but they pulled themselves
                    together.</p>
                <p>By the end of the campaign, our assessment was that Bhutto would win, he would
                    have a majority of seats in the Parliament, but perhaps not as great as his
                    present government. Bhutto himself seems to have wanted to get a two-thirds
                    majority, so that he could amend the constitution at will. What he had in mind
                    specifically we were never quite sure, but he may have wanted to strengthen his
                    position over the long-term and maybe even set up a succession for his daughter,
                    who is now the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Benazir Bhutto.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, when the votes were counted, he had indeed won. But there was a
                    general feeling that he had won the size of majority that he did by some
                    political skulduggery. And whether this was on his own orders or some
                    overzealous work by some of his minions in the provinces, we don't know.</p>
                <p>The consequence was that the opposition had an issue: that there had been
                    cheating in the elections. And they went to the streets to overturn the results
                    of the elections. They, in effect, used the same tactics that Bhutto and other
                    opposition people had used against Ayub — mass street demonstrations, huge
                    outpourings of people that paralyzed the country. This went on, as it had under
                    Ayub, for a period of three or four months.</p>
                <p>Bhutto began to look around for a scapegoat, somebody to blame for his troubles,
                    and blame somebody in a way that would enhance his own position. We became that
                    target.</p>
                <p>A few months earlier, when Carter was running for President, he published a
                    campaign book in which his only commentary on South Asia was high praise for
                    India (and maybe some criticism of Pakistan, I can't remember), but this was
                    avidly read in Pakistan and interpreted as meaning that the new Administration
                    was anti-Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention Carter's mother had served, at a very elderly
                        age, as a Peace Corps volunteer in India.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That's right, and Pakistanis saw this as a reason why Carter was going
                    to tilt towards India and away from Pakistan. As Bhutto got into trouble and
                    there were street demonstrations, the US government, in a highly visible way as
                    part of its human rights policy and concerns, prohibited the sale of tear gas to
                    Pakistan. This, also, was interpreted as a deliberate attempt to bring Bhutto
                    down, to undercut Bhutto in Pakistan. I don't think that was the intention at
                    all, but that's the way it was seen.</p>
                <p>Then Bhutto's supporters began to put together stories, bring stories to him,
                    about American Embassy officers going around talking to opposition leaders and
                    encouraging them in their demonstrations against Bhutto and bad-mouthing
                    Bhutto.</p>
                <p>As nearly as we could figure out in the aftermath of all of this, these stories
                    were twisted. Certainly some of the meetings had occurred, but not the content
                    that was ascribed to them by various people. Some of these stories may have been
                    invented by the opposition leaders themselves just to persuade Bhutto that we
                    were against him.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that's the kind of intrigue and cross-current that goes on in a country
                    like Pakistan and sometimes catches the US government in its net. Well, the
                    upshot was that after Ambassador Byroade had left, Bhutto, in a speech
                    nationally televised...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there as Chief of Mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, and then at that point I was the Charg�. Bhutto went on national
                    television and, speaking before the Parliament, denounced the United States for
                    attempting to overthrow him. He didn't mention us by name, but it was very clear
                    who he meant. And he cited a number of these stories of contacts between US
                    Embassy officials and opposition people. He cited, and completely distorted, a
                    couple of phone-tapped conversations between embassy officers. It was quite a
                    performance.</p>
                <p>So we were Enemy Number One. Bhutto may have believed part of it, but he did this
                    in order to rally his own troops and see if he could discredit the opposition.
                    Well, in those terms, it was a complete failure, complete failure. Of course, we
                    were very upset by this. We didn't like it at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We responded in public statements. He made this speech about eight
                    o'clock in the evening, and we all rushed down to the embassy and started firing
                    off telegrams. Because of the 11-hour time difference, we were able to get stuff
                    into Washington as they were coming into the office in the morning. And they
                    were able to get responses back to us when we returned to the office. So we had
                    a very quick turnaround.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Washington made a public statement denying that we were involved in any way in
                    trying to overthrow Bhutto. We got Secretary Vance to send a message to Bhutto.
                    It was a fairly stern, but conciliatory, message.</p>
                <p>The next day when we delivered the message, Bhutto, being a real political rogue
                    and rascal, went out in an open Jeep and drove around through Rawalpindi, and
                    had all his supporters out in the street, and he was waving this letter from
                    Secretary Vance, saying that the Americans had apologized to him. Of course, it
                    wasn't an apology at all, and we then got the department to release the
                    text.</p>
                <p>But that's the kind of thing we were going through. We, in the embassy, were
                    feeling rather put upon by all of this and thought that the US ought to take
                    quite a hard line with Bhutto.</p>
                <p>I think Vance thought that we should not. He was hearing from the Shah, who was
                    still in power in Iran at that time and was a close friend of Bhutto's and a
                    supporter. The Shah did not want to see Bhutto go under in Pakistan, did not
                    want to see a fundamentalist government come into power in Pakistan, so he was
                    counseling Vance to see what we could do to help Bhutto out. So we did not take
                    a really hard line against him publicly. We just let the thing sit.</p>
                <p>Bhutto came to realize that this was having no positive impact in Pakistan for
                    him at all, wasn't getting him anywhere, so he put out a little feeler that he
                    might want to find a way to compose our differences.</p>
                <p>He called me over one night, and just he and I and his Foreign Minister sat out
                    on his lawn (and were bitten by mosquitos) while we made the first tentative
                    steps towards getting our relationship back on some normal keel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he put it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, he didn't apologize (naturally). He defended his charges and
                    said that he had this dossier of incidents and charges. And I said, “I would
                    welcome the opportunity to see that.” I wanted to see that list so that we could
                    talk about it. Well, it was never quite forthcoming, but he said he would give
                    it to the Secretary at some point.</p>
                <p>What we arranged in that meeting was for his Foreign Minister to meet with
                    Secretary Vance in Paris. I think it was a couple of weeks hence, the Secretary
                    had to be there for some purpose, some other meeting, and met with Aziz.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>But, anyway, there was a desire on both sides to bury the hatchet and not go on
                    in this way publicly. He stopped, and his press stopped, making these charges
                    that we were trying to overthrow him, but none of it was ever retracted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you just a little operational thing. All of a
                        sudden you get these charges. You're sure they're false, but did you have
                        any feeling of: My God, is anybody (I'm particularly thinking of the CIA)
                        doing something that I don't know about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, of course, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you sit down and say: Come on, fellows, let's talk
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, we did that. We did that. I called people in and said, “Does
                    anybody know of anything that...” And I said, “This is a very delicate moment,
                    and Bhutto is going to be out looking for opportunities to prove his charges, so
                    I want everybody to be super-cautious and lay back and not see opposition people
                    at this particular point, while they've got Bhutto by the throat. Let's just
                    knock it off. We can cool it for awhile. We can pick up those contacts again. We
                    don't need to exploit these at the moment. Let's just sit still.”</p>
                <p>So the orders were out to all the Political Officers not to go see their
                    political guys and that sort of thing. One officer disobeyed the instructions,
                    came and told us about it a few days later, and I sent him home, because I had
                    assured the Secretary that we were not doing anything that Bhutto could take
                    exception to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this officer, obviously we don't want names, but was
                        this just because he or she couldn't sit still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Partly that. It was poor judgment on his part. A couple of guys showed
                    up at his door, young guys who were political contacts of his. What particularly
                    disturbed me about that particular contact was that they were fresh from a
                    demonstration where they were being chased by the police and had come into an
                    American officer's house. So I just thought he showed remarkably poor
                    judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the CIA? There is sometimes the feeling that
                        the CIA can be a rogue elephant, but I take it the atmosphere was not such
                        that you might think they were playing a different policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No. No. Not at all. Not at all. I had no reason to think that at all.
                    No. No. They were very cooperative and, in a sense, were very helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just using America as “the Great Satan.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, yes. And twisting and distorting little things that came to his
                    attention. An interesting example was what he did with these taped telephone
                    conversations that his intelligence people had intercepted.</p>
                <p>A couple of weeks before this speech, maybe three weeks before, Bhutto had gone
                    down to Lahore and had gone into a hotel and not emerged for 72 hours, while
                    there were huge demonstrations going on in the streets every day. Rumors began
                    to fly that he was about to quit.</p>
                <p>A journalist called our Consul General in Karachi (this was a source that our
                    Consul General trusted and had known for a long time) and told him that Bhutto,
                    indeed, was going to resign, and that his people wanted to know if he would be
                    welcome in the United States; would he get a visa?</p>
                <p>Well, this was at night, and it struck our Consul General in Karachi as something
                    that we needed to know about right away, and that it was a question that might
                    be posed to us in real terms very suddenly, and that we needed to get our act
                    together: What would we do if Bhutto wanted to leave Pakistan and go to the
                    United States? Would he be welcome there?</p>
                <p>So he called our Political Counselor in Islamabad and, using euphemistic
                    language, tried to describe the question that was posed. And the way he put is
                    was, “My source tells me the party is over....” So the Political Counselor then
                    called me and used much the same language to describe the issue.</p>
                <p>I think at that point I went over and saw Byroade, and we talked about it. I
                    can't remember if we sought guidance from Washington at that point or not.</p>
                <p>But, the way Bhutto used this, I think he genuinely misunderstood. The phones
                    were tapped, and he got this tape and he listened to this, and he said, “Oh,
                    they're saying I'm finished. The Americans are saying I'm finished.”</p>
                <p>So he quotes this conversation and says, “Let me tell you, gentlemen, the party
                    is not over!”</p>
                <p>There was nothing malicious in what we were doing at all — totally insincere.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>And I had another example, later, of Bhutto misunderstanding. I had a very good
                    friend whom I'd known in Lahore who was in politics, and Bhutto had just named
                    him as his Minister of Food, I think. I did a little amateur theatrical stuff
                    while I was in Islamabad, and I was going to be in a play. He called me one time
                    and we started talking about the play — it was a conversation almost entirely
                    about the play.</p>
                <p>He was then called in by Bhutto who said, “What do you mean talking to Constable
                    on the telephone about my sexual exploits?”</p>
                <p>Well, it was never in the conversation at all!</p>
                <p>Pakistani English and American English aren't exactly the same, so these bizarre
                    misinterpretations and misunderstandings come very easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in a situation which could be true in the
                        United States. When political paranoia sets in, anything can happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. Well, any Pakistani politician suffers from paranoia, and with
                    reason, because people are out to get him — at least his own opponents are — by
                    every device available. But they tend to think that American policy operates
                    that way, too. Most of the time I think it doesn't. Sometimes it probably does,
                    but in this instance, it certainly didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 7, 1990. This is interview Number Two with
                        Ambassador Peter Constable. We finished the last interview talking about
                        Bhutto trying to blame the United States for his difficulties. Let's now
                        talk about what happened after that period. Would you give the time
                        frame?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, we're in the spring of 1977. Bhutto fairly quickly found that
                    trying to shove his difficulties off on the United States, in an effort to
                    create some sort of ground swell of support based on nationalism and
                    anti-Americanism, really wasn't taking him anywhere. The opposition was not
                    cowed by this effort. In fact, there was no great anti-American rallying in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>So Bhutto began to back off from this and look for ways to reach some kind of an
                    accommodation with us. But his difficulties in the streets continued and even
                    got worse.</p>
                <p>The Saudis became very active in trying to mediate some sort of a compromise
                    between Bhutto and his political opponents. For awhile it looked as if they
                    might be successful. It was very clear that Bhutto was going to have to give
                    something very substantial, like new elections monitored in some way.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>The surprising development, I guess, was the fact that in the middle of this
                    mediation effort by the Saudis, Zia made his move and overthrew Bhutto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zia was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Zia was the Chief of Staff of the Army, who had been hand-picked by
                    Bhutto presumably because he would be dependent on Bhutto, was not senior enough
                    in the military, did not have that prestige to run the military as an
                    independent entity. And Bhutto thought that he would be dependent on him, that
                    indeed Zia did seem to be for some period.</p>
                <p>But pressures within the military were growing to do something. The thing that
                    the military has always hated in Pakistan is to be used as a force for the
                    maintenance of civil order and turn their guns on the population. And it was
                    that feeling that impelled Zia to strike.</p>
                <p>It would have been more understandable if he had made his move after a collapse
                    of the Saudi mediation effort, but he moved in the middle of it, for reasons
                    which are not entirely clear.</p>
                <p>In one of those things that happens, a series of coincidences, Ambassador Hummel
                    had just arrived in Pakistan and had presented his credentials to President
                    Chowdri.</p>
                <p>As part of his desire to cool things down with the United States, Bhutto had
                    indicated that he wanted to come to our Fourth of July party. So an effort had
                    to be made to arrange an opportunity for Hummel to call on Bhutto. Because
                    Bhutto was caught up in this very elaborate and intense political negotiation,
                    it was hard to schedule an appointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might point out, for those not aware of diplomatic
                        niceties, the Ambassador has to call on the Prime Minister pretty much
                        before the Prime Minister can come calling the other way around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Exactly. It's a protocolary point, but an important one in relations
                    between states.</p>
                <p>In any event, Bhutto's aide kept assuring Hummel that, yes, Bhutto wanted to see
                    him, and to stand by. Well, we were into July 3rd, and then into the night of
                    July 3rd, and the reception was at midday on the 4th.</p>
                <p>Finally, in the wee hours of the Fourth of July, about 12:30 in the morning, or
                    one o'clock, Hummel got his call to come and see Bhutto. So he duly trotted over
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>And the next day, Bhutto showed up at the midday Fourth of July party. And, in
                    fact, everybody was there who counted in Pakistan. The opposition political
                    leaders were there. General Zia was there. The President of the country was
                    there.</p>
                <p>I only mention this because it was that very night, about eleven o'clock or
                    midnight, that Zia made his move and overthrew Bhutto.</p>
                <p>I'm sure that there are many people in Pakistan who believe to this day that
                    somehow that peculiar chain of events, of Hummel going to see Bhutto at one
                    o'clock in the morning, Bhutto showing up at the embassy at noon and being
                    overthrown that night, was something engineered by the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask (this is obviously an unclassified interview)
                        what was our attitude towards Bhutto at that time, and were you concerned
                        (we mentioned this before in our earlier interview) about anybody within our
                        embassy community meddling around encouraging the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, not at all, not at all. We wanted to see some kind of peaceful
                    solution of this. The mediation effort that the Saudis were undertaking looked
                    promising at that moment, and we thought it stood a reasonable chance of
                    success.</p>
                <p>We were standing our distance from this. We were not seeking to involve ourselves
                    as a mediator. We were concerned by what was going on in Pakistan, because there
                    was a tremendous stand-off and disruption in Pakistan as the result of the
                    aftermath of the elections and this opposition in the streets to Bhutto. But, I
                    think as I said in the last interview, our relations with Bhutto had been very
                    good up to the point of the elections.</p>
                <p>We had one major disagreement with him, and it was an important one, over
                    Pakistan's nuclear policy. It's an issue which remains to this day.</p>
                <p>But, otherwise, we thought Bhutto had been a force for stability and had done
                    well. We didn't think his record was terribly spectacular on the economic side.
                    But we also understood that in his second administration he intended to change
                    his policies in a more market-oriented way, which we thought would be good for
                    the country.</p>
                <p>So we had no policy differences with Bhutto, with Pakistan, except over the
                    nuclear issue. And we did not think that anybody else was going to be any easier
                    to deal with. I think events have proved us right. Zia was not easier to deal
                    with on the nuclear issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, let's look at it from how the embassy reacted,
                        heard, and what you did, because I want to have somebody who's not familiar
                        with what we do... how do we operate? Here's a coup in what we consider a
                        critical country, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: One always stands back and tries to assess whether a coup is going to
                    be effective, and whether the people who have made the coup can establish order
                    and establish themselves in power. So one tends to avoid taking any steps which
                    sanction the coup.</p>
                <p>We have gotten away, as a policy matter, from using formal recognition as a step
                    following a coup. We now take the posture that relations are between states, and
                    they're a continuing matter, no matter what government is in office.</p>
                <p>But at the same time, after a coup, we tend to go rather slowly in developing our
                    relationships with the new government until we come to understand that they're
                    there to stay, that the coup has in some way been accepted and is not a resisted
                    coup or the country is suddenly in a civil war situation.</p>
                <p>As it turned out in Pakistan, the coup seemed to be welcomed. The opposition that
                    had been badgering Bhutto in the streets certainly welcomed it, and Bhutto's own
                    party seemed quite passive. They did not take to the streets and resist the
                    effects of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how you saw the actual coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The actual coup was bloodless and in the middle of the night. Some
                    soldiers marched into Bhutto's quarters, woke him up and informed him that he
                    was under arrest. There was apparently no resistance from presidential guards or
                    anything of the sort.</p>
                <p>So we did not learn of the coup until the following morning when we woke up and
                    people turned on their radios and martial music was playing. There was
                    suspension of the normal programming.</p>
                <p>I drove in to the embassy at about eight o'clock, the usual hour, and the
                    Political Officer, Arnie Raphel, who was subsequently Ambassador in Pakistan and
                    was killed there in the plane crash with Zia a year and a half ago, was waiting
                    for me in front of the embassy.</p>
                <p>He said, “There was a coup last night.” I was astonished. The timing of it, as I
                    said earlier, was totally unexpected.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>So the first thing that an embassy does in a situation like that is try to gather
                    as much information, report back to Washington, so that Washington is not any
                    more surprised, anyway, than the embassy was. And then try to assess what we
                    think the prospects are for such a government, what they might do and what the
                    impact of this would be on US-Pakistan relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did somebody from those running the coup get in touch with
                        you or did you get in touch with them? How does one establish relations with
                        this new group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I don't recall the specific steps that we took. I don't recall that
                    they immediately contacted us, although that may have happened. We may have been
                    called into the foreign ministry and been given some sort of an explanation,
                    that all embassies would have been called in. I think that's probably likely,
                    but I don't really remember that. I know for the first few days most of our
                    contacts with the government were through the foreign ministry. I mean, nobody
                    ran over to see Zia and say, “Congratulations.” But, bit by bit, of course, we
                    did hear from them, all parts of the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that Ambassador Hummel probably gathered
                        everybody together, and of course he's brand new anyway, and said, “Who is
                        this guy Zia, and who knows him?” How did you see it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: As it turned out, Arnie Raphel was the one who really knew Zia and
                    established a relationship with him when he was perhaps not even yet Chief of
                    Staff of the Army. Arnie had gotten to know him through our military assistance
                    programs and had become really quite friendly with him.</p>
                <p>Obviously, the things that Washington wanted to know were: What kind of a
                    government is this likely to be? What kind of a person is Zia? Is he likely to
                    be an effective leader?</p>
                <p>And, frankly, our assessment at the time was that Zia was a soldier and not
                    likely to be very swift as a politician, and that he'd better figure out some
                    way to turn power over to a civilian government, because he was unlikely to be
                    able to handle the thing.</p>
                <p>Of course, we couldn't have been more wrong. I think we were right initially. The
                    moves that he made politically were very clumsy, but he learned fast. Within six
                    months he had demonstrated that he really was in charge and knew what he was
                    doing.</p>
                <p>He lasted for ten years, until his death in the airplane accident. He proved to
                    be a very shrewd and astute politician, and very adept about maneuvering his
                    opponents.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>But, at the time, we thought that he had better get his act together and find
                    some way to elections and get back out of there within two or three months. And,
                    in fact, that's what he wanted to do initially. But it proved, from his
                    perspective, not possible. He arrested Bhutto; within a month he let Bhutto out.
                    And he talked about having elections in September or October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. This was early July when he was overthrown, and he talked about
                    being back out of office in three months. His calculation was that Bhutto would
                    be so discredited by revelations the government then started putting out about
                    Bhutto's misdeeds that the country could have elections and Bhutto would
                    lose.</p>
                <p>Well, that was a miscalculation, because the Bhutto phenomenon was not over at
                    all. He remained an extremely popular political figure. When he was released
                    from prison he immediately started organizing massive political demonstrations.
                    And they were huge. There were just enormous turnouts as he went to Lahore and
                    to Karachi. These terrified the government, so they had to figure out something
                    else.</p>
                <p>It became apparent if there were early elections that Bhutto would win. And that
                    would be intolerable for the Army that had just thrown him out. They had made a
                    serious miscalculation on what the effect of Bhutto's arrest would be on the
                    people's party, on his support.</p>
                <p>The kind of thing that we were saying to the government was, yes, you need to go
                    to elections, because we didn't think that Zia could handle this politically.
                    And we also felt that Pakistan needed to have democratic institutions, that the
                    only way ultimately that Pakistan could develop political stability was through
                    the exercise of a more democratic system.</p>
                <p>But Zia backed off and postponed elections. He continuously promised elections,
                    but they began to recede into a more distant future until he figured out another
                    plan. He then did, subsequently, have elections. He had some non-party
                    elections. All of this was after I had left Pakistan.</p>
                <p>After this scare for Zia, when he let Bhutto out and it became apparent that
                    Bhutto was still a highly popular figure, it was then that Zia and his advisors
                    developed the strategy of trying Bhutto for his misdeeds, and then ultimately
                    having him sentenced to death and hanging him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was hanged on April 4, 1979. What role were we playing,
                        as you saw it at the time, on these developments? This is the Carter
                        Administration; human rights was very big on our agenda; we no longer had
                        Henry Kissinger, who saw Pakistan as being vital for the China card; Carter,
                        who was probably less interested in Pakistan, perhaps more in India; it was
                        the usual Democrat-Republican thing; plus Carter's mother had served in the
                        Peace Corps in India; etc., etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: All of that is true. Those impacts of attention to human rights,
                    greater interest in India, were truer of the period up to Bhutto's overthrow, or
                    maybe a few months before that. I think some of that began to give way to a
                    slightly more r�al politique view as the Carter Administration found the world
                    more complicated perhaps than it had initially thought.</p>
                <p>The Administration was hearing from the Shah that he was interested in stability
                    in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>And, as every Administration finds, you can't quite play the game with India that
                    people like to think you can. Here's the world's largest democracy. We ought to
                    have so much in common, why can't we make common cause and be really close
                    friends?</p>
                <p>Well, the Indians had their special relationship with the Soviets, their own
                    hostilities to the Chinese, their difficulties with Pakistan, and considerable
                    animosity against the United States. So they were never a player that we could
                    quite bring into play the way some people tended to think. It just never worked
                    out.</p>
                <p>So one's attention was turned back, sometimes, to Pakistan, even though one
                    didn't quite start out there.</p>
                <p>Then, I believe it was in '78, there was the coup in Afghanistan by Communists.
                    That caused great concern in Pakistan, and in Iran, and in Washington.</p>
                <p>So there was a change. Now we didn't give up on certain basic premises. We
                    continued to believe that ultimately Pakistan had to get back to democratic
                    processes. But the way in which we dealt with that in Pakistan may have
                    undergone some subtle shift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have to remember, because right now things are changing
                        so much in the other way, we're talking about March 1990. This period will
                        probably be one of the great historic periods of, certainly, the post-World
                        War II period, but at that time we were really concerned about Brezhnev and
                        an expanding Soviet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Indeed we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk a little bit about how you saw the
                        Afghanistan business at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: If you can think of it in a larger context: The Carter Administration
                    was faced with difficulties in the Horn, in Somalia, Ethiopia, the Ethiopians
                    developing a much closer relationship with the Soviets, the Somalis being beaten
                    down in the Ogaden War, which...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in the Horn of Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: And there were those who were arguing, in a very public way, that the
                    Carter Administration was presiding over a disintegration of American influence
                    around the world, and that we were letting the Soviets take advantage of our
                    weakness. It was alleged that this is what was happening in the Horn, it was
                    happening in Angola.</p>
                <p>In that context, then, there was a Communist coup in Afghanistan, and this was
                    viewed as one more example of the Soviets on the march and US influence
                    receding.</p>
                <p>That was certainly very much the way events were seen in Pakistan by Pakistanis.
                    They were extremely concerned about this. They had counted, for decades, on, if
                    not an alliance with the US, US benevolence and influence to hold back Soviet
                    influence in South Asia and a Soviet thrust toward the Indian Ocean. So they
                    were deeply concerned about the direction of American foreign policy, and then
                    really quite panicked when the coup occurred in Afghanistan. Just by chance when
                    that happened, Art Hummel was away in Washington and I was again Charg�. I was
                    called in by either the Foreign Minister or the Foreign Secretary (I can't
                    remember what he was then) Foreign Minister Agha Shahi, I think, and asked what
                    this coup meant to the United States, and what it meant in terms of US-Pakistan
                    relations. What he was looking for was our interpretation of this coup in light
                    of the 1959 bilateral agreement with Pakistan, the US-Pakistani bilateral
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>I was able to get back to him after consulting with Washington and tell him, the
                    very next day, that we viewed events in Afghanistan with great concern. And that
                    any threat to Pakistan by a Communist-dominated or a Communist-controlled power
                    would trigger a response from the US under the 1959 bilateral agreement, which
                    did not specify what kind of action we would take.</p>
                <p>It didn't say that we would send in troops or anything of that sort, but the
                    implication was that we would, in some way, assist Pakistan militarily, either
                    with military equipment... And we would certainly use our influence to protect
                    Pakistan against a Communist threat. They found that vastly reassuring.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>But this was the kind of thing that the Carter Administration was being pushed
                    into by developments around the world. It was something of a reversal of the
                    kind of policies that the Carter Administration wanted to pursue at the
                    beginning of the administration, but events pushed them in a different
                    direction.</p>
                <p>It affected, obviously, the way we dealt with the Zia regime, too. Certainly,
                    from the moment of a Communist coup in Afghanistan, we were not going to beat
                    Zia around the ears to the point that his government collapsed. We were, from
                    that point on at least, really interested in stability in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Now we continued to believe that the long-range stability in that country
                    depended on the development of democratic institutions. But we were not prepared
                    to say to Zia, “You've got to step aside tomorrow and get on with elections,”
                    because we appreciated the political dilemma that existed in Pakistan, the deep
                    divisions between the PPP and the rest of the body politic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking ahead after your time that you dealt with it in
                        another context. Pakistan, as far as American relations —they burned down
                        our embassy. And, in a couple of days, the Soviets were bouncing into
                        Afghanistan, in December of '79. Instead of our remaining mad, we had to get
                        down to the immediate thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, that was a logical consequence of what I've been talking about.
                    But, in the meantime, other things had intervened: the collapse of the Shah in
                    Iran, and then the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we didn't have time for taking care of, you could
                        almost say, the minor matter of now protecting the embassy. How did we deal
                        with the problem of Bhutto? How did you see this? Here he is stirring up
                        crowds; Zia's got to respond. What were we doing on the ground and also from
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We were observing and reporting. We were not taking any kind of a
                    policy position on this, other than letting the Pakistan government know,
                    letting Zia know, that we thought he needed to find a way to get on to an
                    election process and get the Army back in the barracks and out of power. As I
                    say, the urgency with which that message was delivered shifted over time as
                    other things happened in the region.</p>
                <p>More difficult for us, or more painful I think for everyone, was what was going
                    to happen to Bhutto once Zia embarked on this process of a trial, a public
                    trial, and then condemned him to death.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and the embassy see, once he started on the trial
                        business, that this was the ultimate conclusion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The logic of it always seemed to me that, yes, he had to put him to
                    death, that the way Zia had constructed his own position, there was no way out.
                    There was a Punjabi saying: “Two men and one grave.” One or the other had to go
                    in it.</p>
                <p>Even as we urged him, after Bhutto was sentenced to death, to pardon him, or to
                    put him in exile, or in some way to spare him, I personally felt that the logic
                    of it was that Zia could not do that.</p>
                <p>Bhutto, out of the country, would have been forever a threat to Zia's regime.
                    Bhutto, in jail in the country, would have been a similar threat. Zia built a
                    political construct in which Bhutto had to be eliminated, which was
                    unfortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you follow through on the Bhutto business. What role
                        we were playing as this moved on its way? Were we passive the whole time, or
                        were we getting...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, we made several representations to Zia and the Pakistani
                    government urging that Bhutto's life be spared. We did not have a formula to
                    sort out the political problems in Pakistan. But we made it very clear to Zia
                    that we thought it was a mistake, that also on human rights grounds, we thought
                    he ought to be spared, although we had to be very careful about this, since we
                    have capital punishment in our own country. So the element of opposing this as a
                    human rights issue was rather muted. We put it in humanitarian terms rather than
                    human rights, and in political terms, that we thought it was a mistake for this
                    to happen. This kind of thing had never been done in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was the example of Minderas in Turkey, of the same

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Which it seemed to me was an object lesson, in the other direction,
                    for Pakistan. But it was a dilemma, because, analytically, it was difficult to
                    see how Pakistan would return to any kind of political stability while Bhutto
                    was a factor. If he returned to power, either he would have to eliminate all his
                    enemies or his enemies would be back in the street as they were just before his
                    overthrow. So it was difficult to see just how the country got itself out of
                    this dilemma.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>In a way, Zia did. He took a long time, and he moved very, very slowly through a
                    series of steps towards limited democracy, non-party elections, and constituting
                    an assembly that allowed for political expression and political debate. But
                    still there was in effect a kind of martial law on top of it with Zia running
                    things. Step by step, he moved towards a multi-party democracy. After he was
                    killed, then they moved very rapidly and held elections.</p>
                <p>The Bhutto phenomenon, obviously, still exists in that his daughter is now the
                    Prime Minister. But I think it has a different context to it now than it had ten
                    years ago. People have changed and their views have changed. Benazir, while she
                    has many of her father's qualities and political abilities, is not her father.
                    The country is not the same as it was ten years ago. It has moved on in
                    important ways. So this kind of process may work now in that Pakistan may be
                    able to go through a series of elections and develop some institutional
                    stability that it has always lacked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it apparent that the opposition group, which would be
                        at that point the Bhutto supporters, was looking to the American Embassy to
                        pull some sort of trick? Were we blamed for what was happening to
                        Bhutto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Oh, I think to some extent we were blamed, yes. There were those in
                    Bhutto's party who found it convenient to blame us. At the same time, I think
                    they could hear what we were saying, which was that we wanted to see Pakistan
                    return to elections. And I think they recognized that it was, to some extent,
                    pressure from the outside that kept Zia moving towards elected politics and
                    forced him to take some of these steps. Of course, there were internal pressures
                    that forced him to do so, also. But he kept hearing from outside.</p>
                <p>And after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, when we...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be December of '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That was December of '79. And it was not until sometime in '81 that we
                    came to agreement with Pakistan on a very large aid program, a five-year
                    program, and agreed on the sale of F-16s to Pakistan. From that point on,
                    Pakistan obviously had to be very concerned about what opinion was in the US and
                    in the US Congress.</p>
                <p>And so Zia understood that he had to hear these expressions of support for a more
                    democratic system. And he took those steps. I think, had he lived, one probably
                    would have seen something similar to the kinds of elections which were held
                    right after his death that led to Benazir coming into power — although he
                    wouldn't have liked that. He wouldn't have liked that result, but I think he
                    would have been in a position where he had to accept it.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: I left Pakistan in June of '79. At that point I came back to
                    Washington as the Senior Deputy in the Near East-South Asia Bureau. That gave me
                    responsibilities across-the-board in NEA, but I also paid a lot of special
                    attention to the South Asia side, to what I knew best.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: Hal Saunders, for the first two years that I was in the job, until the

                        away from Israel's confrontation with the Arab States. All of a sudden we
                        were looking at... And the other thing was Afghanistan and Iran, which was
                        more in your bailiwick. How did we view them and respond to
                        developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Of course the first part of the Iran tragedy had already taken place.
                    By the time I got back to Washington, the Shah was out and the revolution had
                    occurred. Washington was concerned with ways to try to put something back
                    together again and see if there was any way that we could deal with this regime
                    in Tehran.</p>
                <p>You may recall, at that time, although Khomeini was obviously the supreme power,
                    the civil government was still a secular one. Bazargan was the Prime Minister,
                    and he had non-clerical people, by and large, staffing the government. So the
                    judgment in Washington was that we should and could find, somehow, ways to deal
                    with this secular government. The seizing of the hostages, I think, was very
                    much a part of a power play within Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in November '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: In early November of '79, with the more radical Islamic fundamentalist
                    revolutionary elements seeking to enhance their power and, in effect, overthrow
                    a secular government and constitute a religious, clerical revolutionary
                    government. The hostage issue became an instrument for achieving that.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>And, indeed, within days after the seizure of the embassy and the hostages, the
                    Bazargan government collapsed and was replaced, first, by Bani Sadr, who still
                    was secular. But he was soon put on the rack, also, for his involvement in the
                    hostage crisis, and within a few months he was out.</p>
                <p>And then it was a purely religious, clerical government. Once the aims of that
                    revolutionary group were achieved, then the hostages became superfluous to their
                    purposes. And the kind of embarrassment that holding the hostages caused Iran,
                    and the pressures of trade embargoes, and political and diplomatic isolation
                    began to tell, to some extent, as well as the war with Iraq.</p>
                <p>At that point, then, Iran looked for a way to get rid of them. But, until the
                    hostages had served their purpose of accomplishing the revolutionary goals of
                    the radical Islamic fundamentalists, we really had no chance to get them
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see it as this hostage crisis developed? There
                        had been other times when the Ambassador had been taken over in the embassy.
                        Did this thing appear to be just one of those temporary blips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: In the very first few days, we hoped that that's what it would be.
                    There had been an incident in February, on Valentine's Day, as you may recall,
                    when the compound was overrun. The Ambassador was able to quickly get assistance
                    from the government to turn this around, and the compound was very quickly
                    returned to American control.</p>
                <p>So, when this happened in November there was a hope. Bruce Laingen, the Charg�,
                    was, at the time that the compound was taken over, at the foreign ministry
                    making a representation on some other issue. He stayed in the foreign ministry
                    throughout most of the hostage crisis.</p>
                <p>But in those first two or three days, he hoped to be able to persuade the
                    government to reverse itself or to disassociate itself from what had happened in
                    the compound, and to use its authority to get the guys out who had taken the
                    hostages.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there was really quite a different stamp on the takeover this
                    time. The objective of those who were engineering this, clearly, was to get rid
                    of the Bazargan government that Laingen was trying to deal with, and ultimately
                    replace it with a radical revolutionary government. So there was a different
                    context in which the takeover occurred than had been the case earlier in
                    February.</p>
                <p>As you will also recall, ostensibly what triggered this was the Shah being
                    admitted to the United States. The Shah had been in Morocco and Egypt, and then
                    the US agreed to allow him to come to the United States for medical treatment.
                    The Iranians were infuriated by that.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: It was done at a high level. We did have an input. We were asked for
                    our views, and we gave them.</p>

                        happening, either from people who'd served there or from the CIA, so you
                        understood some of the dynamics there and how this thing was pretty much
                        under control as far as the old system? Looking back on it, how well do you
                        think we were served by what we had developed there over the years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: There was quite an array of opinion, even from people who knew Iran
                    very well. I was not an Iranian expert, but it's very clear, in retrospect, we
                    underestimated the depth and the fervor of the Islamic element and their ability
                    to force the pace in Iran, and perhaps overestimated the ability of old-time,
                    secular democrats who had suffered during the period of the Shah and obviously
                    had not been allowed to participate in the political process. But they were
                    people who were known to embassy officials over the years and respected. We
                    perhaps attached more credibility to them than the facts warranted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this almost comes with the territory, doesn't it?
                        Looking at it objectively, it's very difficult for an embassy to deal with
                        quite radical groups that are anti-Western. You don't have Mullah friends,
                        really, or Ayatollah friends.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I think that's a very good point. It is hard to have those contacts.
                    It is hard to get to know these people. It is hard, therefore, to make accurate
                    assessments of what their political capabilities are and where they really
                    stand, what they really want. I think that's a very valid point. You end up
                    talking, in effect, to those who will talk to you.</p>

                        hostages have been in for umpty-ump days. This went on for 444 days. The
                        wives, whose husbands were in there, were coming and being very...move ahead

                        looking back on it maybe we should have done), the tit for tat business? In
                        other words, we had a mission, and you just take the Iranians and put them
                        in the Greenbrier Hotel, or whatever one does (we've done this before), and
                        say: Okay, now it's time, you've held our embassy, we'll hold your embassy.
                        And this puts some pressure on the other side. Was that considered at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We thought about things like that. There were some legal difficulties,
                    I think, with some of the things that you suggest, of holding hostages in the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there is... I mean, if we went through this during
                        war... We did this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Some kind of internment. Yes, I think that could have been done. There
                    was a very strong feeling, at the beginning, that there may not have been any
                    authority in Tehran that had real control of those who were holding the
                    hostages, and that for us to take retaliatory steps could endanger the hostages.
                    Now that may have been a misreading, a misassessment, but that's what people
                    thought at the time. This kind of thing was certainly talked about.</p>
                <p>We had an enormous problem of the 80,000 Iranian students in the United States,
                    some of whom, as you may recall, at that time were running around organizing
                    pro-Khomeini demonstrations in downtown Cleveland, and that kind of thing.
                    People were outraged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall that there was an interesting side to this. I was
                        in charge of our consulate general in Naples, and all throughout Europe
                        there were Iranian students who were asking for visas. The State Department
                        Visa Office, to get the pressure off, said, “Oh, give them non-immigrant
                        visas.” And we said, “Screw you. We won't.” And we didn't. It was really a
                        revolt of the consular officers. We said, “We will obey the law. We're not
                        going to put any more of these students into the United States.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I remember that, indeed. These were some of the kinds of problems that
                    we were coping with all the time. Dealing with the press, dealing with the
                    Congress, dealing with these issues of Iranian students running around the
                    United States and getting beaten up, actually, by quite understandably hostile
                    Americans who did not like to see people carrying pro-Khomeini banners down the
                    street while our hostages were held in Tehran.</p>
                <p>But each one of these issues had to be looked at, from our point of view, in
                    terms of what impact this was going to have on the hostages and on the hostage
                    crisis itself. I suppose you could say that we tended to be perhaps overly
                    careful, over cautious, in our determination to try to protect the safety of the
                    hostages.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>We were perhaps less severe with Iranian students here and the Iranian Embassy
                    here. Eventually, but it took several months, we closed the embassy here. But
                    for a long time we listened to and bought the argument that, absent anything
                    that we could usefully do in Tehran, it was important to have some voice back to
                    the Iranian government through their Iranian Embassy here in Washington.</p>
                <p>I think, in retrospect, one can say that did us no good at all. It was not a
                    useful voice. It wasn't even an honest voice in terms of honest reporting. They
                    always put their own spin on things anyway.</p>
                <p>But it was an extremely difficult time, partly because of the intense spotlight
                    that was on this crisis, and the intense pressure on the Administration, at
                    every step of the way, to do something. Within a few days after the hostages
                    were seized, we did what probably turned out to be the most important and useful
                    thing that we did though the whole thing, which was freezing Iranian assets
                    here. Because that gave us something that they wanted back.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That came as a surprise to the Iranians, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I think so, yes. Apparently it did.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: There was reluctance here to do it, and for very good reasons. We have
                    found very useful our ability to act as a repository for funds from around the
                    world. And there were those who were very, very concerned that the Saudis, and
                    other big money-earners who deposit a lot of money in the States, would be
                    alarmed if we did this to Tehran, no matter what the provocation, that the US
                    would no longer be seen as a necessarily totally safe repository for funds. So
                    that was debated for a day or so. But the need was overwhelming to do it, to
                    create some kind of a counterbalance to Iran holding the hostages.</p>
                <p>As it turned out in the end, having seized the assets, getting rid of them was
                    also very complicated, because there were all kinds of court cases that had been
                    registered in the meantime of people who had claims against Iran. And all of
                    that had to be taken care of in some way. It was extremely complex, but we were
                    able to work through all of that at the end.</p>
                <p>Within a month, we were trying to look for some kind of negotiating track that
                    might be able to do something with the Iranians. We tried to work through the
                    U.N. and Waldheim.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Waldheim was the Secretary-General of the U.N. He made a trip to Tehran in which
                    he was embarrassed, humiliated, maltreated by howling mobs of Islamic fanatics.
                    Whatever one may think of Waldheim, I must say he acted with some courage in
                    that situation. It was not a situation I would want to have been put in.</p>
                <p>But very little came of that, although that particular U.N. track became folded
                    into a bilateral negotiating thing that we got involved in with Bani Sadr's
                    government, which I think came close to success.</p>
                <p>And I say that only in this sense, that Bani Sadr, who was the elected President
                    of Iran at that time, and his Foreign Minister, Ghotbzadeh, wanted to get rid of
                    the hostage problem. We're talking about January, February, and into early March
                    of 1980. I think they wanted to do it, but in the end they were unable to swing
                    Khomeini.</p>
                <p>Khomeini seemed to give them his blessing. But then, at the critical moment, when
                    it came to the actual moment to move the hostages out of the embassy compound
                    and into a hospital, which was going to be an interim stage before their
                    ultimate release, Khomeini did not support them.</p>
                <p>And Bani Sadr was not very long after that out of office, as was Ghotbzadeh. And
                    this was, again, a step in the deepening of the revolution by the radicals, the
                    use of the hostages as the instrument for achieving that.</p>
                <p>So that was a major negotiating effort that collapsed at the last moment, and had
                    an impact in the election and primary process that was going on in the States at
                    the time.On the diplomatic side, we were trying to crank up some sanctions
                    through the Security Council. There was reluctance. Everybody always hates
                    sanctions or hates to have to do them. We were banging our European allies
                    around the ears to get them to support sanctions. And in April, indeed, a
                    limited program of sanctions was imposed.</p>
                <p>But the other track that was going on at the same time was the planning for the
                    rescue mission, which was then attempted in the middle of April. The failure of
                    the rescue mission, tragic as it was, had one positive effect. It took some of
                    the steam out of this tremendous political pressure to resolve the issue.</p>
                <p>People saw the hostage crisis, after the failure of the rescue mission, as
                    something that we were going to have to live with for awhile, that it was going
                    to take time, and that the Administration had tried just about everything that
                    seemed reasonable. So, in that sense, it gave us a kind of a respite.</p>
                <p>By that time, the crisis had gone on for about five months, and we understood a
                    good deal better than we had right at the beginning what the dynamic was in
                    Iran.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Khomeini had laid out a process for writing a constitution, electing the new
                    assembly, electing a council of ministers, and blah, blah, blah. There were a
                    series of steps that were put in place, the institutional elements of the
                    Islamic revolution. And it became apparent to us, in fact Iranians were saying
                    this, that there could be no solution to the hostage crisis until these steps
                    were complete.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead in April, it seemed to us that not much would happen before summer
                    or early fall. So we spent our time trying to broaden the sanctions, increase
                    the pressures wherever we could find ways to do it, diplomatic pressures through
                    friends, whoever would help us with this, increase the cost of holding the
                    hostages in economic terms to the Iranians until they were through this process.
                    And always letting them know, through the Swiss and through other means, that
                    any time they were ready before that, obviously, we would be ready, too. But we
                    understood it was going to be several more months.</p>
                <p>Then, in September, when we thought it was the time that things should break,
                    that was when the Iraqis invaded Iran. And, while ultimately that may have
                    increased the pressures on the Iranians to settle, in the short term I think it
                    delayed their consideration of the hostage issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about that? My initial reaction was, when
                        the Iraqis invaded Iran, it couldn't happen to a nicer group of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, that was everybody's emotional reaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't like either side, and if they did each other in,
                        the world would be a better place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Indeed. Those of us who were working on Iran and the hostage thing saw
                    it initially in narrower terms, that it was deflecting Iran's attention from a
                    solution. Just at the time when they should have been knuckling down to talking
                    to us about getting the hostages out of there, they were distracted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An obvious question to ask was, was there any American
                        involvement in encouraging the Iraqis to do something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, not at all. Not at all. No, not at all. No.</p>
                <p>Now, ultimately, I think the war brought home to the Iranians how isolated they
                    were, and that they needed both the money that we were holding in the United
                    States, the frozen assets, and they needed better access to military equipment
                    and spare parts.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>They were having a lot of trouble, and we were putting as much pressure as we
                    could on anybody who was a potential supplier to Iran. And they were feeling
                    that pinch. So the war with Iraq did increase the pressure on them to solve it.
                    But I think they were headed to solving it anyway. And in the short run it may
                    have slowed them down coming to grips with the way to solve it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving from that, we can come back, how did we feel about
                        developments in Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Within six to eight weeks, seven weeks, after the hostages were seized
                    in Iran, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan to shore up what was a collapsing
                    Communist regime in Kabul. This presented the Administration, of course, with
                    another extremely serious issue. Could I talk a little bit about the lead-up to
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I've always felt that this was an area in which we had a significant
                    policy failure, that we did not find ways to convey to the Soviets what their
                    intervention in Afghanistan would mean to US-Soviet relations, and what it would
                    mean to the Soviet position worldwide, really.</p>
                <p>Now, part of this, I think, was the context of the time. The Administration was,
                    embattled is perhaps too strong a word, in the same kinds of things that I
                    talked about earlier, problems in the Horn, problems with Cubans in Angola.</p>
                <p>You may recall that, I think it was in September, perhaps as early as August of
                    '79, there was a great rhubarb about an alleged discovery of a Soviet battalion
                    in Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Senator Frank Church, who was running for reelection in Idaho, which
                    he subsequently lost, suddenly surfaced this illusory Soviet battalion in
                    Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was a brigade.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: A brigade, whatever. There were also problems with Sandinistas, and
                    Soviet support for Sandinistas, or Cuban support for Sandinistas, in Nicaragua.
                    So all of these things were on President Carter's plate at this time. They were
                    impinging on the dialogue with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>Carter had concluded a disarmament agreement, a nuclear weapons control
                    agreement, with the Soviets, which was supposed to go up to the Senate. There
                    were those who said it was in trouble. It was called SALT II. There were those
                    who felt there was opposition in the Congress to this agreement. Part of that
                    opposition was stimulated and fed and confirmed by what were seen as Soviet
                    incursions in Africa, in the Caribbean, in Central America. So these issues were
                    burdening the dialogue with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>My sense at the time was, although I was not directly involved in US-Soviet
                    affairs, that the Soviets were behaving a little bit arrogantly and were not
                    taking seriously American representations on these issues.</p>
                <p>There was a disposition in the government in that summer of '79 and early fall,
                    number one, not to believe that the Soviets would intervene in Afghanistan, and
                    then, number two, because the dialogue was already so freighted with things that
                    we were having trouble getting the Soviets' attention on, nobody wanted to raise
                    Afghanistan with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>It was very late in the game, probably late November, early December, before we
                    started saying things to our allies and to the Soviets against a Soviet
                    intervention in Afghanistan, trying to warn the Soviets off.</p>
                <p>I don't think we had the kind of full and frank dialogue that we should have had.
                    I don't think the Soviets ever understood, before they intervened, just what our
                    reaction would be, and how Carter would be absolutely forced to take a number of
                    very drastic steps against the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't your particular area, the Soviet Union, but was
                        there a problem of whom to talk to? Brezhnev was getting pretty dotty, in a
                        way...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: It could be. It could be. It could be. I was really not privy to just
                    exactly how we carried on the dialogue with the Soviets, but certainly you're
                    right. It was a group in Moscow that perhaps did not have the kind of leadership
                    that we could plug into easily. It may have been getting too diffuse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we react then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, this was of course seen as a
                    major challenge to the United States. We saw Pakistan as in quite an exposed and
                    weak position. We were even more fearful that the Soviets could follow up an
                    intervention in Afghanistan with some kind of an intervention in Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was much talk about “drive for a warm-water
                        port.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Drive for the warm-water port seemed to have been a Soviet ambition
                    from Imperial days. And I think it probably was. Not that they were necessarily
                    going to invade Pakistan to do this, but had they succeeded in consolidating
                    their position in Afghanistan, and, given their relations with the Indians, they
                    would have been in a position to put a tremendous political squeeze on Pakistan.
                    I think Pakistan would have had a very hard time resisting them. Now, whether
                    the Soviets really would have found useful an effort to develop a port in
                    Baluchistan, who knows. But they might have, and, in an important strategic
                    sense, outflanked the whole Gulf area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to get a little idea of this thinking. Looking at
                        it in later times, it's easy. But the geography hasn't changed. And if
                        anybody looks at the geography of that area, some of the most inhospitable
                        areas of the world, whereas the Soviets are doing very nicely, thank you,
                        with the Black Sea and going through ports... What's the big deal about...
                        Was anybody saying this? Or was this just part of thinking that warm-water
                        port always sounds...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That was not an argument or a discussion that was pursued very far.
                    Nobody expected to see the Soviets trying to build a port in Baluchistan in the
                    near or foreseeable future, but it was the idea of having Pakistan in a position
                    where it had to succumb to Soviet pressure.</p>
                <p>Given the problems in Iran, there was a concern about the US being outflanked in
                    the whole Persian Gulf area. That if you have Pakistan swinging away from a
                    relationship with the US towards a more pro-Soviet stance in Iran (with which we
                    could hardly speak, let alone have any kind of a constructive relationship) in a
                    terrible state of flux, and regimes that were of concern to us all though the
                    Gulf in this period, particularly in this period of religiously promoted
                    turmoil... Nobody knew what was going to happen in Saudi Arabia or in all of the
                    little Gulf States, in Kuwait... [TAPE ENDED]</p>

                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Maybe our response would have been much the same under any
                    circumstances. But one can, I think, also plausibly make the argument that the
                    response could also have been conditioned by the fact that we were in such
                    difficulty in Iran.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The Administration was feeling the heat from charges that it had allowed the
                    Soviets to develop a strong position in the Horn of Africa and in Angola and in
                    Central America. So there was a feeling, again, that the Soviets were on the
                    march and we were somehow in retreat.</p>
                <p>Once the Soviet forces intervened directly in Afghanistan, it seemed like the
                    throwing down of a gauntlet, in a sense. This was the first time, outside of
                    Eastern Europe since the end of World War II, that Soviet troops had been
                    deployed outside of the Soviet Union in a direct confrontation.</p>
                <p>So we spent the whole Christmas holidays wrestling with what kind of responses
                    the US and its allies should make to this. I recall going with Warren
                    Christopher and a group of people from...</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: We went off to Europe, particularly, to meet with the NATO Foreign
                    Ministers to discuss Afghanistan, and to try to get agreement on a series of
                    sanctions against the Soviet Union, responses.</p>
                <p>These ranged from a boycott of the Moscow Olympics, which were coming up later
                    that year, to cutting off all credits to the Soviet Union for certain kinds of
                    imports or construction projects, like a big Soviet natural gas pipeline across
                    Europe, canceling Aeroflot routes into various places, things of that nature.
                    There was a whole string of those.</p>
                <p>Well, again, as I made the observation earlier, whenever you start talking
                    sanctions with anybody, there's always a lot of resistance, because you're
                    goring somebody's ox, and somebody's going to lose some money. I think there was
                    general shock in Europe at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they see this as being something more than just
                        strafing the border?. Did they feel that this might mean something within
                        Europe, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, indeed. Indeed. That's right. I think they felt that if the
                    Soviets were able to get away with this and there were no particular reactions
                    from NATO countries, Western countries, there could be very serious implications
                    for this, over time, in Europe. They were really quite shocked by this. So, on a
                    political level, they wanted to see a strong response, too. But there was always
                    an issue of exactly what that should be.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we had trouble because we were selling wheat to the
                        Soviets. Ronald Reagan, in his campaign, made a big deal about who would
                        sell wheat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That's right, but for that first year we cut off wheat sales. Then we
                    tried to badger the Canadians and the Australians and the Argentines into
                    following suit. Had a lot of trouble, had a lot of trouble. Which made it easier
                    for Reagan to campaign on this, because you could make the argument, quite
                    plausibly, that we were just punishing American farmers, and the Soviets were
                    getting all the wheat they wanted anyway. These are the hard things that you get
                    involved in.</p>
                <p>I think Carter was quite courageous in taking that step, whether it turned out to
                    be politically smart or not. But it was a strong response. And we needed to do
                    some things ourselves that would persuade our allies that they needed to do some
                    things, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see this becoming a real problem for the Soviets,
                        or did we think the Soviets could probably do this and take it over? How did
                        we feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: This was debated for a long time within the Administration. There were
                    two schools of thought: one, that, yes, Afghanistan really could be a kind of
                    Vietnam War for the Soviets, that Afghans were fiercely independent, and were
                    fierce fighters, and they could hide up in those hills and shoot away. I think
                    most people felt that if the Soviets were prepared to put the numbers in and
                    bring to bear the power which we thought they could, they would eventually
                    subdue it.</p>
                <p>The immediate policy decision out of all this was to make it costly for them. It
                    was very early on that the program of assisting the freedom fighters in
                    Afghanistan was initiated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did this policy... Was the Near Eastern Bureau
                        involved in the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any internal debates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Very little. I think everybody agreed. The debate really centered on
                    to what extent this might be effective.</p>
                <p>It was, I can't remember when, but maybe a year, maybe 18 months, before lots of
                    people began to think: Well, gee, not only can you make it expensive for the
                    Soviets, but maybe they never really will fully control this.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>It was much later in the game, and long after I had left it, that there was any
                    plausibility to the argument that you might even force the Soviets to withdraw.
                    Nobody believed that initially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But now, just to get a little of the mood. After the
                        surprise invasion... I assume it was pretty much a surprise, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, no. It was not a surprise to me. There were those among the
                    Sovietologists who argued that the Soviets would never do this. But what was
                    happening in Afghanistan, it seemed to me, made it absolutely inescapable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what was happening before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: After the coup of '78, you had a self-declared Communist regime in
                    Afghanistan. These were all people who were prot�g�s of the Soviet Union. They'd
                    been trained in Moscow. They were dependent on the Soviet Union. They went into
                    a revolutionary reform program with a great deal of zeal, of land reform, and
                    closing down mosques, and secularizing what was a profoundly Islamic
                    society.</p>
                <p>And they ran into trouble. They ran into trouble with a very conservative rural
                    population. It wasn't very long before there was armed resistance to these
                    reforms, and that began to grow.</p>
                <p>And there was a disintegration of the Afghan army. The Afghan army began to lose
                    battles with these fighters out in rural areas. It looked as if this Communist
                    government in Kabul would collapse without some sort of external support.</p>
                <p>Remember this was Brezhnev time, still. You had a Brezhnev doctrine in which the
                    Soviets had declared that they, in effect, would not permit a reversal of a
                    Communist regime anywhere in the world. And when the chips were down they
                    marched in to save a Communist government.</p>
                <p>Not to save individual people, because, in effect, they pulled a coup against
                    Amin, who was president at the time. And they either killed him or had him
                    killed, and replaced him with their own stooge, Babrak Karmal. So that's what
                    was happening.</p>
                <p>There was division within the US government whether the Soviets would do it or
                    not. I think by the middle of November there were more believers, perhaps, than
                    non-believers, the way things were happening.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>So, perhaps the actual timing of the Soviet intervention was not known to us
                    until about 24 hours before it happened — one could see a build-up of planes in
                    certain parts of the Soviet Union, troop carriers, and that kind of thing — but
                    I don't think we were surprised that an intervention happened, by the time it
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in looking at responses at this time, just to get a
                        little of the mood... I take it then that particularly in the Near Eastern
                        Bureau... I mean you were already going through this tremendous trauma of
                        Iran, and to see this... You were feeling sort of bloody-minded, weren't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Oh, you bet!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stick it to whoever...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Well, there was that, yes. There was indeed that kind of a feeling,
                    because not only did we have the Iran thing but, as part of the Iran thing, the
                    American Embassy in Islamabad had been burned, and people were killed in that
                    episode. We had the burning of our embassy in Libya. We had to withdraw our
                    people from there. And then, because things were so uncertain in the area and
                    people were getting so inflamed, we decided to do a general evacuation
                    throughout the whole bureau. We pulled more than 1,000 dependents out of the
                    area. So we did a massive evacuation, too, which was traumatic for a lot of
                    people in a lot of posts. And then on came the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
                    so we felt embattled and bloody-minded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, moving on. How did you yourself view the changeover
                        to the Reagan Administration? Going from a Carter to a Reagan is quite
                        something, but I'm speaking about within the department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The transition, as you probably heard from other people, was a very
                    brusque one. The Reaganauts came in determined to erase all vestiges of that
                    horrible, weak-kneed Carter Administration, and so on. They were tearing
                    people's names off the doors. They didn't want a single Assistant Secretary's
                    name left on a door who had served the Carter Administration. We all thought
                    that was, obviously, a bit crude and sort of embarrassing to some people,
                    individuals like George Vest, who was still there. It was unnecessary to do that
                    kind of stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I personally was not unhappy to see a new broom try some things. I really thought
                    that in some ways, although the policy was changing by the end of the Carter
                    Administration, the Carter Administration had been much too kind of dreamy in
                    its policy. I personally have the greatest respect for President Carter and for
                    his abilities, but I think he got off on some wrong tracks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is just something as an aside. I think that for many
                        of us in the Foreign Service, who are often accused of being leftish
                        liberals and all this, we viewed Carter and all... We're up against the fact
                        that good works, as you were talking about with India, no matter what you
                        do, India remains India, and there isn't an awful lot of room to play with.
                        And most of us who deal with these countries, there isn't the room that
                        goodwill will bring. And for this reason, the Carter Administration at that
                        point (in retrospect it looks a lot better) was not really terribly popular
                        with the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I think not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even the human rights business was sort of grating. I
                        think probably it's the greatest legacy he left.</hi>

                <p>CONSTABLE: Indeed, I think you're right.</p>

                        at the time I was in Korea, and it was a pain in the neck. We had other
                        things to worry about than human rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: It was a rather abrupt change in emphasis in American policy, and so
                    it was difficult to deal with, very difficult to deal with. I think the
                    personalities who were in charge of this were particularly abrasive.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: I think people felt, I certainly felt, that we had at the top a very
                    able man who knew a good deal about foreign policy and was experienced. As it
                    turned out, I think he presented very special problems for the Near East-South
                    Asia Bureau, which had really not foreseen. I think he came... Should I say this
                    on tape?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you say it on tape. We can take it out, but,
                        really, I think it's important.</hi>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I think he came with a very special agenda on the Middle East. And I
                    think it had to do (this could be terribly unfair, but this is my reading of it)
                    with his own domestic political ambitions. That he hoped to somehow convert
                    being Secretary of State into a run at the presidency. And that he saw as an
                    element in this, getting solid, solid support from the American Jewish
                    community, which always contributes a great deal of money and effort to politics
                    in the United States. And that the way to do that was through a very strongly
                    pro-US policy towards Israel.</p>
                <p>Now all administrations, I think, pursue a pro-Israeli policy — and with good
                    reason. There are many reasons for doing so. But I think Haig was taking it
                    beyond a point that other Administrations had done so. And my reading of it is
                    that it had to do with his own political ambitions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because he didn't come with any particular background in
                        that area. He was a NATO man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Not particularly. No. No. No. No. But it gave us a lot of
                    difficulties.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The green light. I think he probably did, with body language, at
                    least, if not anything more explicit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, it indeed was. There was that, but, more fundamentally, there was
                    this whole concept of strategic cooperation with Israel.</p>
                <p>And I personally think that that's all a kind of a myth, that somehow Israel
                    would be our aircraft carrier in the Middle East in an otherwise unreliable or
                    hostile area. There's just really nothing to it.</p>
                <p>The Israelis don't want to be that kind of an instrument for us. They saw
                    strategic cooperation in a reverse thing, that they could get a lot out of the
                    U.S. in terms of additional assistance and cooperation. And so they used this
                    concept for their own ends. But I don't think there was anything particularly in
                    it for us.</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: Happily, it happened about two months after I left the bureau to go to
                    Zaire. But for months before that, we had a kind of a Sunday drill. We'd all get
                    called at home that there were disturbing signals that the Israelis were about
                    to invade Lebanon, and we'd all rush down to the Department. We had a standard
                    drill, practically a form telegram that we would put together and send up for
                    Haig to send off to the Israelis telling them not to do it.</p>
                <p>This went on, as I said, weeks and weeks, and then finally they did it. But by
                    the time they did it, I had gone. But we were doing constant contingency plans
                    in the event of, and that sort of thing. It was a big wheel-spinning exercise
                    that went on for a long, long time. Very time-consuming, energy-consuming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder, should we move off this and move to Zaire
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Sure, sure, if you'd like to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of other things, but were there any other
                        areas that we might cover? Let me just ask this one question. How important
                        did you view the Israeli lobby and the political influence on our dealing?
                        Was there a difference between the Carter and Haig Administration, other
                        than what you alluded to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Other than what I alluded to, I think not. There is a very strong
                    group on the Hill that is very responsive to the interests and concerns of
                    Israel. They are also willing, I think, to try to put as much balance in this as
                    long as Israeli concerns and interests are taken care of, they're also willing
                    to support Egypt, and they're willing to listen sympathetically to problems
                    about Jordan, and so on. So I don't mean that it's all one-sided. It is not
                    that, at all. But there is a very strong pro-Israeli lobby that is very
                    effectively organized and uses its clout with great effect with members.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you were then appointed as Ambassador to Zaire. You
                        were there from '82 to '84.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. I arrived in Zaire sometime in October in '82, and I was there
                    almost two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you get the appointment? After all, here
                        you'd been over in one area, and all of a sudden you're... And it's not a
                        minor country. I've seen the pattern where some of these are kind of like
                        tombstone ambassadorships. You know, end of a career, we'll make you
                        Ambassador to Upper Volta or something for a year or two. But Zaire is not
                        that. Zaire is an important country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. Well, Personnel had me on their list of people who were ready to
                    go out. They had talked to me initially about Zimbabwe. There was nothing
                    opening up in the Near East-South Asia area.</p>
                <p>In fact, over that year, if I had decided to stay in Washington another year and
                    wait, maybe something else would have come available. But at the time there
                    wasn't.</p>
                <p>So we had talked about Zimbabwe, and I had said I was interested. And then it
                    turned out the person who was there was not leaving, was staying another
                    year.</p>
                <p>So I was just called one day and asked if I would be interested in going to
                    Zaire. That was coming open a little earlier than had been anticipated. I
                    thought about it a little bit, and I said, “Sure.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You don't have to go if you don't want to, because it's known as a
                    difficult post where we have a troubled relationship, always, with Mr.
                    Mobutu.”</p>
                <p>Indeed, it was one of these periods of trouble where he was on his high horse a
                    little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain about the period when you arrived, and
                        particularly how you saw Mobutu, because he was pretty much Mr. Zaire, still
                        is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: And still is, and has been for 25 years. Well, as I say, it's been an
                    up and down relationship with Zaire. It's essentially a close one, but Mobutu
                    gets concerned that we don't pay enough attention to him. He gets angry. We, or
                    parts of the US government, get angry with him, charge him with corruption and
                    violations of human rights, and slash our assistance to him.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>So there's a lot of tension in the relationship all of the time, and this spills
                    out into the diplomatic relationship. He may get hostile to a particular
                    Ambassador and send him home, or tell the department he wants him recalled, and
                    that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>One goes to Zaire and confronts the man with a certain degree of trepidation.</p>
                <p>Things had really been going very badly in Zaire by the time I got there. They
                    were economically on the floor. Their credit was terrible. They had had
                    agreements with the IMF and programs, and so on, but had violated all of them.
                    And so the IMF didn't trust them any more, didn't want to deal with them. The
                    World Bank still made some loans, but they were getting tired of it. All their
                    bilateral partners were tired of Zaire's performance. And the US Congress was
                    tired of it. Our aid levels were down very low, very little, and everybody
                    regarded any money to Zaire as just kind of down the rat hole. And the Zairians
                    were seen as not doing anything for themselves to shape up their economy. At the
                    same time, for political reasons, reasons of geography, we thought Zaire was
                    important. We valued our relationship with Zaire and wanted to have a good
                    relationship with Zaire, but also wanted Zaire to begin to get hold of itself so
                    it wouldn't spin down into some kind of chaos.</p>
                <p>You look at the map and here is this huge country, which is as big as the US east
                    of the Mississippi, plop in the middle of Africa. What happens in Zaire
                    potentially has important repercussions through the area.</p>
                <p>So, before I went, we talked around in the African Bureau and in the department,
                    tried to hammer out a policy, which we did. The principal element in that was to
                    try to get Zaire back into a program with the IMF.</p>
                <p>Everybody who knew anything about Zaire, who had served there, who knew Mobutu,
                    said, “This is mission impossible, it can't be done.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, if we can't do it, if we can't get them in, we aren't going to be
                    able to do anything else with them. Our relationship is going to be really
                    strained. They are going to continue to disintegrate as a country, and there
                    isn't going to be anything that we can do about it. We aren't going to be able
                    to get any money from the Congress, no support, nobody's going to want to do
                    anything for Zaire unless they will do something for themselves. If they will do
                    something for themselves, then it is possible to get an IMF program, and then
                    you can get some more assistance from others and get Zaire on the right path
                    again.”</p>
                <p>So that's what I went out to try to do, with everybody saying it can't be done.
                    My arrival coincided with an understanding in Zaire and among Mobutu's advisors
                    that they really had sunk pretty low, and that they needed to do some things.
                    So, I came with the right message at the right time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about his advisors. He listened to people within
                        his government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Oh, indeed. Oh, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of these charismatic, or whatever it is, are so
                        autocratic that they don't listen to anybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, Mobutu listens to a lot of people. Sometimes maybe he listens too
                    much, I don't know, because he has in the past taken some terrible advice.</p>
                <p>A number of years ago, a Belgian Socialist bent his ear and got him to
                    nationalize everything in the country, which was just a disaster. No matter what
                    you may feel about free-market economies and Socialism, in the Zairian context
                    it was just a massive disaster, because there was nobody who could run these
                    businesses, and they just completely flopped. He destroyed the economy in a
                    stroke on the advice of this Belgian Socialist. One wishes he had not
                    listened.Anyway, that was part of what they were trying to recover from, this
                    horrible disaster that had occurred in the mid-70s, I think.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was my message. Now I started delivering it as soon as I got there,
                    and discovered that it indeed did fall on receptive ears.</p>
                <p>Now people back in Washington remained skeptical as I would report that people
                    were beginning to say the right kind of things, and that they did want an
                    agreement with the IMF, and they were willing to bite the bullet on this, and do
                    that and the other thing. People would say: Oh, we've heard that before, and
                    then they don't do it, they don't perform. So there was a great deal of
                    skepticism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, too, that your not being an African hand was
                        sort of... I mean they said: Well he's a new boy on the block and he really
                        doesn't understand Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: There probably was some of that back in Washington, yes. Fortuitously,
                    I had only been there about a month and the Vice President came on a visit, on a
                    swing through Africa. Bush was then Vice President, and he came into Zaire. So
                    we were able to load him up with all of these talking points about: How we want
                    to help you, Mr. Mobutu, and you are a good friend, and we've always had a good
                    relationship, but we can't do anything unless you do some really hard and
                    difficult things. That went very well, Bush's visit. Mobutu liked that.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Then they sent a team to Washington of a small group, maybe half a dozen of
                    Mobutu's really close advisors. And Washington, at the working level, Assistant
                    Secretaries and Frank Wisner and people at AID and people at Treasury and up on
                    the Hill, all hammered this message home.</p>
                <p>And they came back and sat down with Mobutu and said, “You've really got to do
                    something, and our only hope is if you do.”</p>
                <p>So he was having some kind of a big political party confab shortly thereafter,
                    and announced a whole series of reforms, an anti-corruption drive, which didn't
                    go very far. But it did do one important thing. It, in effect, closed off the
                    national treasury to the major raids, which had been so common before. Ministers
                    were no longer able to just take their budget and put it in the Swiss bank
                    account. So that was helpful.</p>
                <p>Started a process of negotiation with the IMF, and that process took about a
                    year, I think, nine months, to work out an agreement. And this involved some
                    really hard things. They had to devalue the currency, going from about six
                    zaires to the dollar up to 30 all in one stroke, and then let the currency float
                    and have a free exchange rate control the budget — all of those hard things that
                    IMFs make you do.</p>
                <p>Through the whole process of discussion and negotiation there were a lot of
                    skeptical people who said that, number one, he won't agree to it, and even if he
                    does agree to it, he'll never keep it.</p>
                <p>But he did agree, and he more or less kept it. They still have a program. There
                    have been some ups and downs on it, but they still have an IMF program, we are
                    now, five years later.</p>
                <p>So that was my mission, and — mission accomplished. We were able to get Mobutu to
                    do these difficult things and be a little more relaxed on some of the human
                    rights things.</p>
                <p>He was trying to curry favor in the United States and create a favorable
                    impression, so he was wooing his opposition. Instead of throwing people in jail,
                    he was bringing them back from exile and giving them government jobs again.</p>
                <p>He was willing to deal with anybody. You could never go too far as an opponent of
                    Mobutu. You could always come back, if you would recognize his supremacy. If
                    you'd recognize his supremacy, you could have views on a whole lot of things.
                    But you couldn't challenge him. When you challenged him, then you were out. But
                    if you were willing to accept that he was going to be the supreme leader, then
                    you could come home and make your peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would it be fair to say, I'm talking about your
                        relationship with the African Bureau, that, in a way, although you had your
                        mission, you were left somewhat alone? I've been told by people there that
                        under Crocker the whole emphasis of the African Bureau was on South Africa.
                        The Reagan Administration was South Africa, period, and the rest of it you
                        did your business and did what you were supposed to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: This was pretty true. Crocker didn't want to get involved in Zaire,
                    but he attached some importance to trying to keep things from falling apart. So
                    he gave the Zaire account, as he always put it, to Frank Wisner. And I needed
                    somebody back in Washington to work on some of these things for me, because I
                    couldn't do it alone from Zaire. I very quickly found that nobody in Washington
                    wanted to hear about Zaire. They didn't want to touch it. They didn't want to
                    talk about it. Zaire was poison.</p>
                <p>So when we were getting to the point where something was happening in Kinshasa,
                    and Mobutu was indeed doing some of the things that we wanted him to do, it took
                    some intervention in Washington, which Frank supplied, to get the US government
                    and the IMF to deal with this new reality and react to it in a positive way.</p>
                <p>So, while your observation was generally correct, Frank Wisner really did involve
                    himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's always interesting when somebody comes from another
                        area to deal with a bureau that they haven't dealt with before. Did you get
                        any impression of the African Bureau at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. I thought the leadership was exceptionally able. Chet Crocker and
                    Frank Wisner are brilliant and clever people.</p>
                <p>I always thought Crocker's constructive engagement policy was a brilliant
                    concept. I'm personally very pleased to see that it has borne some fruit,
                    indeed. I wish it had borne more while he was still there to reap it, but it's
                    still his basic concept that's at play, and some good things are now happening.
                    It's taken a long time, perhaps longer than people wanted.</p>
                <p>Frank Wisner is a delight. He knows absolutely everybody in Washington and is one
                    of the most effective bureaucrats I've ever seen. So, Frank is a person you want
                    on your side of the issue if you can possibly arrange that.</p>
                <p>That said, I think the bureau was not as strong as other bureaus. At the working
                    level there are a lot of people who weren't terribly effective.</p>
                <p>I think too much of the African Bureau is infected with what I would call
                    feel-good liberalism, that here are all these poor suffering Black people, we
                    must do something for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>There's every reason to be sympathetic, but you can't base policy on those kinds
                    of things. There have to be other bases in US self-interest that go beyond the
                    humanitarian.</p>
                <p>For one thing, I think you do no favor to African countries to try to postulate
                    policy on: Oh, you poor people, let's help you. It has to be quite a different
                    basis if they're going to do some of the things that really need to be done if
                    they're to progress themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our policy in Angola impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: While I was in Zaire, not nearly as much as it had before and it has
                    subsequently. This was the period when Crocker was still going around trying to
                    get something going on Angola. There were bits of dialogue, and the Zairians, of
                    course, were very interested. So we talked to them about what was happening in
                    Angola, and occasionally would ask them to talk to somebody or convey something
                    or underscore a point.</p>
                <p>But this was the period of the Clark amendment. There were no arms being run
                    around across borders and so on. So it was not, as I say, an intense
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your period, your work was really concentrated
                        on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: It was very much focused on the issues of getting them into an IMF
                    program and trying to turn them around on the economy, trying to get them to
                    curb the excessive corruption, and on human rights. And I think on all three
                    scores we made some headway. I don't think we revolutionized the country,
                    but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of this though does represent an interesting thing.
                        Here we are, you're an Ambassador from another country to another country,
                        and yet we're really talking about major pressure — the role the United
                        States has played and continues to play in other places. To me, it's not
                        only a very positive, but it's also a very active role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, it was active, but I like to think of it as perhaps less
                    intrusive than what your question implies.</p>
                <p>We weren't really putting pressure on Zaire, we were trying to explain to Zaire
                    the way the world works. And if you want to get something done, if you want more
                    out of the US in terms of aid and so on, you've got to clean up your act in
                    significant ways, and some very basic things have to happen. And not only is it
                    in terms of your relations with us, but it's just the health of your own
                    country. You're going down the rat hole, and if you want to reverse that, there
                    are certain things that have to be done for your own good.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>And we were very careful to say, actually, that there may not be any great
                    pay-out from the United States. We've got budget problems, and our foreign aid
                    is certainly not going up, and you may not get anything out of this. You'll get
                    some goodwill, and your image will be better, and people will look upon you more
                    kindly, instead of as some sort of pariah out there who's messed up a beautiful
                    country.</p>
                <p>So it wasn't that we came in and started beating around. The process of doing
                    this was also deliberately non-intrusive.</p>
                <p>All those messages about: You've got to devalue, you've got to control your
                    budget and so on, those were all delivered by the IMF.</p>
                <p>They weren't delivered by Peter Constable going in and seeing the central bank
                    guy. We would say to the central bank guy, to Mobutu, you have no choice except
                    somehow come to grips with the IMF. But we were not providing the prescription,
                    except in the broadest sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were acting almost as a friend in court or
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. And at the end, when at the negotiating level with the IMF they
                    had agreed to all the hard things, then we did use our political influence to
                    get a somewhat hostile, many-times-burned IMF board to approve the program. And
                    the head of the IMF, who had been burned so many times by Mobutu, was also gun
                    shy, but we used our influence then, when Mobutu had committed his government to
                    do these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the point where we usually say “And then you
                        retired...” and then we run off, but actually you took on a very interesting
                        job. I wonder, in the first place, did you retire ready to retire? How did
                        this work? And then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: While I was in this second year in Zaire, I basically felt I had done
                    what I set out to do. From then on, in terms of that mission, it was sort of
                    watching what they did and trying to encourage them to stay on the program. But
                    the most challenging part of it had been done.</p>
                <p>My friend, who was Director General of the Multinational Force and Observers
                    headquartered in Rome (the peacekeeping organization that had been established
                    to oversee the security provisions of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty), was
                    assassinated...</p>

                <p>CONSTABLE: Ray Hunt. ...probably by Red Brigades.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really for no particular... not really closely tied to

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No. I think there was probably a revenge element and perhaps a
                    mistaken identity. You remember the General Dozier case?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The American General that the Red Brigades had seized in Italy. The
                    Italian government found out where Dozier was and rescued him, and arrested a
                    lot of Red Brigades. In the statements that were put out by terrorists after Ray
                    Hunt was killed, they kept referring to him as “General Hunt,” not Director
                    General Hunt. My surmise is that they thought he was an American military man,
                    and that they were seeking to get somebody in revenge for the liberation of
                    Dozier. Other than that, I really don't know.</p>
                <p>Anyway, this was an organization that I was interested in, and obviously working
                    in an area in which I was interested. So I let the department know that I would
                    be interested in taking that on if they were looking for somebody to replace
                    Ray. And of course they were, and I said, “Fine.” In order to do that it was
                    felt that I should retire from the Foreign Service...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: That was 1984, so I was 52. ...that I should retire, because this was
                    an international organization and, although the US had organized the MFO, put it
                    together and provided a third of its budget, we didn't want to be seen by the
                    other participants as completely controlling it as a US government. So that I
                    would be able, if I retired, to act as an autonomous person. So I did, I agreed
                    to do that.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons was, having been Ambassador in a fairly big country like
                    Zaire, I just wasn't sure I wanted to try to do a succession of ambassadorships.
                    And this was something that was interesting.</p>
                <p>I had always thought that I would try to retire early, that there must be a third
                    of one's life beyond work, that one should do other things and exploit other
                    interests. So I did that as a kind of transition to retirement.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Mike Sterner was perhaps the key man in setting it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mike Sterner set this up, and so that would be an
                        interview that somebody might want to refer to on some of the genesis of
                        this. Could you explain what it was about and what you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: As I said earlier, it was established to oversee the security
                    provisions of the Camp David Accords, the peace treaty between Egypt and
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>The peace treaty initially envisaged a U.N. force that would be placed in the
                    Sinai. But because of Arab hostility to the Camp David Accords, and Soviet
                    support for that opposition, it became apparent that it would not be possible to
                    get Security Council authorization for a U.N. force.</p>
                <p>President Carter and Begin and Sadat had foreseen this possibility during the
                    negotiations. And Carter had provided a side letter that in the event the U.N.
                    did not put in a peacekeeping force, the US would try to organize a
                    multinational force that would do the peacekeeping in the Sinai. And so, indeed,
                    that is what came to pass.</p>
                <p>And Mike Sterner was involved in this process of negotiating a protocol between
                    Egypt and Israel for the establishment of the MFO, and then negotiating with a
                    number of countries for their participation in the MFO.</p>
                <p>The end result was the creation of a force of about 2,700 military people who
                    would be stationed in the Sinai, coming from ten different countries.</p>
                <p>The headquarters was established in Rome, because the parties, Israel and Egypt,
                    wanted it outside of the area, but close enough to the area so that there could
                    be contact. They didn't want the headquarters in either of their countries, and
                    there was nowhere else in the Middle East for them to reasonably do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The only other one might be Athens, and that was so
                        politically charged that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I'm not sure Athens was even approached. I can't recall if that was
                    considered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be very, very dubious.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: It certainly was looked at, but I doubt if the Greeks would have
                    wanted it. But the Italians did. And that was close enough to the Middle East to
                    do it, so the headquarters was set up there. The headquarters initially had
                    about 35 expatriate employees and another 25 Italian support staff.</p>
                <p>The field forces were then headed by a Norwegian General, now by a New Zealand
                    General. There are three infantry battalions, a couple of air units, various
                    logistical support units, and a group of about 25 observers, who are civilians,
                    who go out on missions.</p>
                <p>Their function is to certify that Egyptian troop levels in the Sinai are in
                    accordance with those limits negotiated in the peace treaty, and similarly on
                    the Israeli side of the border that their troop levels are within the limits
                    prescribed.</p>
                <p>It's the only long-term peacekeeping force that I know of that's been set up
                    outside the U.N. This initially had its disadvantages, because there are many
                    countries that only want to participate in something like this through a U.N.
                    structure.</p>
                <p>So it took some doing to persuade a number of countries to participate in this
                    sort of ad hoc group. But once that initial breakthrough was done... Countries
                    were also concerned about general Arab hostility to the peace treaty, and
                    fearful that somehow their relations with, say, Saudi Arabia might be damaged. I
                    think in the event there was no cause for that concern, and nobody has suffered
                    from their participation in the MFO.</p>
                <p>So it has worked very well now since '82 when it was introduced in the Sinai.
                    From eight years later, I think it is well-respected by both the Israelis and
                    the Egyptians. It performs its functions quite efficiently, I think.</p>
                <p>During my tenure there we trimmed back the size of the force a little bit. Went
                    down from 2,700 to 2.400. Reduced the budgetary expenditures on this effort. Got
                    the Japanese to make a million-dollar-a-year contribution to our budget. So I
                    think some good things happened.</p>
                <p>People always ask me: “Is this necessary? Here they've been at peace for ten
                    years. Ten years ago they signed the treaty. Why do you have a peacekeeping
                    force there?”</p>
                <p>And my answer is, “I think it will be necessary probably until there is a broader
                    peace in the area, a general peace.”</p>
                <p>The Israelis will never feel so secure that they would be willing to give up a
                    peacekeeping force, until there is a general settlement with their Arab
                    neighbors, because lurking in the backs of their minds is a fear that Egypt
                    might somehow stray from the peace treaty.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, and a very important part of the agreement between Egypt and
                    Israel is that the present peacekeeping forces cannot be withdrawn without
                    mutual consent of both Israel and Egypt. It's very important to the Israelis
                    that there not be a repetition of that withdrawal at a critical moment.</p>
                <p>So I think the MFO provides assurance to both sides that the other is not working
                    up to some kind of a military strike. We believe that's important.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: No, it really goes quite smoothly. And the reason it goes smoothly is
                    that both Egypt and Israel really are, at this stage anyway, fully committed to
                    a peace between them.</p>
                <p>Now, that said, their relationship is not always of the greatest. The nature of
                    their dialogue isn't always as good as one might hope. So there is a need for
                    something like the MFO, or some form of peacekeeping, that can keep both sides
                    reassured that nothing untoward is happening in their relationship, at least in
                    the security side.</p>

                    into a kind of deep freeze, and they were barely speaking to each other. But the
                    MFO, and the system of liaison between the MFO and the two governments, has, in
                    difficult times like that, provided a kind of bridge and a way for a dialogue to
                    take place that might not otherwise have happened. So I think it's useful, what
                    goes on there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you would go out and talk... What was your
                        impression of the Egyptian's and the Israeli's military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: You mean their participation in the MFO as it started out, and their
                    attitudes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their attitudes and, also, as an outside observer, what
                        did you think about how they operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: The Egyptians, like so many Third World countries, have a lot of
                    problems. They have a good officer corps, I think, but they've got big budget
                    problems. They're poor, and their soldiers are poor, and they simply don't look
                    as sharp sometimes as other soldiers. And their equipment isn't as good. And
                    their living quarters aren't as good. But they're a large, professional
                    army.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the border you have a professional army, but it's highly
                    supplemented by what I would call almost a civilian army — people who are
                    drafted for a couple of years, come in and out, and then they're in the
                    reserves, and then the reserves are called up for training exercises, and so on.
                    So a big part of what the Israelis count as their military force is, most of the
                    time, civilian. That's quite a striking difference between the two armies.</p>
                <p>And then Israel is like a European country in terms of the level of development,
                    as opposed to Egypt, which really is a Third World country. And you see this
                    reflected in the military in the quality of equipment, quality of housing and
                    uniforms, and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's in it for, say, the Norwegians or other groups that
                        are there? How do they, the people who are there...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: There are, I would say, two groups. There's one group that's there
                    sort of for the money, if I may say so: the Fijians, the Colombians, and the
                    Uruguayans. I think they liked the prestige of it, also, of being involved in
                    something that's important and useful. But we paid them on a basis that was
                    useful to them, particularly the Fijians and perhaps the Colombians. The
                    Uruguayan unit was so small that the money probably didn't make much difference.
                    But the Fijians had a whole battalion there, and so did the Colombians, and we
                    were paying the so-called U.N. rate, roughly ten-dollars-a-day per soldier. So
                    this was an important foreign exchange earner.</p>
                <p>For other developed countries that participated, like Canadians and British and
                    French and so on, I think their motives were mixed. They are interested in the
                    area and in stability in the Middle East. But they have another motive, in some
                    instances anyway, the experience that their military gets in a different area,
                    in the Sinai, in the Middle East, a different kind of training experience that's
                    useful for them.</p>
                <p>Now we paid them on a totally different basis, the so-called incremental cost
                    formula. We paid them over and above what it would cost them to maintain those
                    troops in their home country, which was quite different from what we were paying
                    the Fijians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the American troops react to this type of
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I should say that this was quite a departure for American troops. We
                    had not participated, certainly not with troop units, in peacekeeping forces
                    under the U.N. We did have some observers in some different peacekeeping
                    operations. At least not for a long, long time we hadn't. There had been kind of
                    an unwritten rule that neither the Soviets nor the US would involve
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>But in order to get this one off the ground, and also the parties both wanted an
                    American presence in the peacekeeping force, this introduced US troops into the
                    Middle East context.</p>
                <p>We had a little trouble with this at the beginning. There were those who charged
                    that a US battalion in the Sinai was part of the American forward posturing,
                    forward positioning, in the Middle East, and somehow was part of CENTCOM, and
                    was a strike force to act in the Saudi peninsula, and so on. The Egyptians, for
                    obvious reasons, were very sensitive to that kind of a charge. So we had to take
                    a number of steps to keep that unit isolated from any other involvement with US
                    policy or US interests elsewhere in the area.</p>
                <p>That was sometimes easier said than done. There were some Generals back at the
                    Pentagon who couldn't stop licking their chops. But, operationally, we had them
                    very much under our direction, and they were not available for other activities
                    or even under contingency planning.</p>
                <p>On the staff level, the Americans loved it, loved being there. The US Army, as an
                    institution, liked having the battalion out there. And it was rotated every six
                    months. At first, there were just two divisions that were sending battalions
                    out. That has now been expanded to four different divisions, so the experience
                    has spread around more.</p>
                <p>But they consider it a tremendous training experience. Just logistically, to
                    actually pick up a battalion and deploy it 6,000 miles away or 8,000 miles away,
                    is a tremendous experience. Then being able to train in a desert environment
                    they found useful.</p>
                <p>The down side for them was they were there as a peacekeeping unit. The mission is
                    quite different from fighting wars. I think some of the units have found it a
                    little difficult to change gears that way and remember going out...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which way do we point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes. Talking to some of the American soldiers one time, I just asked
                    one of these paratroopers, “Soldier, why are you here?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I'm here to fight terrorists, sir!”</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, I think we may need a little work on the mission here.”</p>
                <p>The biggest problem with all of the battalions is boredom, trying to keep them
                    interested and keep them going through their training paces and everything.
                    They're sitting out on these little outposts, ten people out on an outpost, for
                    a couple of weeks at a stretch, and they get bored. They just get bored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Peter, you left then in 1988?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: Yes, June of '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the last question I try to ask of everybody: If a
                        young man or a young woman comes up to you and says, “What about the Foreign
                        Service as a career?” how do you respond to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CONSTABLE: I find this more and more difficult, frankly, on two counts. One, is I
                    don't think I like what I hear is happening in the Foreign Service now on the
                    sort of politicization of the process, and attitudes, which I think have gone on
                    now through three or four administrations, of a kind of denigration of the value
                    of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>But certainly up until the time I left, I still felt that there were some
                    wonderful careers to be had in the Foreign Service, and you could do some
                    marvelous things. You could end up in positions where you had a genuine and
                    major impact on policy. And that's probably still true today.</p>
                <p>From a more personal side, it seems to me it's tougher and tougher to reconcile
                    family requirements and the Foreign Service. It's less and less common now for
                    women not to want a career, or spouses to want their own careers. I don't think
                    it gets any easier to try to pursue those careers overseas in remote places.</p>
                <p>I used to tell my sons and my daughter that if they were ever interested in the
                    Foreign Service they'd better marry a teacher or a doctor or a nurse, people who
                    could carry a career with them wherever they went. None of them has chosen to go
                    into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>But that's the toughest part, and I don't see how young people do this now. My
                    wife is also in the Foreign Service, but we did most of our child-raising years
                    when she was out of the Foreign Service. She had been forced out, because we got
                    married, and then they changed the ground rules and invited spouses to come
                    back, who had been forced out for reasons of matrimony or childbearing. So she
                    did come back, but by the time she came back, and then we were here in
                    Washington through a good part of that, so most of our children got grown up
                    before we had to do a split, be in different places. And I just wonder how these
                    young people try to do split assignments and keep a marriage going.</p>
