                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give me a little of your background
                        before we get into the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I was born and brought up in the New York City metropolitan area, both
                    in Manhattan and in the suburbs in Westchester County.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you educated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I went to a private day school as a youngster, both in Westchester
                    County and in New York City, briefly, and then I had five years at a preparatory
                    school in Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which one was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Saint Marks School, Southborough, Massachusetts. Then went on from there
                    to Yale, graduating in '41.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a good year to graduate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes. Unlike most of my classmates, I didn't go immediately into the
                    military. I took the last pre-war Foreign Service exams, which were given in
                    September of '41, having studied through the summer at a tutoring school
                    together with old friends like Marshall Green and others. Anyway, I passed both
                    the written and the orals, which were given shortly after Christmas that year,
                    having had a deferment from my draft board. Then after I passed, as was the
                    custom in those days, the State Department requested my deferment, so that I
                    entered the Foreign Service in March of '42.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What led you to this interest in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, over the years as a youngster I'd always been interested in the
                    idea of public service of some sort, and my primary interest lay in the field of
                    foreign affairs, which increased during my college years. At one time I was torn
                    as to whether to go into business or law, and then perhaps enter the field of
                    foreign affairs as an appointee later on, but I decided against that. That's
                    really essentially it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you entered, did you get any training before you went
                        off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, I didn't. Of course, ideally I would have preferred, if it hadn't
                    been for the outbreak of war, to have done some graduate studies at Fletcher,
                    Stanford, someplace like that, or even in Paris. But that wasn't feasible, so
                    that I went immediately into the service in March of '42.</p>
                <p>No, in those days you did not have any preliminary service. The system was that
                    you were sent out immediately to a post. Most frequently in those days it was
                    either to a Canadian border post or to a Latin American post fairly close by.
                    And then after a year's service you were brought back to the department to go
                    through what they call the Foreign Service training school. Since I didn't have
                    it, I've gotten from hearsay that it was a period of about three or four months
                    in which they put you through some of the ropes, building on your experience in
                    that first year. Because of the war, that system was dropped, so I never had
                    that schooling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sent to Cuba in '42?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, Havana, Cuba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you served there for about two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: A little over two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you serving and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I was initially posted to Havana, the capital. For a year, during the
                    two years I was there, I was put in charge of a one-man listening post at a
                    place called the Isle of Pines. I'll get to that later.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In Havana, it was primarily a training experience. There were quite a few other
                    younger officers there at that time—Bob McBride, who has since died, I'm afraid,
                    and Bill Crawford was there and others. They rotated us around. Did work in the
                    economic and commercial section, writing up the traditional reports on business
                    opportunities and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Then quite a bit of time in the consular section, which was quite busy at that
                    time. Because of the war, there were a large number of European refugees, who
                    couldn't get directly into the United States from Europe, who made Cuba their
                    transitional stopping place. They applied for American visas there, which made
                    that section fairly busy and active. And then, it being wartime, there was a
                    certain amount of economic warfare work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what economic warfare work was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, as I recall it, I was not in it very long, but the basic outlines
                    are very simple. We were trying to deny the flow of certain products to the Axis
                    powers. And that involved, wherever one might be stationed, working with the
                    local government to try and prevent business contacts and commercial contacts
                    involving the shipment of scarce materials, metals and that type of thing to the
                    Axis powers.</p>
                <p>Cuba was not a particularly difficult post in that regard, in that in those days
                    Cuba was really an economic colony of the United States. It was overwhelmingly
                    dominated by the United States' financial and industrial interests, so that we
                    never had much trouble persuading the Cubans to cooperate with us. I think we
                    may have had more problems elsewhere in Latin America, where the Germans were a
                    little more firmly entrenched, but in Cuba that wasn't a major problem. Spain
                    was another example, being a neutral country, which was extremely important in
                    that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you say you were a one-man post on the Isle of
                        Pines. I'm always interested in some of these wartime experiences, because
                        the Foreign Service is doing odd things in places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes. Well, it's one of those things that is done in wartime that in
                    retrospect seemed rather unnecessary and unimportant. But I guess in the heat of
                    war, precautionary steps are taken that seemed advisable at the time. I think
                    the reason was that there were a number of Axis nationals— Germans, Japanese,
                    some Italians—who lived in Cuba when war broke out in December of '41. The
                    Cubans, at our request, locked them all up, and they happened to put them in a
                    federal penitentiary which was located on the Isle of Pines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is now notorious under Castro, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: Right. The Isle of Pines is now known as the Isle of Youth, if I'm not
                    mistaken. The penitentiary was a modern, up-to-date facility that had been built
                    by a fairly enterprising Cuban military man a few years before, for other
                    reasons. But in terms of penal institutions, it was modern and clean, well run.
                    But in addition to that, there were a few Japanese farmers throughout Cuba, and
                    some perhaps on the Isle of Pines itself, and they also were locked up and put
                    in this penitentiary.</p>
                <p>The idea was that they just wanted somebody on the spot, to make sure that the
                    Cubans were doing what they were supposed to be doing in keeping these people
                    locked up and not engaging in any hanky- panky. I guess some of the Germans and
                    the Italians were fairly well heeled, and perhaps had money that they
                    conceivably could have used to get special privileges. In addition to that, in
                    the early days of the war, this was at the height of the submarine scare. There
                    were numerous reports of German submarines appearing, and they just wanted to
                    have somebody around to keep an eye on that particular area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in '42, '43, there were really tremendous
                        losses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Oh, very much. That was a bad spring, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess there's a book out right now called Operation
                        Drumroll isn't it, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, it was mostly further north along the eastern seaboard, but I guess
                    the Caribbean also had a certain amount, too.This brings up an amusing
                    anecdote.</p>
                <p>You asked me various things I did at the embassy at Havana. (I'm sorry I'm
                    getting a little out of order here.) It was only six months after I arrived in
                    Havana that they sent me over to the Isle of Pines, where I stayed for a year
                    and then came back to Havana and finished my tour. The reason they picked me to
                    go to the Isle of Pines was because the young vice consul from Canada, who was
                    coming down supposedly to do this, had already been in the service a year, and
                    for some reason or other they weren't very happy with his performance in Canada,
                    so they decided to keep him in Havana and send me down there.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>When I came back to Havana after the year on the Isle of Pines, one of the jobs I
                    did was to serve as the ambassador's sort of private secretary, scheduling
                    appointments and so forth. In that capacity, I sat in on some of the staff
                    meetings. One of them was attended by a very famous American who was a resident
                    in Cuba, Ernest Hemingway, who had a home there for many years and whom I got to
                    know reasonably well. You'll recall he was a great fisherman, and he had, I
                    guess for those days, a fairly big, expensive fishing craft that he used to go
                    out in. During the war, of course, gasoline fuel was rationed and it was very
                    difficult for the layman to get hold of. But anyway, one of the items addressed
                    in the staff meeting, which Ernest Hemingway sat in on, was to explain his
                    proposal. In return for getting fuel for his fishing boat, he would go out and
                    be a decoy to spot any possible submarine surfacings. This was taken very
                    seriously, and the embassy actually went along with it and gave him the fuel,
                    which I thought was a bit of a scam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In another interview that I had, one of our top Foreign
                        Service colleagues spent a good part of the war out in the Gulf Stream in a
                        sailing vessel, in the Navy, and they were just looking for submarines. They
                        just sailed back and forth—sailing because they could do it cheaper and they
                        didn't have to come in. And there they sat out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: We also had an airbase, Army airbase in those days, on the western tip
                    of Cuba, in what is called Pinar del R�o Province. I became quite friendly with
                    some of the officers at that base. Their primary mission was to go out on daily
                    reconnaissance flights, to keep an eye out for submarines and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems sitting on the Isle of Pines?
                        Sounds like you just went over and looked at the wall once a day and
                        then...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: It was very hard to keep myself busy; I think I did a lot of reading
                    that year. It was a very interesting little place. This is a historical
                    sidelight, but at the end of the Spanish-American War (for some reason that is a
                    little hazy in my memory now), there was some reason to believe that this little
                    island might be acquired by the United States.</p>
                <p>There was, for those days, a sizable flow of American farmers, mostly from the
                    upper Middle West, who went down there and started a citrus industry, growing
                    grapefruit primarily, also limes, and winter vegetables like cucumbers to supply
                    the American market. And it was a rather thriving little American community for
                    awhile.</p>
                <p>After awhile the bubble burst, in that the United States made it clear that they
                    were not planning to try to acquire the island. Most of the settlers went back,
                    but there remained a reasonably sizable little community of a hundred Americans
                    or so, with their families, engaged primarily in agriculture.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>It was like being in a typical midwestern agricultural area. Real
                    salt-of-the-earth Americans; it was wonderful. Of course, they didn't get along
                    terribly well with the Cubans, whom they regarded, with some merit, as a little
                    bit backward and corrupt and so forth. But they were, of course, delighted to
                    have an American official on hand, and I became good friends with many of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Havana. You enlisted in the Army
                        or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Not quite that. What happened was that in the early years of the war the
                    State Department requested the local draft boards to defer all its officers,
                    because it was a very small service in those days. I think we were 750 officers
                    or something like that. Because we were expanding the service during the war to
                    cope with new wartime demands, the department wanted to keep its officer corps.
                    But the political pressures grew on the White House over those years. And the
                    story was that, I think it was Judge Rosenman who was the counsel to Franklin
                    Roosevelt, apparently he eventually prevailed, I guess it was in 1944, on the
                    president or whoever made the decisions, to get the State Department to alter
                    that policy of requesting deferments. So a compromise was reached whereby the
                    department no longer requested the deferment of its younger officers, I think
                    ones who were under 30 years old and particularly if they were unmarried.</p>
                <p>There was also, from the Foreign Service point of view, a rather infamous
                    agitation in the local press, in the old Washington Times Herald that Cissy
                    Patterson published. At some point there, mid-1944, a whole page appeared in the
                    Times Herald, with the pictures of about two dozen Foreign Service officers. And
                    the headline said: “THESE FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS DO NOT CHOOSE TO FIGHT.” The
                    department was rather weak-kneed in its response to that.</p>
                <p>In any case, the upshot was that, although the department ceased to request the
                    deferment of quite a large number of officers, I think there were only about 30
                    or 40 that were actually drafted as a result of that—one of whom was myself.</p>
                <p>Most of us ended up gravitating into being selected for work either in the Army,
                    the Navy, or the Office of Strategic Services, which amounted to virtually what
                    we were doing in the Foreign Service except that we were doing it for much less
                    pay.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>So what happened was that I came back to Washington. I applied to the Navy at
                    ONI, but I was turned down for eyes, so I was inducted into the Army. Went
                    partially through basic training, near here at Fort Belvoir. And then in the
                    middle of that, I was pulled out by the Office of Strategic Services, which I
                    had also put in an application for. That must have been November or December of
                    1944. And then I spent the rest of my very brief and inglorious career in the
                    military with the Office of Strategic Services. Initially in Washington, and
                    then I was sent overseas to Cairo.</p>
                <p>I was attached to the African Bureau of what was called SI, Special Intelligence,
                    I think, or Secret Intelligence, in the Office of Strategic Services. I was sent
                    over as the number two man in the Cairo office of OSS, attached to but in a
                    separate building from our Embassy. By that time, Cairo was very unimportant...
                    everything had moved on to the Balkans and so forth.And then the last few months
                    I was there I was sent up to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where I think I had what
                    might be perhaps the unique experience of being a Foreign Service officer who
                    subsequently served as a Foreign Service clerk. I was assigned under cover as a
                    Foreign Service clerk in the embassy. That again was very uneventful. It was
                    interesting. I enjoyed seeing East Africa, and Ethiopia in particular, but I
                    didn't accomplish anything of any real value.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the service in '45?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, I was placed on military leave in the summer of '44 and then served
                    in the Army until the end of the war. As soon as the bombs dropped on Hiroshima
                    and the war ended in Japan, the State Department immediately asked the military
                    to release the people who had been drafted. There was a time lag involved in
                    getting back and demobilized and so forth. It was, I think, late November of '45
                    when I was demobilized from the Army and reported back to Washington.</p>
                <p>At that point, I again expressed my interest to Personnel in being assigned to
                    China. It was renewed interest, because I had done it earlier while I was in
                    Havana. I had kept in touch with the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs, particularly
                    the Office of Chinese Affairs, about my interest. And they were interested,
                    particularly after the war, in rebuilding their Chinese language officer
                    strength. So when I got back to Washington, I guess it was in January, they put
                    in a plug with Personnel to have me go into Chinese language training.</p>
                <p>It was not my original thought. I had thought I could be sent out to one of our
                    China posts. During the war in Havana, I had applied for such a posting and
                    actually been assigned to Chungking, but I never got there because Havana
                    wouldn't release me until my replacement came. By that time, I was in the
                    Army.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So, as a result of the intervention of the Office of Chinese Affairs, Personnel
                    agreed to post me to Yale University, where they were beginning to put officers
                    through what amounted to eight months of preliminary Chinese language training,
                    following which we went out to Peking, or Peiping as it was then known, for
                    another year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you then went to Peking from '47 to '48?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Let's see, yes. The better part of '46 was at Yale, and then I got out
                    to Peiping or Peking at the Beginning of '47. The language program training
                    lasted till mid- 1948. Had a couple of months just attached to the Consulate
                    staff there, and then was sent down to Southwest China to head up the Consulate
                    at Kunming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other Foreign Service officers taking
                        Chinese at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Oh, very much so, yes. As I said, they were rather depleted in their
                    Chinese language officer corps strength, so they were engaged in quite a program
                    of building that up. At Yale, while I was there, in the term or class before me,
                    there was Ed Martin (China Ed Martin, not the South American economic Ed
                    Martin). He and another fellow, Jim Spear, were already there. Spear
                    subsequently resigned. When I was there, there was a chap named Bob Rinden. We
                    were in the same group. We were soon followed by others including Doug Forman,
                    Al Jenkins, Ralph Clough, Oscar Armstrong, and Jerry Stryker group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give just a little feeling about
                        this. There's nothing like a group of relatively junior officers getting
                        together and studying a language. I mean, they look at the society to which
                        they're going and all. How did they feel? This was, of course, a tumultuous
                        time in China. How did you all, or you particularly, feel about the
                        Kuomintang, the Communist side, and Chinese society as a whole?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, that's a big question. Sure.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, that group of Chinese language officers (and we have remained very
                    close, because we tended to associate throughout our careers and still see a lot
                    of each other, at least those in the Washington area) came from different
                    sources. But a good many of them, well, certainly Oscar Armstrong was brought up
                    in China of an American missionary family. Both Ed Martin and Doug Forman were
                    of missionary families, although their families had been in India, not in China.
                    But Ed Martin's wife was of an American missionary family in China. I had, of
                    course, no previous contact at all with China except general interest. Ralph
                    Clough had been out there as an exchange student at Lingnan University. And then
                    some of the older language officers like Tony Freeman had also been at
                    Lingnan.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Well, to get back to your basic question. I think we all were very sympathetic to
                    China, through background or reading and so forth, and had read a lot about what
                    was going on there during the war. For instance, one of the books that was
                    current at the time was called Thunder Out of China by Theodore White and
                    Annalee Jacoby. It painted a rather disillusioning picture of what was going on
                    there, and so did most of the reports coming out of China. We also were, of
                    course, aware of the problems that some of the older Chinese language
                    specialists and Far East specialists had been facing. This was even before the
                    McCarthy accusations, but they were already under attack by people like
                    Ambassador Hurley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Patrick Hurley was a particularly vehement antagonist
                        towards the Foreign Service, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I never had any personal contact with him, so I couldn't comment on that
                    too accurately. But certainly, from what I've heard from older colleagues who
                    associated with him, they didn't regard him quite in the same sense as McCarthy.
                    I think they felt he just wasn't terribly bright, and also that he was rather
                    boastful and so forth, and sort of a loose cannon more than anything else. Many
                    people thought that Roosevelt sent him to China to get him out of the way. In
                    any case, after reading books like Barbara Tuchman's Stilwell and the American
                    Experience in China and other books of the same sort, Hurley doesn't come off
                    terribly well. Some of my friends certainly found him very difficult to work
                    with. But in any case, this colored our general approach.</p>
                <p>In addition to that, it wasn't too difficult for anybody with a reasonably open
                    mind, when once one arrived on the spot, to see that the situation was a very
                    difficult and unhealthy one. It wasn't so much that we were hostile to or
                    critical of the national government, the Kuomintang government. They faced
                    extraordinarily difficult problems. The war had weakened them badly. It forced
                    them into the interior, where they lost their foundation with western
                    middle-class roots and were forced back into the old China, depending on
                    warlordism and this sort of thing. Inflation was rampant, which again was not by
                    any means entirely their fault; it was just a wartime situation. The bottom line
                    to all this was that the regime was very obviously weak, it lacked control over
                    much of the country. There was the usual traditional Chinese corruption, both in
                    the military and in the civil government. The regime really lacked the ability
                    to do anything effective economically on behalf of either the middle class, to
                    which it really owed most of its support, or to the peasantry around the
                    country.</p>
                <p>And then, contrasted with this, you had the Communists under Mao Zedong who,
                    whatever their methods, seemed to have a real conviction and spirit, and to be,
                    at that time at least, fairly self-sacrificing in making efforts to do something
                    on behalf of the people and not merely being interested in enriching
                    themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So one couldn't help be rather skeptical of the claims of the national government
                    that it was reasserting its control, and also a little pessimistic as to how
                    things were going to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there, within the Foreign Service family while you
                        were in Peking, any what could be called a generational gap? I mean, the
                        younger officers coming in and saying this is a mess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This happens in some other places, but it didn't
                        happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, it was a generational gap, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't true in
                    Nanking. I didn't serve there, that was where the Embassy was. It most
                    definitely was not true in Peiping. When we first got there, the Consul General
                    was Tony Freeman, and then Tony went back to Washington. He was succeeded by
                    Oliver Edmund Clubb, who was certainly a generation older than us, but he very
                    definitely had the views of most of the Foreign Service specialists on China,
                    and as a result got into trouble himself.</p>
                <p>Actually, the only generational gap, in the sense that you were referring to,
                    that I ran into, was really later. The man involved I met in Washington
                    originally, and I was in a sense recruited by him, and then later he was my
                    Consul General in Hong Kong, and that's Everett Drumright, who was a very
                    staunch supporter of the Kuomintang and inclined to think that, whatever its
                    faults, we had to support it to the end. Perfectly good argument to be made for
                    that, but he was regarded by the other language officers as, I won't put it in
                    terms of right and left, because it really wasn't that, but certainly more
                    vigorously anti-Chinese Communist than the younger generation, and more inclined
                    to feel that it would be a tremendous mistake to allow them to take over the
                    country or, later on, to retain their control of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you finish your training and then what was your
                        first assignment? Where did you go and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, actually, as I said, there was a slight interlude there. I guess I
                    concluded my training around June of '48 and was temporarily detailed to work in
                    the Consulate for a couple of months. They were making arrangements for me to go
                    down to Kunming in the southwest to head up the Consulate there. But in terms of
                    the personnel shifts involved, it involved a brief delay. So I went down to
                    Kunming, I guess it was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kunming is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: Southwest China. It's the capital of the Province of Yunnan. The western
                    border of Yunnan abuts Burma, and it became very important during World War II,
                    because Kunming was the Chinese terminus of the Burma Road, also of the flights
                    over the Hump. They brought their supplies in to the American and Chinese forces
                    from India. So during the war it experienced quite a bit of development. It had
                    always traditionally been a bit of a backwater in China, controlled by warlords
                    and so forth. But during the war it spruced up quite a bit. Then after the war
                    it reverted a bit. Not to the extent before the war, but as soon as the war was
                    over, everything went back to Nanking and Shanghai. Incidentally, I might just
                    mention, during the war, of course, as you probably know, many of the Chinese
                    universities from the coastal areas were relocated, both in Yunnan and the other
                    province to the north, Szechuan, where Chungking is located.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? Why did we have a post there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Of course, we had a network of posts in China, pre-war. I can't give you
                    the exact number, but it must have been ten to fifteen, which were scattered all
                    around.</p>
                <p>Kunming (which in the old days was called Yunnan-fu, but Kunming's easier) was of
                    some strategic importance, because it was really in a sense part of a French
                    sphere of influence. They had a railroad coming up from Indochina to Kunming, so
                    the French were always fairly important there. The British were interested in it
                    also.</p>
                <p>Just as we had Consulates in Chungking, which was really a more important place
                    because it was on the Yangtze River, it was considered desirable to have a
                    Consulate in Kunming. I couldn't begin to tell you when it was first opened, but
                    certainly it must have been ever since the 1920s and possibly a little earlier.
                    There were certain American commercial interests there, but it wasn't a major
                    field of American commercial activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Primarily political reporting, because that was a very crucial period
                    there, '48 to '49, when things began to crumble. First in Manchuria, where,
                    incidentally, I had taken a language officer field trip in 1947. Got sort of
                    marooned up there, because of one of the Chinese Communist offensives. Had to
                    fly back to Peking since the rail line was cut. But, as I say, you had this
                    gradual crumbling of the Nationalist position, first in Manchuria, then in North
                    China. We left Peiping in October '48, and it fell to the Communists in
                    December, if I'm not mistaken. I think it was Tientsin first and then Peiping,
                    but I'm not positive. And then, of course, during most of '49 the Communists
                    were sweeping southward. There were some climactic battles north of the Yangtze
                    River, in the spring of '49, if I recall correctly. Then they took Nanking, and
                    the government evacuated to Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>We were, of course, uncertain which way things were going, so naturally we wanted
                    reporting from various parts of China. Canton was reporting on South China;
                    Kunming was reporting on Southwest China; Chungking, of course, on West China;
                    Hangzhou on the vital Yangtze basin. Those were the main Consulates at the time.
                    So primarily, really, it was political observation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your area in Southwest China? It was pretty far
                        removed from where the Red offensive was coming down. How were they reacting
                        as this went on, as far as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: After the end of World War II, the national government took the local
                    warlord to Nanking as a hostage in effect. But another local military man, a man
                    named Lu Han, became governor. He was more amenable to control by the central
                    government. There certainly were no overt or evident pro-Communist sympathies in
                    that area.</p>
                <p>To begin with, it was a political backwater. Nobody really thought that it would
                    ever play a vital role in the national picture but believed that it would really
                    be a reactor rather than an active participant. As I say, the local government,
                    headed by Governor Lu Han, plus whatever there was in the way of a
                    political-economic elite in Kunming and in Yunnan, very strongly favored the
                    central government against the Communists. But, of course, they weren't dumb;
                    they knew what was going on and were a little worried about what was going to
                    happen to them if the Communists succeeded in defeating the Nationalists and
                    taking over. And they also, of course, were uncertain as to what the attitude of
                    the United States would be.</p>
                <p>As you know, even pretty much at the end we were ploughing considerable military
                    aid and other aid into supporting the Nationalists, up until probably pretty
                    late in 1949, when the famous China White Paper appeared. As the situation
                    deteriorated in 1949, it was fairly obvious that the local people were going to
                    have to start thinking about what was going to happen there. The only organized
                    opposition to the central government and to the local government was in the form
                    of local banditry. There were no Communist units operating in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the endemic local banditry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Right, yes. They might call themselves Communists, but they really
                    weren't. I'm sure that it had never been established there was any contact
                    whatever between them and the main Chinese Communist command. But the roads were
                    a little unsafe to travel on over long distances, because you might be stopped
                    by some of these bandits. In fact, one of my vice consuls was stopped on a trip,
                    but all they wanted was medicine. And they always said that they had nothing
                    against the United States in any case.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>But, as I say, things deteriorated badly in the course of 1949. Nanking fell, and
                    the government evacuated to Taiwan. In territory unoccupied by the Communists,
                    that left three Consulates: Chungking in Szechuan; Kunming in the southwest; and
                    Canton down in the south. We, of course, still had our Consulates in
                    Communist-occupied areas, which weren't closed down until 1950.</p>
                <p>But the department in Washington was, in effect, engaged in some soul-searching
                    as to what the position should be with respect to Chungking and Kunming and
                    Canton. I think part of the Embassy relocated to Canton briefly before going on
                    to Taiwan. But for awhile, the decision was to hold on and keep those Consulates
                    open—Chungking, Kunming, and Canton—and await developments. Later on, I guess it
                    would have been somewhere around July or August...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, '49, because the Communists didn't complete their occupation of the
                    whole mainland until the end of '49. Later on, about July of '49, we got a
                    message from Washington advising that it would probably come down to closing
                    down the posts, and instructing us to start making preparations. One of the
                    steps ordered was to evacuate all dependents. My wife and two young children and
                    the vice consul's wife were sent out. I think that was early September of '49.
                    And then we were told to go on a standby basis and make all preparations so that
                    we could get out on short notice.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, elsewhere in China, the Communists were continuing to advance. And it
                    became clear that the local government in Yunnan would have to decide what they
                    were going to do. Whether they would turnover to the Communists or try to
                    maintain some sort of resistance.</p>
                <p>This was certainly classified at the time, but so much time has gone by I don't
                    think it could be considered classified now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure from that period that there is anything
                        classified.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I was approached by a leading local citizen, who obviously was speaking
                    on behalf of the local power structure, including the governor, asking if they
                    could count on American support if they tried to resist the Communists, and
                    whether we'd be willing to put in any military forces and so forth. The expected
                    reply came back that under no circumstances would we be prepared to do that. So
                    when they received that answer, obviously they had to start thinking in terms of
                    saving their own skins; I'm talking in retrospect here, because I had no
                    pipeline to what was going on. In consultations between myself and my British
                    and French colleagues, we all expected that some sort of deal would probably be
                    struck.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Arrangements were finally made to close up the Consulate early in December. I and
                    my vice consul were all set to fly out to Hong Kong. However, the day before our
                    scheduled departure local Yunnanese power structure staged a coup against what
                    remained of the rather limited national government force there. I guess it was
                    mostly Air Force. They took over the city and the airport. There was a lot of
                    firing going on, although I don't think there was much in the way of casualties.
                    The city was under martial law and the control of the local forces.</p>
                <p>I managed, through one of our local employees who had very good connections, to
                    get through to the governor, who assured us that we would be allowed to leave
                    safely. There were no commercial flights coming in any more, and we had to go
                    out on Claire Chennault's Civil Air Transport, CAT. They happened to have a
                    plane at the airport.</p>
                <p>So the following night we managed to make our way out to the airport, through
                    gunfire, and get out on the last flight out of Free China. It was rather
                    exciting, a lot of turmoil going on. It turned out to be after dark by the time
                    we actually boarded the plane.</p>
                <p>It was an old C-46, bucket seats and that sort of thing, and very heavily loaded
                    with machinery and whatnot. And I happened to notice something under the bucket
                    seat. There was a man there. He turned out to be one of a group of Chinese
                    Nationalist military personnel (I'm not sure whether it was Air Force or not),
                    trying to stow away aboard the plane to get out. Otherwise, they faced a very
                    uncertain prospect in Yunnan. They were bundled off the plane, the ones we could
                    find, and we finally took off.</p>
                <p>For those days, that was a very long runway, about 8,000 feet, built during the
                    war for the Hump run. But I thought we'd never get off it. We made it with only
                    a few feet to spare. It turned out we were very heavily loaded— more than we
                    realized. Because once we got airborne finally, more Chinese Nationalist
                    personnel, 20 maybe, came up from the baggage hold where they had stowed
                    themselves. All my baggage got lost; they must have thrown it out. Anyway, it
                    was rather an exciting exit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Kunming, did you feel any constraints on
                        your reporting? This was before the McCarthy era, but things were still
                        getting kind of... Were you just too far removed, or were you feeling any
                        pressures?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, I may have been naive, but I felt no constraints whatever. I wrote
                    exactly what I thought was going on. Actually, I continued to do so
                    subsequently, in Hong Kong, when I was in charge of the political section there.
                    I think the constraints were felt more by people in Washington than they were in
                    the field. At least that was my impression.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't feel that you were getting gunfire from
                        both sides, from Washington? There was no feeling of, well, here's a policy
                        that's going down the drain and we're being stuck with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, I didn't. There was no effort, certainly from Washington, to dictate
                    to us what we should be saying. And no complaints about what we were reporting
                    that I recall. Certainly at the receiving end at the working level, in
                    Washington, were people with much the same views. In any case, we weren't trying
                    to be tendentious or anything, we were just trying to report what we saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you got to Hong Kong when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: From Kunming?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, that was somewhere around December 10, 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then were you immediately reassigned? Did you go back
                        to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I went back to Washington, because I'd been away for three years and I
                    was due some home leave. The department very nicely actually let me take a
                    little local leave, to have a chance to go down to Bangkok and Angkor.</p>
                <p>After I got back to Washington, I was assigned on a temporary basis to the Office
                    of Chinese Affairs. Normally speaking, Chinese language officers, after leaving
                    their language training program, would have been assigned to various Consulates
                    all over China. But this wasn't possible any more, because we had by that time
                    severed relations.</p>
                <p>So we were scattered around the periphery, with a view to keeping an eye on China
                    from the perspective of the surrounding areas. As you know, there were very
                    important Overseas Chinese communities, particularly in Southeast Asia, and that
                    was also something we were supposed to be keeping an eye on and reporting. We
                    were scattered everywhere, from Seoul, Korea, to Japan, Manila, of course Hong
                    Kong and Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Burma, even India.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>And it so happened that it was decided that we were going to beef up our presence
                    in what was then called Malaya before it became Malaysia. One Chinese language
                    officer, Oscar Armstrong, was assigned to Singapore. And I was assigned to
                    reopen a post in Penang, Malaya, in northern Malaya near Thailand. So I went out
                    there in the summer of 1950, reopened the Consulate there, and served there for
                    two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Malaya was then still under British rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Right. It remained under British rule until 1957, when they gave
                    independence to Malaya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went with your family, I take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your main job while you were there from '50 to
                        '52? The Korean War broke out about that time. Relations were nasty. What
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I'd say it was 90 percent political reporting. A couple of years
                    earlier, around 1948, what they called, euphemistically, “The Emergency” had
                    broken out with the local Chinese Communists in Malaya. They were not connected
                    with the Chinese Communists on the mainland, but they were ethnic Chinese, part
                    of the very substantial Overseas Chinese minority in Malaya, who had their own
                    Communist Party. Actually, during the war they worked with the British against
                    the Japanese, during the Japanese occupation.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the war, they staged this uprising, killed a lot of British rubber
                    planters and people in the tin industry, and made life very difficult. The
                    British had quite a substantial military force there combating this emergency.
                    It was a difficult period. At one point, the British governor general was
                    assassinated on his way up to a weekend in one of the hill stations. And then
                    they sent out a really tough man, by name of Sir Gerald Templar, to head up the
                    thing and bring it under control. There were various efforts made by the army
                    and the police to cordon off the dispersed Chinese farmers, gather them together
                    in secure, guarded villages, and keep them from contact with the guerrillas in
                    the jungle. It was a long, hard process.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I'm no expert on Malaya, but in retrospect I think probably they were only able
                    to really get on top of this once they granted independence to Malaya in 1957,
                    and undercut the argument of the Chinese Communist guerrillas that the country
                    was a foreign colony and should be liberated. And the Malays who dominated the
                    country, both demographically and politically, certainly never had any love for
                    the Chinese, so that they were then also able to collaborate a bit more with the
                    British forces in bringing the thing finally under control. But it was a rather
                    tense period.</p>
                <p>Penang itself was not affected. It seemed to have been regarded as a rest area by
                    both sides. With the exception of one or two assassinations of some rather
                    staunch anti- Communist Chinese newspaper and academic people there, there
                    really were no incidents on the island itself.</p>
                <p>My area included the whole of northern Malaya. At that time, we had no embassy,
                    of course. The main office, the Consulate General, was in Singapore. And we had
                    two consulates: one in Kuala Lumpur, which is now the capital, and in Penang.
                    Both Kuala Lumpur and Penang had rather fairly loose supervision from Singapore.
                    So, from the point of view of a junior officer, it was an ideal situation. We
                    had a big and interesting territory to travel around and report on, and only
                    rather tenuous control from Singapore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It varied from place to place, but here, this was
                        obviously an emerging situation, with the emergency on and all. Were you
                        constrained because of British rule so that you couldn't talk to the other
                        elements, particularly the Chinese or the Malays, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Not at all, no, no. I think they (the British) kept an eye on and knew
                    what we were doing, but in fact they encouraged me. Having just come from
                    language school, I was eager to try to continue my Chinese (although the Chinese
                    spoken there was not what I had learned in Peking). So I did have contact, to a
                    certain extent, with some of the Chinese leaders, who were really not very
                    political. It was a commercial class. But I made one or two speeches in Chinese
                    at some of the Chinese schools in Penang. The resident commissioner, a
                    Britisher, congratulated me on it, even felt delighted because I was taking an
                    anti-Communist line. They obviously knew what I was doing. I made it a point, of
                    course, of working very closely with the British, obviously, because they knew
                    far more about what was going on there than I could ever hope to know.</p>
                <p>Penang happened to have been a place where the population was predominantly
                    Chinese with almost no Malays. There were only a few Indians. The rest of the
                    area, however, the provinces on the mainland like Perak and Kelantan, were the
                    two main ones that I had supervision over. And I made a point of traveling to
                    them and meeting the Malay officials nominally in charge, although the British
                    still held the reins of power. I had to work with them, too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you beginning to feel any of the heat from attacks on
                        our China policy, because you'd been associated, or on your reporting? I'm
                        talking about McCarthyism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, none whatever. Never that I experienced. I was too junior, for one
                    thing, and not in a very controversial area, for another. But I was certainly
                    reporting freely and as honestly as I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the situation there? What was the thrust
                        of your reporting? That the British were eventually going to get out, or
                        that they could keep it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I think I would have been presumptuous to have tried to comment on that.
                    The main focus of British rule was in Kuala Lumpur, where my colleague, Hank Van
                    Oss, was doing that to the extent that he could, plus Singapore. No, my main
                    thrust was just interviewing and seeing the people who were in present control,
                    the British, plus some of the leading Malays who promised to be leaders in the
                    future.</p>
                <p>It was impossible, at the height of the emergency, to predict when, if ever, the
                    British were going to grant independence. I know many of the British certainly
                    were resisting this idea—the usual idea that the Malays couldn't stand on their
                    own, and that if they left the country, the Malays and the Chinese would be at
                    each other's throats.</p>
                <p>I had no vision that the thing was going to happen quite so quickly as it did. In
                    fact, when I left there in '52, I was rather pessimistic, frankly, as to how
                    things were going to develop. I felt fairly sure they would get on top of the
                    insurgent problem, but I was pessimistic as to the future of Malaya in terms of
                    the difficulty of the Chinese and the Malays getting along together.</p>
                <p>There had been, of course, a long history of problems there, with the Chinese
                    dominating the industry and commerce to the extent that the British didn't, and
                    the Malays being rooted to the land and having some of the old traditional power
                    of the Malay rulers, plus a favored position in the British local
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>The Malays were very fortunate in getting a man as their first prime minister,
                    Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was on good terms with the Chinese, and who was
                    enlightened enough to realize that it was important for the two communities to
                    work together. So that even if the Malays have dominated the situation
                    politically and militarily since independence, the Chinese have been willing to
                    go along.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Interestingly, I think I was one of the first official Americans to meet Tunku
                    Abdul Rahman, who came from the royal family of the State of Kedah, which is
                    near Penang. I think I may have been one of the first American officials to
                    entertain him after he was elected as head of this fairly new organization
                    called the United Malay National Organization. Most people regarded him as a bit
                    of a lightweight and a figurehead, but he certainly turned out very well in the
                    final analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Penang in 1952, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Before I go from Penang, there is an anecdote that I think is amusing. I
                    don't know if it's any earthshaking revelation or not, but anyway.</p>
                <p>In the course of one of the trips that I took around my consular district, I
                    stopped off in Kuala Lumpur for a night or two, staying with my colleague, Hank
                    Van Oss, who was the consul there. And it so happened that at that particular
                    juncture there was a visiting congressional group, consisting of then
                    Representative John F. Kennedy, his brother, Robert, who had just gotten out of
                    Virginia law school, and one of his sisters, I don't remember which. They were
                    invited to dinner by Hank Van Oss. I was staying with him, so I was there, too,
                    and one of other members of Hank Van Oss's staff. His wife was in the hospital
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>It turned out to be a rather lively evening, because then Representative Kennedy
                    (who was in Malaya after a trip that had started in England, I think, and came
                    all the way around by way of India and various other places) was rather
                    critical. He thought, if I recall correctly, that the only place that was doing
                    reasonably well, among the places he had visited, was India. He had a very
                    isolationist bent to his remarks. It reminded me very much of his father, Joseph
                    Kennedy, during his years in London. So I got my hackles up arguing against
                    it.</p>
                <p>On the subject of Malaya, he thought we were paying too much for Malayan tin and
                    rubber. He thought that they were ripping off the United States on this. And my
                    argument was that it was better to let countries like this earn their way by
                    trade, rather than have to be impoverished and then have to receive aid from us.
                    He didn't care much for that line either.</p>
                <p>But anyway, during dinner Hank Van Oss and I were arguing against him in certain
                    respects. At some point during the dinner, he drew himself up short and said to
                    Hank and me, “Well, it's obvious I have nothing further to learn from you.” The
                    rest of the dinner was rather chilly.</p>
                <p>When he got down to Singapore (I'm told by my friends, including Oscar Armstrong
                    who was there), he apparently complained about our attitude.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>It was the year after that, in '52, that he was elected to the Senate. I was
                    amazed to find out that he, all of a sudden, had become an internationalist, not
                    an isolationist at all. I like to think that possibly something that we said
                    might have influenced him, but I guess he found much more important reasons for
                    changing his views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He probably read the political winds a little bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: And then, a very amusing follow up. It was when I was in the Senior
                    Seminar, in '61-'62. At the very end of the session, as frequently happened in
                    those days (I'm not sure whether it still does), we had a meeting with the
                    President in the Rose Garden. As we were introduced to him, Kennedy said,
                    “Lutkins, we've met before, haven't we?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, sir, at Kuala Lumpur.”</p>
                <p>And then he said, “And where is Van Oss now?”</p>
                <p>He obviously had been briefed. But to the best of my knowledge he never held the
                    episode against me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Penang in '52. I have you in Tokyo for a
                        relatively short tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: That's right, not quite two years. I think I was the first of the
                    Chinese language officers assigned to Tokyo. It was considered important that we
                    have somebody to liaise with the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding their
                    policy toward China, and our policy toward China, and also to keep aware of what
                    was going on in Japan regarding views about China, both in the business world
                    and in the academic world, press comments and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things were pretty Cold-warish, weren't they, at that
                        time? We had been fighting the Chinese in Korea, and the Japanese were
                        profiting very much. But very much with us at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I'm not sure they were really even profiting very much, because this was
                    just after the occupation. I got there at the end of '52. The occupation had
                    only been over for about six months, if I remember correctly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there for a very short time in the Air Force as an
                        enlisted man. I occupied the country for about three weeks, and then I was
                        defending the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: But even though the occupation was ended, the Japanese were still very
                    much under, I won't say control, but certainly they were strongly inclined to
                    defer to any views that we had in the field of military and foreign policy. And
                    as regards profiting from the Korean War, I'm no economic expert, but the
                    Japanese economy was still very much in the doldrums. They hadn't really started
                    anywhere near the process of takeoff. Now they may have been producing and
                    supplying some material for us in Korea. I just don't know the details on
                    that.</p>
                <p>As the job evolved during that year and half or two years that I was there the
                    focus of it broadened, so that I was following Japanese relations with Southeast
                    Asia, not Korea, but Southeast Asia. That was it primarily, what their attitude
                    was toward Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Japanese following things, or were they being
                        rather passive at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, they were beginning to emerge. They were certainly primarily
                    passive, but they were beginning to show some initiatives. And they certainly
                    had people on the ground who were following developments and reporting back to
                    Tokyo, so it was interesting to find out what the Japanese view was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the embassy at that point? Did you find
                        it a well-plugged-in embassy? I think John Allison was the ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Bob Murphy was ambassador for about six months after I arrived, and then
                    after that, John Allison. What do you mean by plugged in?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, that you had been in a relatively isolated
                        post, and all of a sudden here you were with your first really large
                        embassy. What was your impression of how it operated and the spirit of the
                        embassy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, it was a very chastening experience, going from being in charge of
                    two posts, with a lot of latitude. But, no, the adjustment was very easy, and it
                    was a very high-class, high-grade, high-powered bunch of people at most
                    levels.</p>
                <p>Certainly in the political section we had outstanding people. The first section
                    head was John Steeves, succeeded by Sam Burger. And then some of my colleagues
                    were Bill Leonhart, Bob Blake. I'm trying to think of some of the others. Dick
                    Lamb, Bill Sherman, who went on to a fine career in Japanese affairs, Dick Finn,
                    Dick Sneider. So we had a very excellent group in the political section. And I
                    think the economic section was equally strongly staffed, although I didn't have
                    as much contact with that.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I really wasn't close to Bob Murphy. He was obviously one of our eminent
                    ambassadors. I don't think he played probably quite as strong a role in Japan as
                    he may have in some of his other posts. John Allison was a Japanese language
                    officer and had a fine background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Hong Kong, is that right? This was when
                        and what were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: This was in 1954, and it was late summer, early fall. I must have
                    arrived in Hong Kong probably September, '54, and I was assigned to Hong Kong as
                    chief of the political division, replacing Ralph Clough, who was going back to
                    Washington to serve as the deputy director of the Office of Chinese Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: When I arrived, it was Julian Harrington, but he was transferred after a
                    period of three of four months. And he was succeeded by Everett Drumright, who
                    was a career Chinese language specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we have an interview with Everett Drumright. What
                        were you doing? What was the political section doing? After all, it was a
                        large political section. What were your goals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, it was summed up under the term of “China-watching” and continued
                    up until the time when the United States resumed relations with the People's
                    Republic of China in the early 1970s. Hong Kong was the place where
                    China-watching occurred and where all the China-watchers gathered. Whether they
                    were governmental, in terms of the Foreign Services of the different countries,
                    or whether it was academic, or the various press and media, that was the place
                    to be to try to follow what was going on, interpret what was going on inside
                    China.</p>
                <p>But interestingly enough, even with governments like the British and the Dutch,
                    Australians, I'm not sure about the Australians, but I know the Dutch, who like
                    the British, had relations with the Chinese Communists and an office in Peking.
                    But even in their cases, they thought it was helpful to have a specialist
                    stationed in Hong Kong. Since their people in Peking were circumscribed in their
                    movements, they felt it was useful to have somebody outside who could see the
                    picture from there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you talk about seeing the picture. I mean, after
                        all, the refugees were mostly from one area around Canton, I would
                        imagine.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: That wasn't entirely true. It's true that, if you're talking about the
                    overall influx of refugees, they were very much of a lower class, usually
                    peasants, small business and that sort of thing, who came in almost exclusively
                    from the area adjoining Hong Kong, the Province of Guangdong. But certainly when
                    I was there, in the '50s, you still had a trickle of other people coming out:
                    American and other missionaries who had been detained after the takeover of the
                    Chinese Communists who were being released from time to time; certain foreign
                    businessmen who were operating there, not Americans but other businessmen who
                    were operating in China, British and others who came out; and newspapermen from
                    other countries who were allowed to travel there, European and otherwise. So
                    that there was a small but constant flow of interesting potential sources of
                    information who were coming through Hong Kong and who were eagerly grabbed on by
                    the few people who wanted to talk to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other sources did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: The Chinese press, of course, was a major source. We had organized, even
                    before I got there, and further developed while I was there, a very substantial
                    operation translating the China mainland press. Some of it was readily
                    available, other publications that we obtained by a clandestine procurement
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a joint translation service with the
                        British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, no, it was entirely American. The British, and others, found it very
                    useful, but they had nothing to do with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised, because we had a joint translation service
                        in Belgrade and, I think, in Poland, where we did it together. But there was
                        no effort made to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, it was entirely American and a very large-scale affair. Among others
                    who were in charge of it for awhile, Oscar Armstrong, whom you may or may not
                    have talked to. I'm trying to remember how many people, we might have had twenty
                    or thirty Chinese local employees who were engaged in this, under our
                    supervision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why would the press be useful? I mean, supposedly
                        this was a tightly controlled regime where everybody was spouting the party
                        line and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: That is true, but you mentioned Eastern Europe and having contact with
                    the Soviet Union, I believe there was a great deal of similar work done in
                    trying to read fine nuances into what was being said in the press and if one
                    paper differed slightly from another. Of course, you had the major organs
                    controlled by the Chinese Party, but then you had one by the military, and then
                    you had, theoretically, a youth paper and so forth, and you could pick up
                    interesting little tidbits. And, in any case, we were relying on it not only for
                    major trends but for factual information as to what the regime itself was saying
                    in terms of statistical information on production and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>And then it was also extremely important when they were engaged in one of their
                    major campaigns, such as one that occurred while I was there called “Let The
                    Hundred Flowers Bloom,” which lasted for awhile, and then the “Great Leap
                    Forward,” which also occurred during the mid-'50s. I sometimes have a hard time
                    distinguishing the exact times, because I went on to work in the Office of
                    Chinese Affairs in Washington where we were the recipient of a lot of this
                    product. We used the Chinese press as a source of information in both cases, as
                    a basic source to be analyzed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, here you were, and you had been dealing more or less
                        with Chinese affairs, and you were really right at the center of where we
                        were looking at it. I mean, it was the closest thing we had to an embassy in
                        mainland China, really, at that time. How did you see China? Where were they
                        going? How was the thing working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, that's a very good question. I haven't gone back to review the
                    reports that I wrote during that period, and I wrote a good many. Of course, in
                    addition to our Chinese press translation program, we had the small corps of
                    Chinese language officers and others, including one Soviet specialist, who was
                    sort of on loan. We were doing quite a bit of varied reporting on developments
                    in certain different fields in China. But as the head of the political section,
                    I did the overview reports that we had to submit every three or four months,
                    plus the contributions to the WEEKA and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>As I saw it at that time, and as I reported it (and this ran against certainly
                    the wishes or the wishful thinking of certain people back in Washington, and
                    even to that of our Consul General, Mr. Drumright, who wanted to really believe
                    that the Chinese Communist regime was only a temporary aberration, a temporary
                    phenomenon and that it wouldn't last) it seemed to me definitely that the new
                    government had entrenched itself pretty securely. That by and large it governed
                    with the support of the mass of the people. That it had brought some
                    improvements, which were not necessarily due to Communism but to the mere fact
                    that it did exercise authority over the whole country for the first time in
                    fifty years or more, and therefore was in the position to take purposeful action
                    in terms of preventing famine, in getting supplies from one area of the country
                    to the other, in getting production back in shape after a period of the war
                    years in which everything was disrupted. In other words, it seemed to be a
                    fairly stable government.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>And, what was possibly more important, the people in charge of the government
                    showed no signs whatever of either disunity or lack of confidence in their
                    ability to govern. This all pointed to the fact that they were there to stay for
                    the foreseeable future. We couldn't look ahead to the 1980s, but at that point
                    it seemed to be a fairly stable, secure government enjoying popular support. And
                    we reported that, as such, to Washington. I guess, of course, in Washington we
                    were still trying to deny that picture and to work for the undermining and
                    downfall of the Communist regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk a little about... I sound like I'm harping
                        on the McCarthyism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, no, no, that's very important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's more than the McCarthyism. But you were a reporter
                        during the period. Dulles was in command. Walter Robertson was a key
                        figure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, we can get to that when I get to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Hong Kong, you had a man who had very
                        fixed ideas about whither we should be going, as Consul General. How did you
                        operate? What sort of pressures were on your reporting? How did you feel
                        working in this atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: By and large, completely free. There were only minimal constraints. And,
                    although I disagreed with Mr. Drumright on his basic outlook, to his credit he
                    never tried to tell us that we should report differently. He may have reported
                    under separate channels himself. If so, I wasn't aware of it. I don't, frankly,
                    think he did.</p>
                <p>I remember one rather amusing little thing that involves a Chinese nuance between
                    the two names for the Chinese city: one, being Peking and the other, Peiping.
                    Traditionally it was Peking, which means, in Chinese, “Northern Capital.” And
                    during the Nationalist days, in the late '20s and '30s, when they moved the
                    capital down to Nanking, which means “Southern Capital,” Peking became Peiping,
                    because they couldn't have two capitals, so it was “Northern Peace,”
                    Peiping.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>It was a corollary of our support of the Nationalist government, even after they
                    moved to Taiwan, that when the Chinese Communists took over and restored the
                    name of Peking, we refused to call it Peking. We called it Peiping. I thought
                    this was a little silly, so when I got posted to Hong Kong, in charge of the
                    reporting there, I started calling it Peking in our telegrams, which Mr.
                    Harrington didn't object to. Washington didn't object to it. But as soon as Mr.
                    Drumright got here, he said, “In Washington, we call it Peiping, not Peking.” So
                    we had to go back to the old method. As I said, it's not important at all, but
                    it shows the Washington mind set at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any private letters or visitors coming
                        through, saying Come on, fellas, get on the team, you've got to take more of
                        a line that this is a regime on the verge of tottering, or something like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, absolutely not. I'm not aware of anything along those lines
                    whatever. You might want to ask Ralph Clough, if you haven't already, whether he
                    did, because he was there for a year or two, in charge of the political section,
                    before I was. But I'm 100 percent confident that there was never anything done
                    like that.</p>
                <p>There was one other thing involving policy, a very minor one which I was
                    reminiscing with Arthur Hummel about recently. When I went there first, in 1954,
                    he was in charge of USIS in Hong Kong. That was before he shifted over to the
                    Foreign Service proper. It would have been at the end of '54 or early '55, when
                    they were going to have a conference down in Indonesia, I think it was the
                    Bandung Conference.</p>
                <p>I think it was our own initiative. We felt that it would be desirable to give
                    Washington the benefit of our views on what our attitude and position should be
                    at this conference, particularly because we knew that Chinese Communists were
                    going to be involved there. Art and I, I guess in a staff meeting, suggested
                    that we send out a joint message from the Consulate General giving our views.
                    And Everett Drumright nixed the idea.</p>
                <p>But there are more ways than one to skin a cat, so Art Hummel, through his own
                    channels, went back to Washington and had them send out a message requesting
                    that we should send them a telegram with our views. So we were able to get one
                    in to Washington as desired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, how did you, and maybe the people around
                        you, view the China-Soviet bloc?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Very interesting. Good question. I think the answer is that we very much
                    (probably unwisely as it turned out) saw it as a monolith at that particular
                    point.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I guess we should have been alert. Maybe it was because not enough of us had been
                    steeped in Chinese studies and Chinese history to remember that there had been
                    very long-lasting and bitter relations between China and Russia that predated
                    Communism, and that the Chinese resented the Russians taking over territory that
                    they regarded as Chinese and that were, in fact, I guess, subject to Chinese
                    suzerainty.</p>
                <p>But, as I say, at that particular point, probably because of the Korean War and
                    pressures on Vietnam and whatnot, we definitely regarded the Sino-Soviet
                    alliance as a pretty firm and fixed thing. I don't recall, either during that
                    period or subsequently when I was in Washington before the Sino-Soviet split,
                    which occurred somewhere around 1961, any of us who had enough sense to have
                    second thoughts and say, “Well, we should take a second look at this. Is this
                    going to last? Are there really cracks?” They were not overt certainly. It would
                    have taken a bit of imagination and prescience on our parts to realize the
                    possibility that that would come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at my own view, and others around me, I think we
                        did tend to see everything in East-West conflict, and that somehow or
                        another this Communism was a completely new phenomenon, which superseded
                        nationalism. And even though our noses had been rubbed in it, for example,
                        in Yugoslavia and some other places, we saw things as Communism in the Arab
                        world, looking at it later on. I mean, this was obviously nonsense. I think
                        of Arab... But it was a viewpoint.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Sure, world communism, world spirit of... I seem to recall when Tito
                    broke away, when was it, around 19...?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '48, '49.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: '48, '49, that there were people who refused to believe that it was
                    real. They thought it was a conspiracy to deceive us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of reporting were you getting? What were your
                        relations with our embassy on Taiwan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Close. I don't know whether we did much official travel back and forth,
                    except that Ambassador Rankin used to come over from time to time. I'm not sure
                    whether Mr. Drumright went over to Taiwan. Of course, he was later to succeed
                    Rankin as ambassador there. Most of us, for one reason or another, took trips
                    over there, but for personal reasons rather than business reasons. But we were
                    certainly aware of an exchange of information; we always received their reports
                    and they received ours.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I don't think so. There was really no independent China-watching
                    reporting from Taiwan. It was all in terms of what the Nationalist government
                    believed and what the national government was doing. Whatever some of the more
                    junior officers in Taiwan may have felt, there was no independent reporting, or
                    doubts about the Nationalist mission to recover the mainland and our commitment
                    to help them do so.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, this is an unclassified interview, and we are
                        talking about thirty years plus. Were you getting good information or much
                        information from the CIA? And how did you evaluate that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Again, I have a hard time separating what was happening then from what
                    was the case when I went back to Washington. We did have, of course, a large
                    Agency operation in Hong Kong. I'm sure we saw some of what was coming out of
                    there. I don't know how much. Again, I don't know to what extent the chief of
                    station reported to Mr. Drumright, and to what extent he operated independently.
                    You'd have to ask somebody like Mr. Drumright about that, I just don't know. I
                    have a feeling that they were pretty freewheeling, but I'm not sure. We used to
                    see some of their raw reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't have the feeling that they were reporting a
                        whole different situation or that they were really plugged in. At least from
                        what I gather, they were reporting more or less in the same stream that you
                        were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I honestly couldn't recall at this point. I don't ever recall having
                    been impressed that we were on different wave lengths.</p>
                <p>I might mention another source of information we had. Of course, there were so
                    few of us trying to pick so few tea leaves that we had a sort of informal group
                    there. We were in very close contact with the representatives of other
                    governments, particularly the British, French, Dutch, Australian, Japanese. Both
                    on a day-to-day basis and in regular evening sessions, we would get together.
                    And that included people from the press as well. There was quite a large press
                    presence there. A certain number of academics, such as a fellow named Doak
                    Barnett, whom you probably know of, a very eminent authority on China, who
                    happened to be there part of the time. We were all trying to exchange ideas,
                    pick each other's minds. And we did see some foreign government reports.
                    Particularly I recall the British reports and, in their case, that they were
                    ones written by their embassy in Peking, which they made available to us.</p>

                <p>LUTKINS: Yes. Ralph Clough had moved up to be acting in charge of the Office of
                    Chinese Affairs, and I replaced a fellow named Dave Osborn as his deputy. That
                    was within the bureau of what was then called Far Eastern Affairs, now East

                <p>LUTKINS: No, I think the way it operated was that we had the director of Chinese

                    and I was acting for a period of a few months. Then Ed Martin came in, was
                    brought back from London to be the director, and I was deputy director. And then
                    below that we had three or four officers who were working more or less on

                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: The perspective was different largely because of the people who were in
                    charge back in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we talk about that, please?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, sure. There was no question that the policy was very rigid,
                    representing the position and views of Walter Robertson and possibly Secretary
                    Dulles. I think possibly Robertson was more rigid than John Foster Dulles. But
                    Dulles, for political reasons and because of general sympathy with his position
                    gave Robertson a free hand on this and didn't try to buck him on it. There was
                    no question in Robertson's mind that we should be 100 percent pro-Nationalist
                    government on Taiwan and 100 percent anti-Communist government in Peking. There
                    was no suggestion that he would be prepared to even consider the possibility of
                    regularizing our relations with the Chinese Communists. He was certainly an
                    intelligent man, a very charming man, too, and an able man. I don't know whether
                    he ever, in the back of his mind, considered that at some point or other we
                    would have to adjust our position. But as far as I could make out, the
                    Communists would have had to have ceased being Communists to make him shift.</p>

                        mean, it was a fact of life. It wasn't through admiration, it was just,
                        well, let's get on with it. And it always seemed like it took us an awful
                        lot of time to get around to it. Was this the attitude of those who were
                        dealing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, I think in terms of foreign policy or realpolitik the feeling was
                    that this was a regime that was entrenched, it was going to be there for the
                    foreseeable future, and that we were going to have to deal with it.</p>
                <p>Mind you, I'm in contrast to many of the revisionist historians and still am
                    basically persuaded of the accuracy and truth of the State Department position,
                    as expressed in the 1949 White Paper, that we behaved, after the Chinese
                    Communist takeover, in the traditional manner of keeping our posts open on the
                    ground and being prepared to deal with the new power. And that it was not us,
                    but the Chinese Communists who did not want those relationships and, in effect,
                    forced us out. But, as I say, the revisionists dispute this.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, assuming that that is correct, I think those of us who were on
                    the spot during the period recognized that it takes two to tango, and that we
                    couldn't just automatically recognize the Chinese Communists. There would have
                    to be some negotiations and some terms involved. But I think most of us felt
                    that it would be sensible policy to start preparing for that, laying the
                    groundwork for it, and perhaps doing some probing to find out on what terms it
                    could be done.</p>
                <p>Whereas the official attitude in Washington was that these people were beyond
                    redemption, we couldn't possibly ever consider having relations with them, and
                    that, in addition, we would be betraying our friends on Taiwan.</p>

                        this regime. Now that you were back in Washington, was there any effort by
                        Robertson to say cut this, get them to talk more, or did he look for

                    secondary importance compared to the need to combat Communism and to stand by
                    our wartime allies and friends in Taiwan. And then I think you can't ignore the

                    president to make the shift. A Democrat couldn't do it, because he...</p>

                <p>LUTKINS: A Democratic president would have been immediately vulnerable on the
                    subject of being soft on Communism. Actually, it's rather interesting (I think I
                    had moved on to the Senior Seminar at that point), but it was very early in the
                    Kennedy years, in '61, that very gingerly tentative moves were made toward
                    opening up of relations with Outer Mongolia, which, of course, then was very
                    much still under Soviet domination. They didn't get very far on this. And part
                    of the reason was that the Nationalist government on Taiwan, of course, had
                    always regarded Outer Mongolia as Chinese territory that had been taken away
                    from China. They and the Chinese lobby made their opposition felt, so that it
                    just wasn't considered important enough by Kennedy to make an issue out of it,
                    and they dropped it.</p>

                <p>LUTKINS: Well, I can tell you something there. When I came back at the end of
                    '57, Ralph Clough briefed me on the general situation. I guess I must have
                    misunderstood what he said a bit, because I got the impression that perhaps the
                    Department was a little more flexible in our thinking about the future than
                    actually was the case.</p>
                <p>I was up in New York on a visit, and my father, who was in Wall Street asked me
                    to have lunch with a number of his friends and say a few words about China,
                    which I did. About a week later I got called into Robertson's office and raked
                    over the coals, because one of the people who had been present had the
                    impression from what I said that our policy toward China was changing. And
                    Robertson made it be known in no uncertain terms that it wasn't changing, and
                    that if I wanted to stay on board I'd better mind my manners. I think I had said
                    something along the lines that, “Well, surely at some point or other we'll have
                    to probably make an accommodation with the mainland.”</p>
                <p>I don't know whether you've interviewed Jeff Parsons, J. Graham Parsons, yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I haven't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: He would certainly be very important. He lives up in Massachusetts. I
                    guess he comes to Washington occasionally, might be willing to one day. He had a
                    very eminent career. He'd been my DCM in Tokyo, then he went to Laos as
                    ambassador and then came back to Washington as deputy to Walter Robertson. He
                    was a very savvy guy, and I'm sure he must have found it difficult working under
                    Robertson, and yet, being very professional, he adjusted and did his best at it.
                    Then later, I guess during the Kennedy years, I think he went off to finish his
                    career as ambassador to Sweden. He really had a meteoric rise in the service, a
                    very fine officer.</p>
                <p>Well, that's about it. I mean, we were very much under wraps as far as any
                    suggestions of any changes in policy. We just had to operate within that
                    framework.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Oh, very much so, yes. In fact, I was acting in charge when that erupted
                    in the fall of '58, because Ralph Clough had left and Ed Martin hadn't come back
                    yet. I was working extremely closely with Marshall Green, who, really, Robertson
                    had put in charge of a task force dealing with that problem. Marshall
                    spearheaded the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: You had these tiny little pieces of territory, these two islands in the
                    south, Quemoy and Matsu, and then a few others up a little closer near Shanghai.
                    They were a thorn in the flesh to the Chinese Communists, having these Chinese
                    Nationalist military outposts overlooking their territory. I don't think we were
                    really ever given any reason why they chose that particular time, which probably
                    was early September of '58, to start this campaign. But they started to bombard
                    the two islands, and it became a cause c�l�bre.</p>
                <p>I remember Secretary Dulles was up in the Thousand Islands on vacation at the
                    time, but he came back shortly. And then there were all sorts of high-level
                    discussions over a period of a month or six weeks, involving, of course, at a
                    very high level, the Pentagon, Admiral Arleigh Burke, who I think was naval
                    chief of staff at the time, or joint chief of staff. And there were discussions
                    as to whether we might ultimately have to use nuclear weapons or not. It didn't
                    come to that. It was a question of helping the Nationalists get supplies into
                    these beleaguered outposts. I think it was on that occasion that there was the
                    first use of air-to-air missiles called Sidewinders, which proved quite
                    effective. We didn't have any of our own forces involved, but we were supplying
                    the Nationalists with weaponry.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, after several months, the Chinese Communists backed off, instituted a
                    cease-fire, and proposed talks at an ambassadorial level.</p>
                <p>There had been some earlier talks, held in Geneva, following the Geneva
                    Conference in '55. I think Alex Johnson did the talking for the United States's
                    side. And they had petered out, because they weren't getting anywhere; both
                    sides just reiterated their grievances. We complained about the Chinese holding
                    American citizens against their will. And they complained about our supporting
                    the Nationalists and thus interfering in Chinese affairs.</p>
                <p>As I say, at a certain point they broke off, but when the truce was reached in
                    the Quemoy-Matsu offshore island crisis, we and the Chinese agreed to resume
                    these talks. They were held in Warsaw, where their ambassador, who I think was
                    Wang Ping-nan, talked to our ambassador, Jake Beam, who I'm sure you've
                    interviewed. And Ralph Clough, who was DCM in Switzerland, used to go down to
                    Warsaw and act as Beam's political advisor in these talks. For a period of a
                    year or more these talks dragged on, getting absolutely nowhere. Both sides
                    repeating the same positions. We had to spend a lot of time in Washington
                    preparing the talking points for the sessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you personally feel about Quemoy-Matsu and then
                        the talks? How did you see these things in relative importance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, I don't think any of us regarded Quemoy and Matsu of any
                    overreaching importance. But, at the same time, they were Chinese Nationalist
                    outposts, and we were committed to the defense of the Chinese Nationalists, so
                    that we really had no choice but to help them resist the attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when the Kennedy administration took over
                        in '61?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I guess I was there for the first six months, but then I went off to the
                    Senior Seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they came in, in January, and you went to the Senior
                        Seminar in about August.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: August, September. Actually, there was a two-or three-month period there
                    where I was asked to take over very briefly the Far East Bureau's Office of UN
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the new team that came on board? The
                        difference between the Dulles team and the Rusk team, in your area of
                        responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: To my recollection, it didn't really filter down immediately to the
                    bureau level. Jeff Parsons, who had been deputy assistant secretary in FE,
                    succeeded Walter Robertson as assistant secretary. And then at some point early
                    in the Kennedy administration, Jeff Parsons was sent off to Sweden as
                    ambassador. He was succeeded as assistant secretary by Walter McConaughy. Again,
                    I don't know whether you've interviewed him. He lives down in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He lives down in Sea Island, Georgia, or some place like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Somewhere in Georgia, maybe Atlanta, I'm not sure. And John Steeves was
                    the deputy assistant secretary. But my recollection is that there was certainly
                    no abrupt visible change in policy. I think the new administration was feeling
                    its way. And, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, the domestic political
                    factor, it wasn't about to engage in any sudden, dramatic change in policy. It
                    was still feeling its way.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>And Walter McConaughy, who was a very experienced officer and held four or five
                    chief of mission posts, from what I've been told by people close to him and
                    others, was not a success as an assistant secretary. He apparently found it very
                    difficult to delegate, and things piled up on his desk. If you'll remember the
                    Kennedy era, particularly in the early days, top administration people were
                    given to calling from the White House directly and asking for an answer, even at
                    a desk- officer level. And they reportedly found his very slow, methodical
                    procedures and methods very time consuming and frustrating. So I don't think he
                    lasted much more than about six months, and then Averell Harriman was brought in
                    to succeed him. And by that time I was out and at the Senior Seminar. I think at
                    that time there may have begun a change in our policy, but I couldn't speak to
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you went to the Senior Seminar, which, for the
                        record, is the equivalent to the State Department's war college, designed
                        for senior officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: We also had a smattering of attendance by representatives of the armed
                    services and the CIA and Treasury and so forth. An outstanding feature of the
                    Seminar experience was the amount of domestic travel that it offered. This was
                    invaluable in enabling officers who had spent most of their careers abroad to
                    reacquaint themselves with the broad diversity of American society and
                    government. We were exposed not only, as at the National War College, to
                    national security operations (Norfolk, Fort Benning, NORAD, etc.) but also to
                    American industry (a steel plant in Pittsburgh, a Ford assembly line in Detroit,
                    Boeing in Seattle), politics (a session with Mayor Daley in Chicago, the labor
                    movement (Walter Reuter), the university scene (Duke), and a wide range of
                    eminent Americans including Justice Felix Frankfurter, Walter Lippmann, and
                    Henry Kissinger. In addition, since the Seminar was amply funded in those days,
                    each of us was able to take a foreign trip related to a subject on which one was
                    expected to write a paper. My subject being “Neutralist Trends in Pakistan's
                    Foreign Policy”, I was able to spend some three weeks visiting the major
                    Pakistani cities (including Dacca, since the eastern wing of the country had not
                    yet split off to become Bangladesh) as well as New Delhi, Tehran, and London.
                    This provided a useful overview of a region new to me, South Asia, and
                    coincidentally was helpful in connection with my ongoing posting to Ceylon as
                    deputy chief of mission.</p>
                <p>I had had my eye on and was more or less promised the job of the Far East liaison
                    officer at the embassy in London. In those days, we used to have a man in
                    London, a man in Paris and so forth. Which I would have loved, but Personnel
                    came up with the DCM assignment in Ceylon, and career-wise it seemed more
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is. I mean, DCM is...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: So I was not unhappy at all about it. And, of course, Personnel saw it
                    as a getting out of one's area and getting a little bit of broadening. And it
                    was a very interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two ambassadors there, Frances Willis and Cecil
                        Lyon. I wonder if you could compare and contrast their styles, how they
                        operated, and how they used you as a DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, that's a very good question. And there certainly was a marked
                    contrast there. They were both old pros. Frances Willis I guess was our first
                    career woman ambassador. She had already served as chief of mission in Bern,
                    Switzerland, and then in Oslo, and this was to be her last post. But, as I said,
                    she was a thorough professional, had come up from the ranks and knew the Service
                    inside out and the regulations, and knew everybody's job in the embassy better
                    than they did. But she was not a delegator. I don't mean to say that she didn't
                    have a good grasp of the overall situation, but she couldn't resist immersing
                    herself in every detail in every section of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been a little bit difficult, being deputy
                        chief of mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: It didn't leave too much for the DCM to do except carry out some of her
                    wishes, naturally. I found her a delightful woman and a very intelligent, able
                    woman, but the contrast with her and Cecil Lyon was very marked. I served with
                    Frances Willis for two years and Cecil for one. Cecil Lyon's approach was that,
                    after about three months of working together and sizing me up, he said, “The
                    embassy is yours. I'll concentrate on the big picture, and you run the
                    embassy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our policy and our interest in Sri... Was it Sri
                        Lanka at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, it had not yet become Sri Lanka, it was still Ceylon and a British
                    dominion. And it had a governor general, who, although a Ceylonese, was
                    appointed by the Queen. Under which there was an elected prime minister, who at
                    that time was the widow of an assassinated prime minister, Bandaranaike. When he
                    was assassinated, they brought his wife in, who had no political experience but
                    was fairly shrewd. She was not too experienced and was rather subject to
                    manipulation and pressures by some of her political associates and advisors.</p>
                <p>Her government, if not Leftist, was Leftist leaning. It was allied with the
                    Socialists and even the very minute Communist element there. In fact, they had
                    two Communist parties: the regular Communist Party and a Trotskyite Party. It
                    was rather fragmented. Her government had been preceded by and was to be
                    followed by a conservative government.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>But, as I say, at that time, in '62 and for another couple of years, there was
                    this Left-leaning government. Left- leaning, not so much socially, because Mrs.
                    Bandaranaike came from one of the leading land-owning families in the country
                    and was basically fairly conservative in her viewpoint. But the foreign policy
                    they were following pretty much tended to be a neutralist, Third-World-country
                    line, allied with countries like India and Ghana and Indonesia and so forth. So
                    that we were having some problems with them in foreign policy viewpoints and
                    attitudes and positions.</p>
                <p>It came to a head not long after I got there, because they put through a law
                    nationalizing foreign oil companies: Standard Vacuum, Caltex, and, on the
                    British side, Shell. Which wasn't earthshaking or anything, but it caused a
                    major problem for us, because the Senate and Congress had recently passed
                    something called the Hickenlooper Amendment, which made it incumbent on us to
                    terminate any economic aid program to any country that had nationalized an
                    American company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was: nationalized and had not made steps
                        towards compensation within six months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Not made proper compensation, right. Your memory is better than
                    mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've just been dealing with an oral history dealing
                        with this major problem in Peru.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Oh, that followed it, I think, yes. I don't think they ever went to the
                    extent of actually implementing the Hickenlooper Amendment in Peru, did
                    they?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A long account by Ernest Seracusa of how they circumvented
                        that, with the collusion of the president and everyone else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: We were the guinea pigs in Ceylon, because they were bent on enforcing
                    it. And, of course, it meant major tension in our relations with the government.
                    We had endless negotiations at high levels, including the prime minister and the
                    ambassador and so forth. I think they may have sent somebody out from
                    Washington, too, but I can't recall.</p>
                <p>But the upshot was that they wouldn't provide guarantees of what we considered
                    prompt and effective restitution. So that we did close down our AID program.
                    They retaliated by shutting down our Peace Corps program in the country.</p>
                <p>And things were rather tense for quite awhile. I think they actually had some
                    demonstrations. The ambassador and I and one or two others spent the afternoon
                    playing bridge while she was burned in effigy outside.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>There was a local election a year or so later, and the conservative government,
                    which we were quite obviously sympathetic to, came back into power. I was gone
                    by then, I don't know what was dreamed up in terms of a settlement of the oil
                    company claims. Apparently it was sufficient for our purposes, so that we
                    resumed relations on a normal scale.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I guess a year or two later, we sent a Peace Corps contingent back
                    in again, which I thought was a great mistake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, it's interesting. It goes back to the beginning of why we had a
                    Peace Corps presence there in the first place. That was, of course, a major
                    initiative of the Kennedy administration. I thought it was an example of the
                    American way of not doing things as well as they might.</p>
                <p>What they did (and I wasn't there at the time, it was before I arrived), the
                    Peace Corps sent out young emissaries to various countries and tried to persuade
                    them that they needed a Peace Corps group. Well, some of these countries,
                    including Ceylon, really couldn't have cared less whether they had a Peace Corps
                    or not. But it was free and so they were prepared to take it. But they had no
                    real idea what they would do with one when they got it.</p>
                <p>It turned out, I think, and this may have been true in some other countries as
                    well, that they were engaged almost exclusively, if not entirely, in English
                    language training. I'd have to look at the records, but I don't recall there
                    being any cases in Ceylon where they were actually working on village
                    improvements, infrastructure. But I do know that they were teaching English.</p>
                <p>To my mind, it's indicative of the general American approach, and not just in
                    foreign policy, the idea that if X is good, 10X is bound to be ten times as good
                    as X, and that therefore you want to get numbers. And the people back in
                    Washington trying to, very crudely I suppose, build an empire, although I'm sure
                    from a very idealistic point of view.</p>
                <p>It may have been so in other countries, I think in Ceylon it was definitely a
                    case of forcing this down their throats. And then when they pulled it out, I
                    think it was a great mistake to go back and put it back in, but that's as it may
                    be. I frankly didn't feel, in the year or two that they were there when I was
                    there, that they were really accomplishing terribly much.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>You can look at the Peace Corps in, I guess, three different ways. First, that it
                    actually accomplished something on the spot. And I guess in certain cases it
                    did. Second, you might say it was good public relations in persuading the
                    foreign country that the Americans were pretty decent chaps after all, and
                    really wanted to be of help, and were not like the hated colonials. Third, I
                    think that the most useful effect of the Peace Corps was to give exposure to
                    young Americans who then would come back and have some knowledge about the
                    world. But maybe I'm overly cynical.</p>

                <p>LUTKINS: Did we get many people?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did. I was on the Board of Examiners, and they were

                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Before moving on from Ceylon it might not be out of order for me to
                    comment briefly on the country itself at that point in time in the post-colonial
                    era Third World. It seemed to me, in retrospect, to exemplify the pattern of
                    development (albeit on a small scale because of the country's relatively small
                    size) of at least a number of Asian countries that were granted their
                    independence following World War II. In Ceylon's case the new independent
                    government inherited from the former colonial power, England, institutions such
                    as a shared language of government, a bureaucratic infrastructure, and an
                    impartial judiciary, all of which cut across and blurred racial, religious, and
                    language lines: Singhalese-Buddhist, Tamil-Hindu, Christian, Muslim. But after
                    the restraining, moderating, and unifying lid of colonial overlordship was
                    removed, gradually and at an accelerating rate the centuries- old ethnic and
                    religious differences, mistrust, and animosities reemerged. This would have been
                    difficult for any government, however strong and well-intentioned, to control.
                    But Ceylon, like some other new, post-colonial states, was operating under a
                    more or less imposed Western-style democratic constitution which provided for
                    regular elections based on universal suffrage. It was simply expecting too much
                    of the average Ceylonese villager or farmer, whether Singhalese-Buddhist or
                    Tamil-Hindu, to abandon his society's age-old parochial beliefs and vote in
                    terms of broad enlightened national interests. The result was that with each
                    post-independence election one found in Parliament and therefore in the
                    government more and more men representing and advocating views and policies
                    which were conceived in narrow factional rather than broad national terms. Which
                    has all led increasingly to the sad picture of modern-day Sri Lanka rent by
                    bloody civil strife between Singhalese and Tamils and its once reasonably
                    healthy economy in tatters.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, maybe we might move on. I don't want to
                        overdwell on the time that you were an inspector from '65 to '67 and then in
                        personnel and performance evaluation. When you were an inspector, were there
                        any notable problems that you had to deal with that you think would be
                        illuminating as how the system worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: More so on the departmental experience than on the inspection. The
                    Inspection Corps was a very interesting experience. Of course, they have
                    revamped the Inspection Corps since, from what it was then, but I always thought
                    it was of somewhat marginal usefulness. I suppose it kept posts on their toes,
                    but in many ways I think the most useful contribution of the inspectors in those
                    days was to write individual efficiency reports, which perhaps gave a little bit
                    of a balance to what was being prepared on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was my impression, and then they gutted that some
                        years later. They came and you kind of wondered what they were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes. I have had no experience with it subsequently and I don't know what
                    they're doing. I had heard that they were actually now to look at policy toward
                    the country, which, of course, we stayed away from. We were no experts in local
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this sounds like a duplication, and at a low level,
                        which isn't really going to be paid much attention to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: But as far as the inspectors' efficiency reports, we were always told by
                    the panels back in Washington that they relied very heavily on these reports,
                    because they found them an impartial counterweight to what was written at the
                    post. In fact, I always felt that as an inspector I was sort of playing God, on
                    the basis of a very brief exposure to people, to try and write a report that was
                    going to be taken so seriously in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, speaking of that, from '67 to '69 you were the
                        director of performance evaluation. Would you explain what this is, because
                        this is a fairly interesting place, sort of on the pulse of the Foreign
                        Service. I wonder if you could talk about this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, it operated within the office of the Director General and the
                    overall control of the under secretary for administration, who in those days was
                    Idar Rimestad. The Director General was John Steeves, an old friend. It had the
                    dual responsibility of, one, administering this whole system of efficiency
                    reports. In the first place, preparing the report forms, seeing that they were
                    prepared on time by the posts, and then reviewing them to see that there were no
                    cases of obvious bias or injustice being done. Receiving any complaints from the
                    posts about problems that might have arisen between personnel, reflected in the
                    reports. And secondly, of course, the counterpart, of administering the annual
                    review boards in Washington, assembling them, bringing people in from the field
                    to serve on them and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the system? Were you comfortable with
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, I don't think anybody could be completely comfortable with it. I
                    mean, there's no perfect system. You were always wondering. As you, a career
                    officer, know, the efficiency report forms were being changed every couple of
                    years, tinkered with. And because of that whole problem, the honesty of
                    reporting would get watered down. If an officer was facing selection out, after
                    a number of years without promotion in grade, there was a tendency on the part
                    of reporting officers and senior reviewing officers to try to do right by him
                    by...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being a little more fulsome, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: To put it mildly. And so we were constantly trying to figure out ways to
                    make the reports more meaningful. Though at times they were classified. We were
                    under great pressure at that time to eliminate any confidentiality, because it
                    was felt that this was unfair to personnel, who wouldn't learn about anything
                    that was said adversely about them until they got back and reviewed their file
                    in Washington. So, while I was in charge, we came up with a two-part system,
                    which, as you may remember, was an unclassified section and a classified
                    section, a confidential section. I think that lasted for about a couple of
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That didn't last long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: There was too much pressure for openness. But, as I say, we constantly
                    were studying methods of evaluation by private industry and other organizations,
                    to see if there was anything better that we could come up with. I never felt
                    that what we had was perfect, or that we'd ever achieve anything perfect.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The Foreign Service is an institution where, unfortunately, you can't have
                    complete openness. If you have a small, two-man post, men working together
                    closely day and night for a couple of years, it's very difficult for the fellow
                    in charge to write a completely honest, unbiased report—and then tell the fellow
                    about it. So I don't know what the answer is, but we were constantly wrestling
                    with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For your last overseas post, you went to Johannesburg as
                        consul general. You were there from '69 to '73. As a China hand, how did you
                        end up there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, that's interesting. I had always expected to go back to the Far
                    East, my home area in the Foreign Service. And, actually, while I was serving in
                    Washington, I got a chance to go back to Taiwan as DCM, which I would have liked
                    to have done. But John Steeves, as the director general, felt I had only been in
                    the job in Washington for one year and was loath to let me go. So I went along
                    with that. Careerwise I should have stayed in the Far East. I think it's a
                    truism that you do best if you develop a home base and stick to it, where you're
                    known.</p>
                <p>But, be that as it may, by the time I came up for an assignment in '69, there
                    weren't many suitable positions available in the Far East. I was offered the
                    Johannesburg job and took it. It turned out to be a fascinating post, although
                    it was a dead end careerwise. But it was a very interesting period to be in
                    South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? You were in Johannesburg, the embassy
                        was still in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Pretoria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Pretoria and Cape Town, or does it rotate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: No, they divide the time each year. The administrative area of the
                    government is centered in Pretoria, but the parliament meets in Cape Town. Which
                    means that the senior elements of government, particularly the political side,
                    move down to Cape Town for anywhere from four to six months while Parliament is
                    in session. So that at that period of the year the embassy is divided, since the
                    Ambassador, the DCM, and the Political Section go to Cape Town with the
                    government.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The thing is complicated by the fact that Pretoria and Johannesburg are only
                    about 40 miles apart. And whereas the politics is completely centered in
                    Pretoria, and to a lesser extent in Cape Town when the government is down there,
                    except for that, everything important is in Johannesburg. It is the center of
                    industry and commerce, the leading educational center, the leading media center,
                    etc. Except for politics everything is centered in Johannesburg, with lesser
                    developments in Durban on the east coast and at Cape Town in the south.</p>
                <p>Which makes for a rather complicated situation, because the staff in Johannesburg
                    was really limited, and many of the functions there were really national in
                    scope. For instance, our chief commercial officer was based in Johannesburg;
                    similarly the mineral attach� with national responsibilities and a labor officer
                    with national responsibilities. So, in a sense, although they were part of my
                    staff, they were also reporting to Pretoria. So it was not a very tidy situation
                    personnel-wise, but it worked out.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: He came in, in '69. Yes, he was president the entire time I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the policy and how did it reflect on what you
                        did? South Africa has been controversial for a long time, but what was our
                        policy and how did you operate with it there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Incidentally, of course, policywise I was like the consuls general in
                    Durban and Cape Town. I was completely, under Pretoria, but acting independently
                    in my consular district. The only difference was that, being so close, I would
                    attend the weekly staff meeting in Pretoria.</p>
                <p>Our policy at that time was rather similar to that during the Reagan years, in
                    that it followed a period, under Lyndon Johnson, when Soapy Williams was
                    assistant secretary for Africa, and where the emphasis was very much on civil
                    rights, and supporting the new African governments, black governments and so
                    forth, and harshly critical of the South African apartheid regime. Under Nixon,
                    while we remained hostile to the system of apartheid, it became somewhat the
                    policy, as in the Reagan years, where we toned down our criticism of the South
                    African government and tried to work with it by persuasion, to get it to adjust
                    to changes rather than bludgeoning it. Which I personally thought was a very
                    sensible policy. I've never been very much in favor of the later idea of
                    sanctions, because I don't think it's the way to get South Africa to change, and
                    because I don't think they have been all that effective.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>But, be that as it may, it was a period of relative calm in South Africa. There
                    was no major unrest. The underlying injustices and weaknesses of the system were
                    obvious, but things were quiet. Following the outbreak of protests and disorder
                    in the early '60s, they subsided, and the thing was not to flare up again until
                    the mid-'70s, after I left.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, as a Consul General I had no connection with the South African
                    government.</p>

                <p>LUTKINS: Well, that's an interesting point. At the time and traditionally the
                    Johannesburg city government was dominated by the opposition party and the
                    English-speaking business element, so that there was never any possible tension
                    with them. And relations with the Afrikaner-dominated central government were
                    handled by Pretoria. I had no reason whatever to come in contact with them. I
                    would have been intruding on Pretoria's...</p>

                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: They were difficult people to deal with, but, as I say, it just didn't
                    enter into the picture. Although my consular district included
                    Afrikaner-dominated areas, and I did travel around and talk to people, it wasn't
                    up to me to be discussing policy with them. So it was really more or less
                    courtesy calls whenever I spoke to them.</p>

                    general policy was to make contact to the extent we could with such black
                    leaders, or embryonic black leaders, as we could identify, and to entertain
                    blacks. And we went in for that in quite a big way, I think more so than
                    Pretoria.</p>
                <p>The South African government knew that we were entertaining blacks. They did not
                    approve of it, but they didn't try to prevent it. So, for instance, when we had
                    a Fourth of July party, they knew we were going to have blacks present and they
                    would not send any white South African government official to attend. They would
                    boycott it, which really didn't mean anything in the case of Johannesburg,
                    because there were no South African officials that I would normally have invited
                    anyway. But it did affect Pretoria.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>But we were quite successful in this interracial entertaining. On many occasions,
                    and particularly when we had visitors from the United States, congressional or
                    from other fields, I would have stag dinner parties at which we would have a
                    number of our black contacts present from various fields, and then have
                    influential whites as well, from the business community, academic community and
                    this sort of thing. And the latter were almost pathetically grateful, because
                    this was, in many cases, the first time they had ever spoken to a black in terms
                    of equality. It had always been a master-servant relationship, because that was
                    what they had been brought up with and what the system involved. So that it was
                    an eye- opening experience for them, which they appreciated.</p>
                <p>And we also were able to go out and visit blacks in their homes, in Soweto, the
                    huge black township area outside Johannesburg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Soweto, was this before or after the...? Wasn't there a
                        major riot of sorts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: That came later in the mid-'70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem with your staff feeling
                        uncomfortable in this situation? Or were you having to ride herd on them and
                        say, “Well, our policy is not one of confrontation,” or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Are you talking about the American staff?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American staff, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Oh, I see. No, I don't think there was major uneasiness on the part of
                    any of the staff. I think most of them were very realistic. If anything, there
                    were one or two who were more South African white than the South African whites.
                    One of them chose, when he retired, to settle down there. No, I don't think
                    there was any major agitation on the part of the staff, for a more activist,
                    confrontational policy. And I don't believe that was true in Pretoria either.
                    Everybody knew that the Afrikaners, and the Afrikaner politicians in particular,
                    were difficult people to deal with. And I'm sure there was no great love lost on
                    the part of the embassy personnel for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador most of the time you were there was John
                        Hurd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, but for much of the first year it was Bill Rountree. He was sick a
                    lot of the time at the beginning. He and his wife both got hepatitis. I guess he
                    must have been there about maybe the first six months I was there, and then he
                    was succeeded by John Hurd, who was a Texas oil man.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Surprisingly well. He had originally been nominated to be ambassador to
                    Venezuela. And then I guess the Venezuelans objected, because of his oil
                    connections, so he was sent to South Africa. A very bright, personable guy, and
                    I think he handled the job very professionally. He was certainly easy to work
                    with. He didn't try to throw his weight around. He accepted the advice of his
                    professional staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major problems you had to deal with while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: From the administrative point of view, personnel point of view, I've
                    mentioned the difficulty trying to run an office in which a lot of the officers
                    had a divided responsibility to the Embassy and the Consul General.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, most of my work turned out to be semi- political in the sense of
                    reporting on developments. I didn't get involved, except in a supervisory
                    capacity, in commercial work or in consular work. I got more involved, perhaps,
                    on the labor side, because part of our policy was to try and encourage the
                    American firms doing business in South Africa, and there was a very substantial,
                    one- or two- billion-dollar American investment in South Africa, with many of
                    the very large American companies represented.</p>
                <p>One of our objectives there was to try and get the American companies to take the
                    lead in introducing more open, liberal labor practices, as a contrast to the
                    rather restrictive ones of the South Africans. You know, equal amenities and
                    opportunities for blacks to improve themselves and this sort of thing. This was
                    before the thing really came into focus in the 1970s. At which time there was a
                    Reverend something Sullivan, who laid down some rules for American companies to
                    follow. It was all involved in this agitation for sanctions and withdrawal of
                    investments and so forth. But this was before all of that, and we were in the
                    forefront.</p>
                <p>The labor attach� and I would go around and visit many of the American company
                    installations there. Not in a high-handed manner at all, but just inquiring
                    about what they were doing and so forth. Also, not too subtly, we would let them
                    know that Washington favored more enlightened practices on their part. That was
                    quite interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then left there in 1973, and you had one further
                        assignment. What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LUTKINS: Well, actually I had two, but neither one was terribly meaningful. One
                    was as a diplomat-in-residence, which turned out to be at the University of
                    Arkansas, in Fayetteville, Arkansas. I guess you know the diplomat-in-residence
                    program. They tried to spread it around the country, in different years in
                    different areas. At that particular point, Arkansas apparently had been asking
                    for a diplomat-in- residence, and I was sent there.</p>
                <p>It was rather amusing, because it, of course, was the old stamping ground of
                    Senator Fulbright, who had been president of the university before he came to
                    Washington. It was his hometown, also. I guess his family had run a newspaper
                    there. The practice was, as a courtesy before going out to a state like that, to
                    call on the senators involved. So I called on Senator Fulbright. He, of course,
                    was notoriously suspicious of the State Department, and regarded this as a
                    propaganda effort to sell the administration's foreign policy line. I don't
                    think I was successful in my effort to convince him that we weren't out there to
                    propagandize but to do something which I thought that he would be in favor of.
                    And that was to try to increase awareness at the student level of what goes into
                    the formulation and implementation of foreign policy. And, an important factor
                    also, to get around the local community and create awareness of the State
                    Department and its role.</p>
                <p>Mine was a typical diplomat-in-residence year. The first term I just was a guest
                    lecturer, and then the second term I gave a couple of courses, a general one on
                    foreign affairs and foreign policy and also a seminar on Southern Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you came back and worked for about a year on the
                        International Population Year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes, it was a sort of make-work job. It was a period when senior
                    officers were walking the corridors. That was all they could offer me, so I
                    thought it would be worth taking for a year and use it as an opportunity to see
                    what might be available in the future.</p>
                <p>Yes, well, 1974 had been called International Population Year. I'm not sure
                    whether it was designated by the United Nations or by the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably by the United Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: I think so. But, in any case, as part of the United Nations'
                    International Population Year, the administration, as I guess they frequently
                    do, appointed a commission to make some input to this thing. I'd never had any
                    experience with these organizations before, but I guess it's a typical political
                    process, where they pick people representing different points of view so they'll
                    be sure and come up with something bland.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>It was headed by a man who had been secretary of agriculture under Nixon,
                    Clifford Hardin. He had also been president of the University of Nebraska, and
                    was retired, and was working for one of these big agro-industrial combines,
                    Ralston Purina. And then there was a mix of people on the commission: men,
                    women, Catholics, others. It was a very mixed bag.</p>
                <p>We were supposed to study the problem of population and come up with a report. I
                    was given a very small staff and asked to administer this thing. It proved
                    rather frustrating. As with all these things, the end product is hardly worth
                    the money put into it. Because we were so late getting started, we broadened the
                    context to include food, because I guess the following year was to be
                    International Food Year, with a conference in Rome. With the help of Edwin M.
                    Martin and Phil Claxton, on the population side, we cobbled together a report
                    finally at the end of the year, and did a few other activities, including an
                    exhibition on the Mall.</p>
                <p>The report was certainly nothing earthshaking, but we pointed out the dimensions
                    of the population problem and the dangers and whatnot. It was just
                    disappointing, because all our work, to whatever extent it was worthwhile, was
                    completely undercut. The chairman, exercising his prerogative, wrote an
                    introduction in which he completely pooh-poohed the existence of a population
                    problem, and said, in effect, that modern technology, agriculture and otherwise,
                    would take care of the problem and the world could feed any number of people
                    indefinitely. As I say, nobody would have read the report anyway and it was
                    probably just filed away, but anyway, the experience was mildly
                    discouraging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on that sort of down note, but this has been a
                        fascinating discussion. You then retired, I take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LUTKINS: Yes. At that point, again, there were very few suitable senior positions
                    going around, and I decided to take the opportunity and get out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you very much, this was fascinating.</hi>
